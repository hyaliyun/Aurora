Question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In June 1963, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a major speech in Detroit that foreshadowed his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in Washington, D.C. two months later. While the African-American Civil Rights Movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the Twelfth Street riot in July 1967. Governor George W. Romney ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades. It was the most costly riot in the United States.\\"?

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To charge a power drill battery,","output":"To determine which solution is better for the goal of charging a power drill battery, let's evaluate some common charging methods and technologies available today. We will consider factors such as efficiency, convenience, cost, and charging time. Here are a few common charging approaches: 1. Traditional Wall Charger 2. Fast Charger 3. Solar Battery Charger 4. Wireless Charging 1. Traditional Wall Charger: A traditional wall charger is usually the standard accessory provided with a power drill when you purchase the tool. These chargers are designed to work with the specific battery type and voltage of your power tool. They plug directly into a wall socket and are connected to the battery for charging. Pros: - Generally included with the power drill purchase - Simple and easy to use - Reliable and consistent charging performance Cons: - Standard charging time can be longer compared to other methods (usually between 3-5 hours) - Tethered to a wall socket, limiting mobility 2. Fast Charger: A fast charger is designed to charge power drill batteries more quickly than traditional wall chargers. These chargers use advanced charging technology to regulate the flow of electricity and reduce charging time. Pros: - Reduced charging time (usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours) - May include smart charging features to prevent overcharging and extend battery life - Can potentially increase productivity by reducing downtime Cons: - More expensive than traditional wall chargers - May generate more heat while charging, which could impact battery life over time 3. Solar Battery Charger: A solar battery charger uses solar panels to harness energy from the sun and convert it into electricity to charge a power drill battery. This is an eco-friendly charging method that reduces reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Pros: - Environmentally friendly - No dependency on wall sockets, allowing for greater mobility - Potentially lower ongoing energy costs Cons: - Charging times may be longer and dependent on sunlight exposure - Less efficient in cloudy or low-light conditions - Initial setup costs can be higher compared to other methods 4. Wireless Charging: Wireless charging uses electromagnetic fields to transfer energy and charge a power drill battery without a wired connection. The battery is placed on a charging pad or in close proximity to the charging station, and the charging process begins. Pros: - Enhanced convenience due to the elimination of cords - Less wear and tear on charging ports of the battery - May include smart charging features Cons: - Slower charging times compared to fast chargers - Limited range of compatible power drill batteries - Additional expense for the wireless charging station Overall, the best solution for charging a power drill battery depends on individual preferences and needs. If convenience and reduced downtime are the highest priority, a fast charger may be the best choice due to its quick charging times and smart charging features. For those who are environmentally conscious and don't mind slightly longer charging times, a solar battery charger would be a suitable option. If the primary focus is ease-of-use and lower cost, a traditional wall charger will suffice. Lastly, for those who want to invest in a cord-free, modern charging method, wireless charging may be the ideal solution."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In-line skating is a fun sport that everyone can enjoy. Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. The answer is:","output":"Which of the following steps is important for learning how to fall safely while in-line skating? A. Step 1: Gear up! B. Step 2: Buckle up! C. Step 3: Fall down! D.

James is driving down the street in his town. For some reason today hes very curious about the things that he sees. He looks around as hes driving and the street lights catch his attention. He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside.  Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","output":"The vapor light is more energy-efficient than a regular light bulb. Here's a detailed and long answer to explain why this is the case and to provide some background information about street lights, vapor lights, and regular light bulbs. Street lights have evolved over the years to become more energy-efficient and provide better illumination for roads, sidewalks, and other outdoor areas. The two most common types of street lights are high-pressure sodium (HPS) vapor lights and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. When comparing these street lights to regular incandescent light bulbs, both HPS vapor lights and LED lights outperform in terms of energy efficiency, lifespan, and overall performance. High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) Vapor Lights: High-pressure sodium vapor lights are a type of high-intensity discharge (HID) lighting that has been widely used for street lighting applications since the 1970s. The HPS light contains a mix of xenon, sodium, and mercury gases in a ceramic arc tube. When an electric current is passed through the tube, it ionizes the gases and produces a bright yellow-orange light. Energy efficiency: HPS lights are much more energy-efficient than regular incandescent light bulbs. Typically, an HPS light can produce 50-140 lumens per watt, while an incandescent light bulb produces only about 15 lumens per watt. As a result, HPS lights require less wattage to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb, leading to lower energy consumption and electricity costs. Light-emitting Diode (LED) Lights: LED lights are semiconductor devices that emit light when an electric current passes through them. In recent years, they have become the preferred choice for street lighting due to their long lifespan, environmental friendliness, and energy efficiency. Energy efficiency: LED lights are even more energy-efficient than HPS lights, with an efficacy of up to 100-150 lumens per watt. Due to their energy-efficient nature, LEDs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease the overall energy consumption of streetlights. In conclusion, if we only consider energy efficiency, the vapor lights (HPS) outperform the regular incandescent light bulbs. However, LED lights are now the most energy-efficient option available on the market for street lighting applications. Additionally, they offer other benefits, such as longer life, improved color rendering, and reduced maintenance costs. As a result, LED lights are now being installed in many cities worldwide as part of energy-saving initiatives and to create safer and more visually appealing urban environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: when did france and great britain declare war on germany?","output":"France and Great Britain declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, in response to Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. The invasion marked the beginning of World War II, a devastating global conflict that lasted until 1945. The root cause of the war lied in the unresolved issues and resentments from World War I. After the Treaty of Versailles – signed on June 28, 1919 – Germany suffered significant territorial losses, crippling economic reparations, and military limitations. The treaty left the German nation humiliated and discontented, giving rise to radical political groups such as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) led by Adolf Hitler. In 1933, Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany and implemented aggressive expansionist policies, violating the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria followed by the Munich Agreement in September 1938, through which Germany seized the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939, Germany proceeded to occupy the remaining territories of Czechoslovakia, violating the Munich Agreement. The invasion of Poland was the culmination of Germany's aggressive actions and prompted France and Great Britain to act. Both countries had signed mutual defense pacts with Poland earlier in the year, promising to protect Polish sovereignty. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, causing France and Great Britain to issue ultimatums demanding the immediate withdrawal of German forces from Poland. Germany ignored these ultimatums leading France and Great Britain to formally declare war on Germany on September 3, 1939. The war eventually resulted in the formation of two major opposing alliances: the Allies, which mainly consisted of France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and the Axis Powers, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. World War II resulted in millions of casualties, widespread destruction, and immense human suffering. The war concluded in September 1945 with the unconditional surrender of Germany to the Allies, marking the end of Hitler's Third Reich and the advent of a new world order shaped by the collaboration of the victorious powers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors.

So let's count: 779 apples + 14 apples = 793 apples Now our equation looks like this: 0 = -61*y - 793 In order to get y alone, we need to move 793 to the other side of the equal sign. When we move a number to the other side, we change its sign. Since -793 is negative, when we move it to the other side, it will become positive: 0 + 793 = -61*y Which is the same as: 793 = -61*y Almost done! Now, we need to get y alone. We have -61 times y, so we need to divide both sides by -61 to solve for y. It's like sharing 793 pieces of candy equally among -61 (hungry, but imaginary) friends: 793 ÷ -61 = y And when we divide, we get: -13 = y So, the answer is: y = -13 If that was a bit complicated, just remember that we solved the puzzle to find that y is equal to -13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: A colorful pebble falls on a goldfish, where is the pebble? Possible A: aquarium, creek, pet store, playground, pond  Why is \\"aquarium\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Aquarium\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. When presented with the question involving a colorful pebble and a goldfish, a person with common sense would deduce that the most likely place for these two objects to come into contact would be in an environment that typically houses both elements. 1. Compatibility with the Goldfish's natural habitat: Goldfish are aquatic creatures that typically live in freshwater environments. An aquarium is specifically designed to house water-dwelling creatures like fish, providing a controlled and well-maintained ecosystem. It is a suitable environment where a goldfish can survive and thrive, making it a reasonable answer that aligns with human common sense. 2. Commonly used to house pet goldfish: Many people around the world keep goldfish as pets, and often they are housed in aquariums within their homes. Aquariums are a popular choice for displaying and caring for fish, as they provide the necessary conditions such as clean water, aeration, temperature control, and other essential factors that ensure the well-being of these aquatic pets. 3. Frequent presence of pebbles in aquariums: Aquariums often contain pebbles and other colorful substrates to enhance their visual appeal and create a more natural habitat for the fish. Pebbles serve as both a decorative feature and a functional element in the aquarium, providing shelter for the fish and contributing to the maintenance of healthy water conditions. 4. Limited likelihood of other options: When compared to the other possible answers – creek, pet store, playground, and pond – the probability of a colorful pebble falling on a goldfish is highest within an aquarium. While goldfish can exist in creeks and ponds, these natural environments tend to contain less colorful pebbles, and the likelihood of one specifically falling on a goldfish is much lower. In a pet store, a goldfish would more likely be housed in aquariums or tanks similar to those found in homes, still making \\"aquarium\\" a logical answer. Lastly, a playground does not typically feature either goldfish or pebbles in a manner that would result in the given scenario. Considering these factors, the answer \\"aquarium\\" is aligned with human common sense since it represents a familiar, controlled environment suitable for housing both goldfish and colorful pebbles, and it takes into account the natural habitat of these creatures, the common pet owner's practice of keeping goldfish in aquariums, and the relative likelihood of the scenario unfolding when compared to the other options provided."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state. “We disagreed on things,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement. “I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,” Trump said. “We were really not thinking the same.” Trump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship. Tillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein. The move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings. “It’s all very Trumpian,” said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump’s transition team. “When the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.” During his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public. The animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a “moron” following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account. Tillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia — including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain. In return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. When Trump ultimately made his decision last week to... According to the above context, answer the following question. When did Tillerson learn of his termination?

So, in our question, it indicates a negative opinion about the movie, not positive. Thus, the correct answer is 'negative'.  The other option 'positive' is incorrect because words like 'uneventful' usually aren't used to give compliments or show that we like something.

For the first batch of batter, add a few drops of red food coloring or edible gel paste to the bowl and stir with a clean spoon until the color is fully incorporated. Add more color as necessary to achieve the desired intensity. Repeat with the blue and yellow food coloring.  You can actually use any colors you like for tie-dye cupcakes, and can also use more than just three colors. Be sure to use a fresh bowl and a fresh spoon for each batch of colored batter, otherwise the colors will become muddy. You can also mix and match food coloring to achieve different colors. For instance, you can mix blue and red to achieve purple. To have white in your mix, leave one of the bowls of batter uncolored. Prepare a cupcake tin by lining it with white cupcake liners. Into the bottom of each liner, drop 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of red batter. Then place one or two spoons of yellow batter on top of that, followed by an equal quantity of blue batter on top. Stop when the liners are filled half way.  You can layer the colors in any way you like, and don’t have to use the red, yellow, blue pattern. different spoons for each color. If you're using more colors, use ½ to 1 tablespoon (7.5 to 15 ml) of batter for each color. Instead of spooning the colors into the liners, you can also transfer each batter color to a separate pastry bag, and pipe in the batters one color at a time. To create the tie-dye effect, take a clean toothpick and gently swirl around the batter in each liner. Don’t mix too much, or you will end up blending the colors and they’ll become muddy.  You can create circular tie-dye patterns by swirling the toothpick in circles. Create wavy patterns by zig zagging the toothpick in the batter. Make tie-dye spikes by dipping the toothpick into the batter in a few places and pulling it straight out. This will lift the bottom batter colors to the top.","output":"Create tie-dye cupcakes by dividing batter into separate bowls, adding different food coloring to each, layering the colored batter in cupcake liners, and swirling with a toothpick for a tie-dye effect."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

In 1933, a child orphaned during the Ukrainian Holodomor runs away from his orphanage and is taken in by a Red Army unit and adopted by its kindly commander, who gives him the name Leo Demidov. In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo  becomes an icon across the Soviet Union when he is photographed planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag during the Battle of Berlin. He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters. Angry, Leo strikes Vasili, who harbours growing resentment against Leo and the other officer in the unit, Alexei Andreyev; all three were in Berlin together in 1945. Vasili is in charge of Brodsky's interrogation and execution, and one of the names he gives to their superior, Major Kuzmin, is that of Raisa, a primary school teacher, several of whose colleagues have recently been arrested for dissident views. Kuzmin orders Leo to investigate his own wife. Meanwhile, Alexei's young son, Jora, is found dead near a railway yard.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Although Questions 1 and 2 are related, they are not exactly the same. Let's break down the nuances of these questions. Question 1: \\"How do one feel happy when one is lonely?\\" This question is focused on understanding how an individual can gain a sense of happiness while experiencing loneliness. It targets the strategies and mechanisms that may help in overcoming the feelings of loneliness and moving towards a happier state of mind. Question 2: \\"What's a happy thing to do when you feel sad and lonely?\\" This question is more action-oriented by asking for specific activities or actions that can be taken to immediately improve one's mood when they feel both sad and lonely. It implies that a quick fix may be in the form of a single action, as opposed to a broader state of mind. Though similar, these questions ask for different kinds of responses. Here's a detailed answer for each question: Question 1: How do one feel happy when one is lonely? Finding happiness while being lonely can be achieved through multiple approaches: 1. Self-reflection: Take the opportunity to explore your thoughts and emotions and gain a better understanding of yourself. Use this time for introspection and personal growth. 2. Develop hobbies: Engaging in hobbies or learning new skills can give you a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment, making you feel happier even when you are alone. 3. Connect with nature: Spending time outdoors, going for a walk, or simply sitting in a park can help you feel a sense of connectedness to the world, which can combat feelings of loneliness. 4. Practice gratitude: Focus on the positive aspects of your life and what you are thankful for. Keeping a gratitude journal or mentally listing the things you are grateful for can help shift your mindset toward a happier one. 5. Maintain a routine: Creating a daily routine can provide structure and purpose in your life, even when you're feeling lonely. 6. Mindfulness and meditation: These practices can help you become more present in the moment, gain a sense of inner peace, and alleviate feelings of loneliness. Question 2: What's a happy thing to do when you feel sad and lonely? Here are some activities you can engage in when you feel sad and lonely: 1. Reach out to a friend or family member: Sometimes, a simple conversation can remind you that you aren't alone, and your loved ones are always there to support you. 2. Watch a funny movie or TV show: Laughter is a natural mood booster. Watching something funny can help take your mind off your feelings of sadness and loneliness. 3. Engage in physical activity: Exercise releases endorphins, which can help improve your mood. Going for a walk, run, or participating in a group exercise class can be a great way to lift your spirits. 4. Listen to uplifting music: Music has a powerful effect on our emotions. Create a playlist of your favorite feel-good songs and listen to it when you're feeling down. 5. Volunteer or help someone in need: Acts of kindness and generosity can boost your happiness level and reduce feelings of loneliness. Find a local organization where you can volunteer, or simply offer help to a friend, family member, or neighbor. 6. Engage in creative pursuits: Painting, writing, cooking, or playing a musical instrument can serve as an outlet for your emotions and provide you with a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. In conclusion, while both questions are related to dealing with loneliness, they focus on different aspects. Question 1 asks how individuals can feel happy despite feelings of loneliness, whereas question 2 seeks specific activities to create happiness when experiencing sadness and loneliness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Conserving resources has a positive impact on the environment, and recycling conserves natural resources. Given these facts, what has a positive impact on the environment among the following options: - patch reefs  - coral  - animals  - recycling  - power  - ferns  - bushes  - Green beans A:","output":"Recycling has a positive impact on the environment among the given options. While patch reefs, coral, animals, ferns, bushes, and green beans all play crucial roles in ecosystem function and biodiversity, they are not actions that directly contribute to the conservation of resources. On the other hand, recycling is a human action that serves to conserve natural resources and reduce negative impacts on the environment. To understand the positive environmental impact of recycling, let us examine some of its benefits: 1. Reduction of Waste: Recycling helps to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and incinerators. Landfills contribute to environmental degradation and release toxic chemicals into the soil and air, while incinerators produce harmful emissions and toxic ash. By repurposing waste materials into new products, recycling helps limit these detrimental effects on the environment. 2. Conservation of Natural Resources: Recycling allows for the efficient use of limited resources and reduces the demand for extracting raw materials. For example, recycling paper reduces the need to cut down trees and conserves forests, which in turn benefits the numerous species that rely on them for habitat. Additionally, the recycling of metals, such as aluminum and steel, reduces the need for mining and the associated environmental damage. 3. Energy Efficiency: The production of new goods using recycled materials requires less energy than producing goods from virgin materials. Recycling aluminum cans, for example, is estimated to save up to 95% of the energy needed to produce new cans from raw materials. Not only does this conserve resources, but it also decreases greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy production. 4. Reduction of Pollution: The use of recycled materials in production often results in lower emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and water pollutants compared to using raw materials. Additionally, recycling can help prevent hazardous waste, such as electronic components, from ending up in landfills and polluting the environment. 5. Sustainable Development: Recycling supports sustainable development by encouraging the responsible management of resources, increasing resource efficiency, and fostering the principle of a circular economy, in which materials are continuously cycled through economic processes rather than being simply discarded after only one use. In conclusion, recycling is the option among those listed that has a positive impact on the environment. Through the reduction of waste, conservation of natural resources, improved energy efficiency, reduced pollution, and promotion of sustainable development, recycling serves to lessen the burden on ecosystems and help protect the Earth for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Jason and the Argonauts Movie plot: Pelias (Douglas Wilmer), misinterpreting the prophecy given to him by the god Zeus (Niall MacGinnis), usurps the throne of Thessaly, killing King Aristo and most of his family. The infant Jason is spirited away by one of Aristo's soldiers. Pelias slays one of the king's daughters, Briseis (Davina Taylor), as she seeks sanctuary in the temple of the goddess Hera (Honor Blackman). Because the murder has profaned her temple, the angry Hera becomes Jason's protector. She warns Pelias to beware \\"of a man wearing one sandal\\". Twenty years later, Jason (Todd Armstrong) saves Pelias from drowning (orchestrated by Hera), but loses his sandal in the river; Pelias recognizes him from the prophecy. Learning that Jason intends to find the legendary Golden Fleece, he encourages him, hoping Jason will be killed in the attempt. Jason is brought to Mount Olympus to speak with Zeus and Hera. Hera tells him Zeus has decreed he can only call upon her for aid five times. She directs him to search for the Fleece in the land of Colchis. Zeus offers his direct aid, but Jason declares he can organize the voyage, build a ship, and collect a crew of the bravest men in all Greece. Men from all over Greece compete for the honor. Because their ship is named the Argo after her builder, Argus (Laurence Naismith), the crew are dubbed the Argonauts. Among them are Hercules (Nigel Green), Hylas (John Cairney), and Acastus (Gary Raymond), the son of Pelias, sent by his father to sabotage the voyage. Hera guides Jason to the Isle of Bronze, but warns him to take nothing but provisions. However, Hercules steals a brooch pin the size of a javelin from a treasure building, surmounted by a gigantic statue of Talos, which comes to life and attacks the Argonauts. Jason again turns to Hera, who tells him to open a large plug on Talos' heel, to release the giant's ichor. Talos falls to the ground, crushing Hylas, hiding his body.

Flashbacks reveal that his wife (Salli Richardson) and daughter (Willow Smith) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced quarantine of the island in 2009, when Neville stayed behind on the island as military personnel. Neville's only mitigation for his loneliness is his German Shepherd named Samantha, a.k.a. Sam (given to him by his daughter as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts.

Summarize the following: To make this traditional Jamaican treat, you only need a few simple ingredients:  2 brown coconuts 1 cup of fresh ginger, diced 2 cups of golden brown sugar, packed 3 cups of water Take your fresh brown coconuts and use a screwdriver to poke holes through the eyes of the nut. Drain the coconut water from the center of the coconuts -- use or discard as you wish!  Use a hammer to crack the coconuts open and use a butter knife to pry the coconut meat from the shell. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the brown outer layer from the meat, then use a knife to dice the coconut.  Tip: You can make it easier to remove the coconut meat from the shell by baking the drained coconut in a 400 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Allow the coconut to become cool to the touch before cracking with the hammer. Combine the diced coconut, diced ginger, brown sugar and water in a heavy bottomed-saucepan and place over a medium heat. Stir the mixture continuously with a large spoon until it boils and the sugar starts to caramelize. Keep stirring as the mixture thickens to prevent the sugar from sticking to bottom and sides of the saucepan. Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature -- you want it to reach approximately 295 °F (146 °C). Once the sugar has caramelized nicely and the mixture becomes very difficult to stir, turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Working quickly, spoon drops of the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper, using about two tablespoons of mixture per coconut drop. Allow the drops to cool and harden before eating.

And the answer is?","output":"The comic hero created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939 is Batman. Batman is one of the most iconic and enduring characters in the world of comic books and beyond. Batman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. It was in this issue that readers were first introduced to the wealthy Bruce Wayne, who by night turns into Batman, a compelling crime fighter. The co-creators of Batman are Bob Kane and Bill Finger. Bob Kane was an American comic book writer and artist most famously known for co-creating Batman and several of the superhero’s iconic villains. He was born as Robert Kahn on October 24, 1915, in New York City. In contrast, Bill Finger was born on February 8, 1914, and he, too, was a native of New York. Bill Finger was initially brought in by Kane to help add to the initial design of the character, which Kane had begun. Finger played a significant role in adding several iconic elements to the character of Batman, including his dark look, the city of Gotham, and the character’s lack of superpowers. What started as a mere comic book endeavor quickly snowballed into a phenomenon. This is because Batman as a character connected with readers in ways that few characters had before. He was human, had no superpowers, and battled inner demons, even as he fought off crime in Gotham City. This element of depth made Batman a beloved hero among readers and continued to appeal to subsequent generations, ensuring his survival and popularity. Over the years, Batman has evolved and taken on many shapes and forms, both in the comic book pages and on screen. The character has been featured in multiple television shows, films, video games, and other media, gaining global recognization. Despite the vast array of interpretations, the core essence of Batman, the superhero who straddles the line between light and dark, upholds justice, fights crime and represents human resilience, remains the same. The character continues to be celebrated and remains alive in the hearts of youngsters and adults alike, seven decades after he was first introduced by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.

Article:","output":"Title: Youth Football Coach Sentenced to 15 Years for Horrific Sexual Offenses Youth football coach, Andrew Faulds, age 40, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty of a series of harrowing sex offenses, including the rape of a 13-year-old girl with severe learning difficulties. The long-standing children's worker, whose despicable actions have left a lasting impact on his victims and their families, was caught and subsequently arrested after a video of the evil act was discovered on his mobile phone. The horrifying discovery was made by police officers who were executing a search warrant at Faulds' residence. In addition to the video evidence, the officers also found hundreds of indecent images of children on Faulds' laptop. Faulds admitted to the string of sex offenses, including the rape of the young girl, after his arrest, leading to his eventual conviction and sentencing. The severe consequences of Faulds' actions extend far beyond his own personal punishment and have a profound effect on his young victims, their families and the community as a whole. The trust placed in Faulds as a football coach and as a mentor to children was shattered by his heinous crimes and serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers that lurk in every corner of society. As a youth football coach and children's worker, Faulds was skillfully positioned at the heart of his community and manipulated his role to gain access to vulnerable children whom he would later betray. While parents and guardians placed their faith in the man responsible for nurturing and guiding their children, Faulds used his opportunity to commit unspeakable acts that have marred both the lives of his victims and their families forever. The long-lasting impact of Faulds' sex offenses will undoubtedly leave a dark shadow in the community where he once held a role of responsibility and trust. As society grapples with the realization that such sinister acts can be carried out by those you least expect, it is essential for parents, guardians, and community members to remain vigilant in their interactions with authority figures. Mandatory background checks and thorough monitoring procedures should be implemented by organizations and institutions that cater to children. Implementing safer recruitment practices and offering continuous training to staff on safeguarding children will create a more secure environment for young people now and in the future. While it may not be possible to predict or prevent every potential threat, it is of the utmost importance to take measured, reasonable precautions to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. In conclusion, the conviction and sentencing of Andrew Faulds serve as a sobering reminder of the hidden dangers that can exist in the most trusted of roles. As a society, we must work diligently to safeguard our children, ensuring that those who prey on the vulnerable are brought to justice. Let Faulds' 15-year sentence serve as a much-needed wake-up call to communities everywhere, inspiring them to remain vigilant in their quests to protect the innocent and vulnerable from the wicked and depraved individuals hidden among us."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But on the whole, the plot is very clichéd, as is its seeming message. If you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing.

If you want to be grossed out, or tell your friends about a really messed up film, then this is for you. What is the sentiment of this review? pick from the following.  A). negative;  B). positive;","output":"A). negative;  The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer points out several flaws in the film they viewed. They criticized the plot as 'very clichéd' and the message as seeming unoriginal. Although they acknowledge that the visual elements of the film were impressive and there were some enjoyable comedic moments, the overall tone of the comments is negative. Words like 'grinding', 'unpleasant to sit through', and indicating that it failed to be 'disturbing' (which was their initial pursuit) convey a clear dissatisfaction with the movie. The suggestion to 'steer away' from the movie if looking for a more 'high-brow' experience and the recommendation to watch another film ('The Lost') if one seeks a challenging film also demonstrate a negative sentiment. Furthermore, the recommendation they give for people who want to 'be grossed out' or talk about a 'messed up film', suggest that the movie did not meet the intellectual or aesthetic standards of this reviewer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Among the alleged targets: Sens. John McCain, Joe Lieberman, Jack Reed, Al Franken and Carl Levin; Rep. Steve Israel of the House Appropriations Committee -- and Adm.

Over a four-month period last year, a military cell devoted to what is known as \\"information operations\\" at Camp Eggers in Kabul was repeatedly pressured to target visiting senators and other VIPs who met with Caldwell. When the unit resisted the order, arguing that it violated U.S. laws prohibiting the use of propaganda against American citizens, it was subjected to a campaign of retaliation. \\"My job in psy-ops is to play with people's heads, to get the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave,\\" says Lt.

It was really a pure process, and I think you hear that. \\"I Can't Stay\\" was one of the first things I worked on. When I sent it back to Rich, he was blown away by what I'd done over the guitar chords he'd given to me and it started the process between us. These songs really kind of wrote themselves. I can't describe it in any better way. I just had to get out of the way, really. CNN: Speaking of blessed, you explore spirituality on this album, especially on \\"Presence of God,\\" and have said that may make people uncomfortable. Sure, it's more direct than what Depeche Mode usually does, but was it really such a major departure? Gahan: Not at all. I think that's because Martin [Gore] and I shake from the same hip as well. In the past, especially in the \\"Violator\\" and \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" period, I felt like Martin was writing songs about me or for me. He wasn't really; I was younger then. But we had those same doubts, and quite often seemed to experience the same weird, dark sense of humor. \\"Presence of God\\" is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what's going on around you, you get answers to the questions you were asking. The title \\"The Light the Dead See\\" works so well because sometimes when you're still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen. It's when I'm trying to figure that out for myself that I get into all kinds of trouble. CNN: It's a delicate balance to explore these subjects in your lyrics and not alienate the audience by coming across as tortured or preachy. How did you manage to pull it off? Gahan: I'm glad you heard that. There was no torture at all. It really came easy, this stuff. For me, that doubt and that faith are so close. It's impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things. But it's not hokey in any way. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. It's purely my experience of feeling like I really belong, and then moments of really what the f--k am I doing? We all have that. I tried to keep that as open as possible without directing. I don't want to direct you. I want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts. CNN: The album is beautiful -- both melancholy and uplifting at the same time. How did you go about hitting those emotional nerves? Gahan: I think some of that stuff comes from the way I used my voice. I go to a very visual place when I'm singing. It's very cinematic and I get this feeling of space. I love when music does that. I listened to David Bowie a lot when I was a teenager. The place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that I wanted to go to. I didn't know if that place really existed, but I believed it did. I tried to capture that same magic again on this record. It's a place you go to when you listen, where you just feel a sense of belonging. Or, not feeling a sense of belonging and that being OK. CNN: Is there any one Bowie line, image or album that was able to transport you more than others? Gahan: There's many records that have been pivotal for me. If I were to name one, it would be \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\" It changed my life. The same thing happened when punk rock came along and I heard the Clash for the first time. I was 16 or 17 years old. It made me feel like I belonged to something. Music has always done that and continues to do that for me. Lately, a record that I bought that I'm really listening to a lot is the new Spiritualized album, \\"Sweet Heart Sweet Light.\\" There's a sense of humor to me in the combination of his words and his musical styles. It just spoke to me and brought a smile to my face. Some may listen to that record and not get the same feeling, but it's really uplifting and a beautiful record. CNN: You are currently recording your 13th Depeche Mode album. Can you give us a hint about what we can expect? Gahan: Martin's been particularly prolific, and myself as well. I was doing the Soulsavers thing and writing demos for Depeche Mode with a friend. Martin got on a writing streak. He's got some really great songs. We usually start a record with six or seven songs; we currently have about 20. In the studio, we're trying to not over-fuss things. We're trying to not over-produce the sound. If something's working, we're just recording it. We're trying to get the element of performance into the record more. We've already been talking to Anton Corbijn about some ideas we have about where we want to take the record visually and he usually has a pretty great angle. The songs have a bluesy influence. Obviously, it's not a blues record, but there's definitely some of those influences there. And it has a kind of soulful feel as well. It's still early so it's difficult to tell at this stage. We've been making records for a long time together, but there's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a Depeche Mode record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves.

Article:","output":"Title: Changes in England's Top Order and the Importance of Adapting During the World Cup A year ago, it would have been unthinkable to imagine Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, and Gary Ballance as England's top three in One-Day cricket. However, recent alterations in the line-up show that this format of the game is still not a priority for England's management. With the 2015 Cricket World Cup currently underway, England now face the challenge of maintaining a consistent top order to ensure success throughout the tournament. The late changes in England's ODI line-up reveal the team's lack of focus on one-day cricket. This could be attributed to an emphasis on Test cricket, which England is traditionally known for excelling in. However, this lack of priority has the potential to prove detrimental to England's performance during the Cricket World Cup. Despite the surprising inclusion of Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, and Gary Ballance in the top order, Ravi Bopara, a previous regular in the squad, cannot express disappointment as his recent performances have not been sound enough to secure him a spot. Bopara's current form does not warrant his inclusion in the top order, and the team must move forward without him. One of the concerns facing England's cricket team during the World Cup is the lack of diversity in their bowling attack. The current squad's bowling is relatively one-dimensional, featuring predominantly fast bowlers. This could prove problematic as opposing teams become used to the consistent pace. England must develop a Plan B in the event that their primary bowling strategy fails to deliver results. Captain Eoin Morgan will play a crucial role in guiding the team to adapt and succeed during the World Cup. Morgan must rely on his instincts and experience to make crucial decisions during matches. At times, this may mean going against conventional wisdom or established strategies. However, the ability to make such decisions is what sets successful captains apart from the rest. It is worth noting the impressive performances put forth by associate nations during the World Cup so far. Teams like Ireland, Afghanistan, and Scotland have shown that they have the potential to cause upsets against more established cricketing nations. England must not underestimate these opponents and should prepare thoroughly to avoid falling behind. With the tournament in full swing, England now has the opportunity to settle their top order and hone their strategies to ensure success in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. By acknowledging the importance of one-day cricket and adapting to various challenges that come their way, England's cricket team can pursue their ultimate goal of becoming world champions.

Solve -20 = 6*y + 10 for y.","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like a little story: We have this equation: -20 = 6*y + 10 1. Our goal is to find out what \\"y\\" is! 2. Let's look at the numbers. We have \\"10\\" on the right side of the equation and we want to get rid of it. To do that, we can do the opposite action. So, let's subtract 10 from both sides. Now, we get: -20 - 10 = 6*y 3. That gives us: -30 = 6*y 4. Now, we have \\"6*y,\\" which means 6 times y. To find out what \\"y\\" is, we're going to do the opposite action again. Instead of multiplying, we will divide both sides by 6. So, let's divide -30 by 6: -30 ÷ 6 = y 5. Finally, we get the answer: y = -5 So, the solution to the math problem is y = -5!

Michael Morse, Steve Lombardozzi, Danny Espinosa and Strasburg each had an RBI for the Nationals, winners in seven of their last 10. Tyler Clippard pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the ninth to secure the win for Washington. Emilio Bonifacio doubled and Greg Dobbs had a pair of hits for Miami, which has lost four of its last five. Ricky Nolasco (8-7) was pegged with the loss after giving up all four runs on six hits with two strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings. The Nationals scored a pair of two-out runs in the fifth. Espinosa reached on a fielder's choice, then moved to second when Roger Bernadina grounded out. Nolasco intentionally walked Jhonatan Solano to put runners at first and second for Strasburg, who singled to right to plate Espinosa. Lombardozzi followed with a single to bring Solano home. Washington tacked on two more in the sixth to take a 4-0 lead. Ryan Zimmerman and Adam LaRoche singled before the former scored on a Morse base hit.

This sentence explains how the payment is calculated: It is based on the difference between two values - (a) the hypothetical benefits the OASDHI trust funds would have paid to railroad workers and their families, assuming they were covered by OASDHI, and (b) the hypothetical payroll taxes the OASDHI trust funds would have received from railroad employment, assuming it was covered by OASDHI. This calculation is made to account for the fact that railroad workers and their families are not actually covered by OASDHI; however, the payment is intended to balance any financial disparities. Sentence 2: The payment is adjusted to reflect benefits and taxes. The second sentence states that the payment (previously mentioned in Sentence 1) is adjusted in order to account for any benefits and taxes. This is in line with the explanation provided in the first sentence, where the payment is calculated based on the difference between the hypothetical benefits and payroll taxes associated with railroad workers' coverage under OASDHI.

Q: Context: Recent randomized trials suggest that intensive glycaemic control fails to reduce heart failure-related events in patients with diabetes. The molecular cues underlying persistent myocardial damage despite normoglycaemia restoration remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, orchestrate transcriptional programs implicated in adverse cardiac remodelling. The present study investigates whether miRNAs participate to hyperglycaemic memory in the diabetic heart.', 'miRNA landscape was assessed by Mouse miRNome miRNA PCR Arrays in left ventricular specimens collected from 4-month-old streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, with or without intensive glycaemic control by slow-release insulin implants. A dysregulation of 316 out of 1008 total miRNAs was observed in the diabetic hearts when compared with controls. Of these, 209 were up-regulated and 107 were down-regulated by >2.0-fold. Interestingly enough, the expression of 268 of those miRNAs remained significantly altered in diabetic mice even after subsequent normoglycaemia. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that dysregulated miRNAs were implicated in myocardial signalling networks triggering apoptosis (miR-320b, miR-378, miR-34a), fibrosis (miR-125b, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-29b, miR30a), hypertrophic growth (miR-1, miR-150, miR-199a, miR-133a, miR-214, miR-29a, miR-125b, miR-221, miR-212), autophagy (miR-133a, miR-221, miR-212, miR30a), oxidative stress (miR-221, miR-146a, miR-34a, miR-210, miR-19b, miR-125b, miR27a, miR-155), and heart failure (miR-423, miR-499, miR-199a), respectively.

The comments came during a wide-ranging trade discussion Tuesday between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House.  The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.  Trump called the U.S.-South Korea deal \\"very, very bad\\" and \\"horrible.\\" He also said Canada has \\"treated us very, very unfairly.\\"  Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a so-called \\"232 report\\" to the White House, examining the national security impacts of steel and aluminum imports, and giving Trump 90 days to impose quotas or tariffs.  Under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can initiate a probe to determine if imports threaten national security.  \\"It's about our economy,\\" Vice President Mike Pence during the meeting. \\"It's about our national security.\\"  Trade was a major topic for Trump during the presidential campaign he vowed to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. After the trade discussion Trump is most likely doing what? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Still looking for a double edged sword - Still reading the 232 report - not enough information - Still considering imposing tariffs Answer:","output":"Still considering imposing tariffs"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: This article: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like \\"Society Pages\\" and \\"I'm a Beautiful... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar?, what is it ?

Summarize this article: Last week, the head of  exam watchdog Ofqual suggested some schools were making \\"strategic\\" use of challenges to A-level and GCSE grades. But the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said the \\"real issue is inaccurate marking\\". Ofqual has said it is planning improvements to the appeal process. The university sector's Supporting Professionalism in Admissions organisation has also called for \\"greater clarity\\" about the rising numbers of appeals and grades being changed. Director Janet Graham said: \\"This is an area that the awarding organisations and Ofqual could explore in more depth.\\" Ofqual chief Glenys Stacey faced questions last week from the Education Select Committee about the process of challenging exam results. Ms Stacey told MPs she wanted a system that was \\"swift, effective and fair\\". In the past four years, the number querying results has more than doubled to more than 400,000 and the number getting their grades changed after re-marking has also more than doubled to more than 77,000. But Chris King, Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) chairman and headmaster of Leicester Grammar School, said there needed to be much more transparency and information about the grades being challenged and changed. He also criticised the suggestion the increase in appeals was being driven by schools gaming the system to improve their grades \\"It is misleading to imply that schools who appeal wrong grades are actually a cause of the problem. This is a smokescreen,\\" said Mr King. Instead he blamed \\"inconsistent marking and grading and a Byzantine appeals process, which Ofqual itself acknowledges is inadequate\\". \\"Any suggestion that schools of any kind are 'gaming' the appeals system is unfair and underserved,\\" said Mr King. Exam boards charge for re-marking, unless there is a grade changed, with schools and parents paying millions of pounds each year. \\"Independent schools submit proportionally more appeals but naturally state schools put in far more than we do, and we welcome this. Ultimately this is about justice for hard working pupils, whatever school they go to,\\" said Mr King. Ofqual has said that only about 1% of the overall exam results are subsequently changed and that proposals to improve the process of appealing against GCSE and A-level results would be announced later this month.","output":"Recently, the number of schools challenging exam grades went up and the head of exam watchdog Ofqual thinks some schools are using this as a way to get better grades. But the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said the real problem is that the grades are not being marked correctly. Ofqual is working on making the process for challenging exam grades better, and a university group also wants more information about why there are more challenges and grade changes.

A:","output":"A: Yes, this product review is indeed negative. The reviewer has expressed disappointment in the movie \\"The Road to Christmas\\" due to the use of foul language and presence of LGBTQ+ content. They feel that these elements are not suitable for a Christmas movie and blame Hollywood for spoiling the overall experience. The review's tone can be interpreted as negative through various points. First, the opening statement directly states \\"very disappointed,\\" clearly highlighting the dissatisfaction the reviewer experienced. Second, the reviewer is highly critical of the inclusion of foul language and gay characters, which they believe do not belong in a Christmas movie. This disapproval further emphasizes the negative nature of their review. Additionally, the reviewer holds Hollywood responsible for tarnishing the experience, implying that the movie industry has a negative impact on the quality and content of the film. This statement not only reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the review, but it also expands the criticism to include the broader film industry.

They massacre the ranch hands and kidnap Little Jake, the grandson, leaving a ransom note and heading back for Mexico, where they have been hiding out. Martha, the head of the family, is offered the help of both the army and the Texas Rangers in hunting the gang.

Then his son Michael rides up on a motorcycle, bringing word that he has seen the kidnappers in the Chilicothe Canyon. The Texas Ranger captain is present and offers the services of his men, equipped with three REO touring cars. They, however, are ambushed and their cars put out of action. Jake, preferring the old ways, has followed on horseback, accompanied by an old Apache associate, Sam Sharpnose. He is now joined by his sons, Michael and James, with whom his relations are tense because of his desertion of the family ten years before.

The Redskins brought back Joe Gibbs, the man who led them to three Super Bowls before leaving to make a dent in NASCAR. Options: (a). World (b). Sports (c). Business (d). Science/Tech","output":"(b). Sports The topic of discussion is centered on the sports industry, specifically on the NFL team, the Redskins, and their decision to bring back their former coach, Joe Gibbs. The NFC East is a division in the National Football League (NFL), consisting of four teams: the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Eagles, and the Washington Redskins. The statement focuses on the efforts to resurrect the success of the Redskins in the NFL by re-hiring their celebrated coach, Gibbs. Joe Gibbs is a legendary figure in both the sports and automotive racing industries. He made a name for himself as the head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1981 to 1992, leading the team to three Super Bowl victories during his tenure (Super Bowl XVII, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXVI). Following his successful coaching career, he shifted gears to pursue his passion for motor racing and founded Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992. The NASCAR team went on to achieve considerable success, securing multiple championships under his leadership. Recognizing the need to rebuild the Redskins’ once-revered NFC East team, the organization decided to tap into its storied past by bringing Joe Gibbs back into the fold as the head coach. The Redskins hoped that reinstating Gibbs would reignite the same winning spirit that helped the team achieve its previous glories during his leadership.  This decision highlights the importance of a solid coaching foundation in the sports industry, as experienced coaches play a crucial role in honing the skills of athletes and developing strategies that can lead to success on the field. The narrative around Joe Gibbs’ return to the Redskins also showcases the cyclical nature of the sports business, where revered figures are often called upon to help revive the fortunes of struggling teams. In conclusion, the topic of discussion is primarily about the sports industry, and more specifically, the coaching decisions within an NFL team. The story of the Redskins bringing back Joe Gibbs as their head coach sheds light on the role of coaching and the impact it can have on a sports team. The return of Gibbs represents hope for a brighter future for the once-prominent NFC East team, as they aim to reclaim their former glory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Stiklestad  in 1030 is one of the most famous battles in the history of Norway. In this battle, King Olaf II of Norway  was killed. During the pontificate of Pope Alexander III, the Roman Catholic Church  declared Olaf a saint in 1164. His younger half-brother, Harald Hardrada, was also present at the battle. Harald was only fifteen when the battle of Stiklestad took place. He became King of Norway in 1047, only to die in a failed invasion of England at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066. The authenticity of the battle as a historical event is subject to question. Contemporary sources say the king was murdered. According to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle of 1030, Olaf was killed by his own people. Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070 that Olaf was killed in an ambush, and so did Florence of Worcester in 1100. Those are the only contemporary sources that mention the death of the king. After the king's canonization it was felt that the saint could not have died in such circumstances.  The story of the Battle of Stiklestad as we know it gradually developed during the two centuries following the death of King Olaf. Saint Olaf must have fallen in a major battle for Christianity.

Transmitted to Earth on Dec. 24, this image from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) extends New Horizons’ highest-resolution views of Pluto to the very center of Sputnik Planum, the informally named icy plain that forms the left side of Pluto’s “heart” feature.      Sputnik Planum is at a lower elevation than most of the surrounding area by a couple of miles, but is not completely flat. Its surface is separated into cells or polygons 10 to 25 miles wide, and when viewed at low sun angles (with visible shadows) the cells are seen to have slightly raised centers and ridged margins, with about 100 yards of overall height variation.      Mission scientists believe the pattern of the cells stems from the slow thermal convection of the nitrogen-dominated ices that fill Sputnik Planum. A reservoir that’s likely several miles or kilometers deep in some places, the solid nitrogen is warmed at depth by Pluto’s modest internal heat, becomes buoyant and rises up in great blobs, and then cools off and sinks again to renew the cycle.      “This part of Pluto is acting like a lava lamp,” said William McKinnon, deputy lead of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team, from Washington University in St. Louis, “if you can imagine a lava lamp as wide as, and even deeper than, Hudson Bay.”      Computer models by the New Horizons team show that these blobs of overturning solid nitrogen can slowly evolve and merge over millions of years. The ridged margins, which mark where cooled nitrogen ice sinks back down, can be pinched off and abandoned. The “X” feature is likely one of these – a former quadruple junction where four convection cells met. Numerous, active triple junctions can be seen elsewhere in the LORRI mosaic. |||||             Click through our slideshow to see more awesome photos of the Plutonium surface, beamed back in recent months by the New Horizons space probe.

The subject is Dean Bridge, which carries the main road over the water. 2. Thomas Telford, a well-known civil engineer from Scotland, designed and built the bridge. Now, let's dissect the hypothesis: 1. The subject is still the Dean Bridge. 2. It asserts that the designer of the bridge was one of the best civil engineers in Scotland. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that they both mention the same subject - the Dean Bridge. The main difference comes in how they describe the designer, who is identified as Thomas Telford in the premise and as one of the best civil engineers in Scotland in the hypothesis. However, the premise also describes Thomas Telford as \\"one of Scotland's greatest civil engineers.\\" This description implies that Telford holds a high level of expertise and has made significant contributions to the field of civil engineering in Scotland. As a result, it is reasonable to infer that the level of Telford's skill or reputation places him among the best civil engineers in Scotland. By connecting these pieces of information from the premise, we can deduce that it does entail the hypothesis that \\"The bridge was designed by one of the best civil engineers in Scotland.\\" The premise provides evidence that supports the classification of Thomas Telford as one of the best civil engineers in Scotland, and it directly states that he was the designer and builder of Dean Bridge. Hence, we can conclude that if the premise is true, it reasonably supports and entails the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\"  Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston?\\" is \\"Charleston LLC\\"?

Can you tell me the answer to when did charles dickens start his writing career??","output":"Charles Dickens, a highly acclaimed and celebrated English writer, began his writing career in the early 1830s. Born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England, Dickens faced financial struggles and hardships as a child. These life experiences would serve as an inspiration for his future works. His initial career in writing started when he began contributing to various newspapers and magazines. Around 1833, Dickens published his first story, \\"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\\" (later known as \\"Mr. Minns and His Cousin\\"), in the Monthly Magazine, a leading London periodical at the time. This marked the beginnings of his career as a writer. In 1834, he began working as a parliamentary reporter at the Morning Chronicle, covering political debates and news from the British Parliament. He also continued to contribute to various magazines, honing his skills in writing, storytelling, and social observation. However, it wasn't until the early 1830s that Charles Dickens started to gain widespread recognition and success in his writing career. His first major literary breakthrough came with the publication of his serialized work titled \\"Sketches by Boz\\" (1836) in the Evening Chronicle newspaper. \\"Sketches by Boz\\" is a collection of short stories and essay-like pieces offering detailed observations and comical insights into London life during the Victorian era. The same year, he also published his first novel, \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" (1836-1837), using the pen name \\"Boz.\\" The serialized format of this novel, along with its humor, well-drawn characters, and engaging plot, propelled Dickens to fame, and it quickly became a publishing phenomenon. From this point onwards, Dickens's writing career took off, and he went on to create highly regarded literary masterpieces such as \\"Oliver Twist\\" (1837-1839), \\"Great Expectations\\" (1860-1861), \\"A Christmas Carol\\" (1843), and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" (1859), among many others. Throughout his career, Dickens continued to use his works as a medium to expose social injustice, advocate for structural reforms, and generate empathy for the conditions of the poor, making him not just an exceptional writer but also an influential social reformer. His writing career spanned approximately 34 years until his death on June 9, 1870."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: \\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything.\\" He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, \\"My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love.\\" Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.Elgar's principal composition in 1905 was the Introduction and Allegro for Strings, dedicated to Samuel Sanford, professor at Yale University.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Earthquakes may take place every day near a volcano. But before an eruption, the number and size of earthquakes increases. This is the result of magma pushing upward into the magma chamber. This motion causes stresses on neighboring rock to build up. Eventually the ground shakes. A continuous string of earthquakes may indicate that a volcano is about to erupt. Scientists use seismographs to record the length and strength of each earthquake.  Now, I have a new situation: Two neighboring cities are situated in a volcanic area with lots of earthquakes.

Answer this question please: Which city experiences more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up?","output":"Park City, which is situated near a very active volcano, experiences more motion causing stresses on neighboring rock to build up. This is because its proximity to the volcano makes it more susceptible to the effects of magma movement and increasing number and size of earthquakes before an eruption. Hill City, located 50 miles north, may still experience some earthquakes due to its presence in the volcanic area, but the effects are likely to be less pronounced than in Park City due to the greater distance from the active volcano."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Stool softeners should only be taken on your doctor's instruction. Your doctor can write a prescription for this medication for you to treat hemorrhoids or other bowel issues.","output":"Once you have the prescription in hand, head to your local pharmacy and get the prescribed stool softeners. Make sure to read the product labels and packaging for instructions and dosages, as different brands may vary in terms of dosage and duration of use. Before you begin taking the stool softeners, ensure that you adhere to certain precautions and guidelines. First, maintain adequate hydration by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, as this helps the medication work effectively. Report any allergies you have, and inform your healthcare provider about any other medications, vitamins, or supplements you might be taking, in order to avoid possible drug interactions or complications. Additionally, follow a well-balanced diet that is rich in fiber, which includes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, as this will not only make the stool softeners more effective, but also help regulate bowel movements naturally. Gradually ease into physical activities or light exercises, as this can further aid in regular bowel movements. When you are ready to take the stool softeners, make sure to follow the prescribed dosage, and do not exceed the recommended amount, as this may lead to unwanted side effects. Take the medication at the same time each day to maintain a consistent routine. Swallow the stool softener capsules or tablets whole, accompanied by a full glass of water; do not crush or chew them. If you have been prescribed a liquid stool softener, measure the dosage accurately, using the measuring cup provided or a calibrated medicine spoon for precision. One common side effect of stool softeners is mild abdominal cramping. If you experience this, it is usually temporary and should subside as your body adjusts to the medication. However, if the cramping persists or worsens, consult your doctor immediately. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, bloating, and gas, although these are relatively uncommon. If you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, immediately discontinue use and seek emergency medical attention. Remember that stool softeners are intended for short-term use only, as prolonged use may lead to dependency or hinder your body's natural ability to have bowel movements without assistance. Regularly schedule follow-up appointments with your doctor to assess your progress and determine when it may be appropriate to discontinue use of the stool softeners. Your healthcare provider will guide you through the most suitable plan of action according to your specific needs and medical history. Lastly, do not hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns while using the stool softeners, as they are committed to ensuring your well-being and comfort throughout the entire process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You’ll need your hair to be wet, but not soaked, for this process.  Use a spray bottle. If you don’t want to step into the shower, use a small spray bottle to dampen your hair. Wet your brush. Run the wet brush through your hair. This will help the mixture grab onto each strand. Before you apply the mixture to your hair, be sure to test some of it on your hand. If your skin has a reaction, don’t apply the mixture.  There is such a thing as a cinnamon allergy. Rub some of the cinnamon paste onto the back of your hand and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to make sure you don’t react. Cinnamon creates a warm tingle but shouldn’t burn; if you have a sensitive scalp, this treatment is not recommended. If it does burn, rinse immediately! This will be messy! Have a friend help you if you can. As an alternative, use an applicator brush instead of your hands, which will cut down on the mess.  Rub the mixture all over your hands. Apply thoroughly from root to tip. Be sure to use generous amounts of the mixture throughout your hair. If the mixture is too thick, add ¼ cup of water to it. If you have thick hair, split it into sections before you apply the mixture. Use hair clips to hold your hair out of the way until you're ready to apply the mixture to it. Be careful to keep the mixture off your neck, as it may irritate the skin there. Give the mixture time to lighten your hair while you sit back and relax.  Put your hair in a bun and cover it. You can use a shower cap to easily cover your hair. Leave the mixture in your hair for at least 2-4 hours. If possible, leave it overnight. Put a towel over your pillow. Even if you have a shower cap on, the mixture could make a big mess if you move in your sleep. Put a towel over your pillow to protect it. Be patient. Even though the honey is sticky, it’s the cinnamon that will give you the most difficulty when you’re cleaning the mixture from your hair.  Rinse your hair. Before trying to wash your hair, do your best to rinse the mixture out of it. Shampoo your hair. Once you’ve rinsed all that you can out of your hair, shampoo thoroughly. You may need to shampoo twice to get all of the cinnamon out. Unlike bleach, this mixture won’t create a drastic change. Since the mixture is good for your hair, you can repeat it as many times as you’d like without damage. Do this until you get your desired shade.  Lightening your hair with cinnamon is a gradual process. It will only subtly change the color of your hair with each use. It may take three to four applications before your hair becomes noticeably lighter.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Meet the hotshot daughter of Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek When Jeff Hornacek’s name was floated in May as the potential new coach of the Knicks, most stories focused on what the former Utah Jazz shooting guard would bring to the table. Namely, his gorgeous daughter, Abby. “I definitely noticed [the attention],” the 22-year-old tells The Post. “I won’t say I didn’t, but I am blessed to be in the same conversation as my dad. I was very flattered.” The leggy Hilary Duff look-alike hasn’t had much time to bask in the spotlight. After graduating from USC in May with a journalism degree, Hornacek, who grew up idolizing sportscasters Robin Roberts and Craig Sager, landed a hosting gig with digital network 120 Sports in Chicago. So in August, she packed her Los Angeles life into a U-Haul and flew to the Windy City while her parents drove the truck more than 30 hours to Chicago. “They are troupers. My family’s philosophy is ‘We’re not just going to hire a mover for you,’ ” she says. “They work hard and don’t take the easy way out.” Still, living in Chicago won’t stop her from cheering on the Knicks. On Oct. 29, when the team plays its home opener against the Memphis Grizzlies, she’ll be next to her mom, Stacy, in the Madison Square Garden stands. “I definitely want to come out to a lot of games,” says Hornacek, who hit the court at Life Time Athletic at Sky gym in Midtown for a photo shoot with The Post. Though she’s too diplomatic to name a favorite player, she told The Post in September, “I think the team they have right now is very well-balanced with veterans and young players. They have [Carmelo] Anthony, [Joakim] Noah, [Derrick] Rose, [Courtney] Lee — all [have] been through the playoff grind. That’s a great balance to the younger players like Kristaps [Porzingis], [Brandon] Jennings, Justin Holiday.” Another athlete has already claimed her heart, though. Hornacek is in a long-distance relationship with former USC quarterback Anthony Neyer, who still lives in Los Angeles. Her favorite date night? Dinner and games at Dave & Buster’s, the arcade sports bar chain. “I pride myself in being good at the Pop-A-Shot!” she says. Competition runs in the self-proclaimed tomboy’s blood. She played on the beach volleyball team at USC and participated in every extracurricular sport, sans swimming, while growing up in Arizona. She also kept up with her older brothers, Tyler and Ryan, on both the basketball court and pingpong tables. “They didn’t take it easy on me,” she recalls. “If somebody didn’t have a bloody nose, it wasn’t a real game.” The Hornacek genes may have given her sharp elbows, but she’s hoping to carve her own niche. “My dad has done such a great job with his own identity, [and] in that way, it helps me. My last name is associated with someone who is such a great person and a great dad and role model,” she says. “I don’t want to just be Jeff Hornacek’s daughter. I want to be known for my knowledge and my personality as much as anything else.” Photos: Eilon Paz; Stylist: Emma Pritchard/Goldteeth & Co; Hair: T.

Answer choices: - global warming  - Dehydration  - flooding  - distance  - climate  - erosion  - dry and hot  - depression The answer is:","output":"Climate The tilt of the Earth's rotational axis has a significant impact on the Earth's climate. This is because the tilt determines how much sunlight each part of the Earth receives during different times of the year.  In fact, the tilt is responsible for the occurrence of seasons. When the North Pole tilts towards the sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. When the South Pole tilts towards the sun, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere. None of the other choices are directly influenced by the Earth's axial tilt. Of course, aspects like global warming, flooding, erosion etc. can be indirectly related to climate, but they are more often caused by other factors like human activity, natural processes or events, etc.  Depression (if you're referring to the psychological condition) isn't triggered by the Earth's tilt. However, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression, can occur during certain seasons. This is more due to the lessened amount of daylight in winter months rather than the tilt of the Earth's axis itself.  Finally, \\"distance\\" doesn't make sense in the context of the Earth's tilt affecting it significantly. The tilt of Earth doesn't drastically change our distance from the Sun. That is governed by the elliptical nature of Earth's orbit. And the Earth's tilt does not lead directly to dehydration or a \\"dry and hot\\" condition as these are regulated by several factors like geographical location, weather patterns, etc.  In conclusion, out of the given choices, \\"climate\\" is the most directly influenced aspect by the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The story begins in England approximately two centuries after the Norman Conquest, or around 1300 A.D. Saxon scholar Walter of Gurnie is the illegitimate son of the Earl of Lessford and has been dispossessed of his inheritance by his father's Norman widow. After joining a group of Saxons who free hostages held by Lessford, Walter is forced into exile when he is recognized. Walter flees England, accompanied by his friend Tristram Griffen, a Saxon archer, and sets out to make his fortune in Cathay during the times of Pax Mongolica.  Walter seeks the patronage of Mongol warlord General Bayan of the Hundred Eyes and agrees to fight for him.  The \\"Black Rose\\" of the title is the beauteous Maryam, a half-English, half-Mongol girl who has escaped from the harem Bayan is escorting to China.  Disguised as a servant boy, she travels with Walter and Tristram in the caravan. Maryam loves Walter, but he is too interested in his adventure to pay her any attention. Tristram doesn't like all the killing and decides to get away. He takes Maryam with him because she wants to go to England. Bayan sends Walter on a mission to see the Sung Dynasty Empress of that part of China not yet under Mongol rule When he arrives he is told that he must stay in China as a \\"guest\\" for the rest of his life. Then he finds Tristram and Maryam had also been. captured and imprisoned. During this time, Walter realizes he loves Maryam. The three of them decide to escape. Tristram dies. The small boat in which Maryam is waiting for Walter in drifts away before Walter can catch her. Walter returns to England alone.  Walter is welcomed back by the Norman King Edward because of all the cultural and scientific knowledge (including gunpowder) he has brought back from China. The king knights Walter and grants him a coat of arms. Two Mongol emissaries from Bayan show up. They have brought the Black Rose to England to join Walter there. Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who is told that he must stay in China forever is Walter of Gurnie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase?  Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Answer:","output":"The friend who didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase is Andy.  This conclusion is based on the information provided that Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication. If we infer from the hint that \\"millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin\\", then it is reasonable to conclude that the medication Ben was prescribed was probably a statin, which is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Since the statin changes the levels of HMG-CoA reductase in the body, Ben would have had this enzyme's levels changed by taking his prescribed medication.  On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor and therefore would have not been prescribed any medication, therefore his levels of HMG-CoA reductase would not have been changed by a drug such as a statin. Thus, the correct answer would be Andy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him.  Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent.  By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast.  An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean. Who were some of this trade partners?","output":"Some of Vasco da Gama's trade partners were people in Africa and India, as well as others across the Indian Ocean. They traded things like gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory, and sub-Saharan slaves. The goal was to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around Africa, so they could trade spices between Europe and Asia too, which was a very profitable business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders?  Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.  Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...","output":"The last name of the person who led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders is not mentioned in the provided text.

Summarize the following: When it finally comes time to lay your carpet runner, it's best to start at the very top and work your way down. That way, you'll have gravity on your side, and it'll be much easier to cut any runoff carpet at the end. If you traced the carpet outline at the beginning of the project, it should be an easy matter of getting the carpet situation between the two as close as you can. Take care to press the carpet under the nose and tug the rest out to make sure you're getting just as much carpet as you need. Work down to the last step; when you're done, the carpet should be covering the expected ground, but the outline of the steps may not be fully visible. Make sure each step is as good as it can get before you move down to the next-- any mistake will cause a load of undue strain later on once the project is supposedly complete. A carpet knee-kicker will get the carpet planted firmly in areas that may be otherwise difficult to reach.  Place the front edge of your carpet knee-kicker on center of the runner about two inches from the riser and apply pressure until the carpet is locked in. They can be remarkably satisfying to use, and will give your stairs a much tighter look than if done without.   Lean on the front knob of the kicker with one hand, and use the other hand to keep the kicker's shaft level.  You can also use a carpet chisel. The dull edge helps tighten up corners and is easier to use on stairs or in tight quarters. As with previous steps, the last part of using the knee-kicker should be making sure you got the job done to your satisfaction. Without kicking in properly, you may have too much carpet or too little, and it'll require uprooting or even destroying the progress you've made. Before you move on, you should ensure that the carpet is being snagged by the tackless strip at the far end of the tread. If the tackless strips aren't properly clinging to the carpet, it could result in the carpet getting bumpy a few years down the road. Using a chisel or other thin tool, press the angle between the step's height and tread to make sure it's getting hooked in. At the bottom, there should be a little bit of runoff. From here, it's just a simple matter of cutting the excess carpet away with a carpet knife. Feel free to do what you will with the remainder of the carpet. Some people are quick to throw them out, while others like to find practical uses for them. Having a powerful stapler designed for home improvement is necessary to finish things off and get your carpet snug and perfect. When stapling, push stapler through the carpet pile and against the backing before pulling the trigger.  Staple on the underside of the step noses, and nearest the angle between the tread and height. Staple at three inch intervals for optimal stability. Alternatively, you can use carpet glue instead of staples. Make absolutely certain that the carpet is exactly where you want it to be before you staple. After you staple, it will be next to impossible to correct any mistakes. Summary:","output":"To lay a carpet runner, start at the top and work your way down. Ensure the carpet is properly positioned and pressed under the nose of each step. Use a carpet knee-kicker to firmly secure the carpet and a carpet chisel to tighten corners. Check that the carpet is snagged by the tackless strip at the far end of the tread.

The complexities did not shake the authorities from their original premise — that the 18-year-old suffered a violent attack at a playground near her home. The father said the teenagers entered the playground brandishing a gun, and that he ran off, the officials said. Two minutes later, he returned and threw a bottle at the teenagers, to try to drive them off, but they chased him again, the officials said. When he returned 12 minutes later with police officers, the assailants were gone and his daughter was there, half clothed.      When she was interviewed, the woman told investigators she was raped by at least one of the suspects, the officials said. She was forced to perform oral sex on two others, they said, citing her account, and all of the suspects touched her breasts.      “The initial report, that all five of them raped her, is not looking like it happened that way,” one of the officials said.      Two of the suspects said a third suspect had sex with the woman. That suspect said he was present, but was on the phone, “and when he finished the call his friends were gone,” one of the officials said.      The woman did not report seeing a gun and so far, the suspects have denied they had one. The father and daughter were heavily intoxicated during the attack, the official said.      The official said the father lost custody of his daughter when she was 2. She was raised in another state, “out West,” by an adoptive family, one of the officials said.      “She reconnected with him last summer,” the official said.      Detectives found what the police said was “distant video” of the woman and her father walking into the playground, where they went to drink together after buying beer nearby, around 9 p.m.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Throughout Monday, investigators were hunkered down at a police building in Brooklyn, questioning the four suspects, as their colleagues searched the streets for a fifth suspect, the police said. But they turned up no independent witnesses who had seen or heard any parts of the attack, the police said, and had not recovered a gun either.      The woman had several recent physical injuries, Stephen P. Davis, the department’s top spokesman, told reporters on Monday afternoon.      “She had cuts and bruises and abrasions which are consistent with being physically attacked,” he said.      But Mr. Davis said it could take seven to 10 days for the results of a rape test performed on the woman to be known. “She had injuries consistent with an assault,” he said, declining to go into additional detail about any injuries associated with a sexual assault or rape.      Two of the suspects, ages 14 and 15, were taken to a Brooklyn precinct station house by their mothers on Sunday, a day after the police released surveillance video of a group of young men entering a deli before the attack. The police found the video around 2 p.m. on Saturday. After the mothers saw the video on television, they went to the police, Mr. Davis said.      The authorities then picked up a 15-year-old suspect for questioning, also on Sunday. A fourth suspect, 17, turned himself in, “knowing that we were looking for him,” Mr. Davis said.      The deli surveillance video has proved to be the best clue in an otherwise arduous investigation. Detectives began canvassing the area for video on Friday. Besides the distant footage of the father and daughter walking together into the playground, near where they live, the police also found distant video of five figures leaving the playground around the time of the attack.

From there, he said, investigators “moved out” and eventually came up with the video from Zaida Deli and Grocery.      A clerk there, Feliz Santos, said the five young men had come in around 8:45 p.m. on Thursday and bought 50-cent plastic bottles of Big Burst Fruit Punch.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      About 30 minutes later, though, workers at that deli and another apparently turned the woman’s father away in succession.      At Zaida Deli and Grocery, the father said only, “Gimme the phone,” Mr. Santos recalled, adding that he did not explain why.      Mr. Santos said he refused the man because he had no idea what he wanted and because the shop needed the phone for business. The father then continued on down the block.      The father stopped at Gaston Deli, two blocks from the playground, and asked to use the phone, again without explaining why or even saying that he wanted to call the police, said Sammy, a clerk there. Sammy, who said he was busy with customers, told him no. He added that the father seemed drunk.      “How he look, how he act, how he sway,” Sammy said.      Silent security footage from Gaston Deli captures the roughly 70 seconds he spent inside. Wearing jeans and a black-and-red coat, the father stopped and stood in the middle of the store as he motioned to the clerk and spoke with two customers.      One of the customers handed him a phone, but grabbed it away before he could start dialing. The father appears to speak to the clerk, lean toward the customer, and then haltingly leave.      The father’s actions remained difficult to account for, but a picture emerged on Monday of the dark and difficult circumstances the woman had been living under. Neighbors at an apartment complex near Osborn Playground said that her father had been an alcoholic for years.      They said he did not supervise a young son who often played in the trash-strewn hallway outside the door of his apartment, leaving his older children to look after the boy. Clusters of empty 24-ounce cans of King Cobra malt liquor strewn in the hallway and stairwell had been left by him, they said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “He’s like that, a drunk, yes,” said Bertha Payne, 44, who lives next door. She said he often knocked to beg for dollar bills and cigarettes.      Ms. Payne described the daughter as a kind and quiet young woman.      When Ms. Payne asked the father on Sunday how he was doing, she said he seemed baffled by the question.      “He said, ‘I have no idea what they’re doing around here,’ ” referring to the scrum of reporters and police officers nearby at the playground, Ms. Payne recalled. “He said, ‘I didn’t do nothing.’ ”      Mayor Bill de Blasio was informed of the crime on Sunday, a spokesman, Peter Kadushin, said. A day later, the mayor said he believed there had been no delay in the police response. But after talking to the police, Mr. Kadushin said, the mayor made clear his dissatisfaction with the department’s notification of the area’s residents.      “The mayor now believes strongly that the local community should have been informed sooner and has instructed the N.Y.P.D. to notify communities more quickly moving forward, whenever appropriate,” Mr. Kadushin said.      The 17-year-old suspect will be charged as an adult, because New York is one of two states that requires people 16 and older to have their cases handled in adult criminal court. But prosecutors have some discretion in deciding whether the cases of the younger suspects go to Family Court or Criminal Court.      Under New York law, someone who is 14 or 15 will be tried as an adult if he is charged with any of a list of the most serious crimes, including first-degree rape. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"This is a story about a young woman who was attacked at a playground near her home by a group of people.

Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille . In the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does? The callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \\"do-se-do your partner\\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \\"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines. Although popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.

Is \\"In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean \\"those who serve in close attendance to the nobility\\", the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai.\\" the correct answer?","output":"Yes, the given statement is indeed accurate in explaining the origins and meaning of the term \\"samurai\\" in the Japanese context. However, to provide a more comprehensive analysis of samurai and their significance, we can delve deeper into the topic. In the Japanese language, samurai are often referred to as \\"bushi\\" (武士), which translates to \\"warrior.\\" They were a distinct class of skilled and highly trained warriors, primarily tasked with serving in close attendance to the nobility, particularly the feudal lords or \\"daimyōs.\\" The term \\"samurai\\" is derived from the Japanese verb \\"saburau,\\" which means \\"to serve\\" or \\"to attend.\\" Over time, the pronunciation of \\"saburau\\" evolved into \\"samurai,\\" and the term came to represent members of this elite class of military personnel. While the Japanese samurai were comparable to European knights in terms of social and military standing, there were distinctions in their respective roles and responsibilities. Unlike knights, samurai were bound by a strict code of conduct called \\"bushidō\\" (武士道), which emphasized loyalty, honor, and discipline. Bushidō dictated how samurai interacted with both their superiors and inferiors, as well as how they conducted themselves in combat and other aspects of life. This code of conduct was an integral part of samurai culture and reflected their unwavering dedication to their duties. The samurai class emerged during the Heian period (794-1185) and continued to play a pivotal role in the Japanese society until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Throughout this period, samurai served various regional daimyōs and emperors, participating in numerous conflicts, and evolving their martial arts and skills. Some of the samurai's most renowned accomplishments include the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate, which was Japan's first military regime, and the more well-known Edo period, during which samurai solidified their influence on Japanese culture in various ways, such as popularizing arts like tea ceremony, poetry, and Noh theatre. In conclusion, while the term \\"samurai\\" originated from the Japanese pronunciation of \\"saburai,\\" it is important to understand the broader context and implications of this term. Samurai were highly revered and skilled warriors who were integral to Japan's political and military history, and they continue to hold a cherished position within Japanese culture today. Their strict code of honor, unwavering loyalty, and dedication to their duties remain emblematic of samurai and their enduring influence on Japanese society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Question: In 2009, how many films were officially selected by the film festival that had selected the indie film Rossum appeared in that year? Passage 1:In 2006, Rossum appeared in Poseidon, Wolfgang Petersen's remake of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. She played Jennifer Ramsey, the daughter of Kurt Russell's character. Rossum described the character as being proactive and strong in all situations, rather than a damsel in distress. Rossum also appeared as Juliet Capulet in a 2006 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In early 2009, Rossum appeared in Dragonball Evolution. Her next big screen venture was the indie Dare which was an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. In November 2009, Rossum appeared in Broadway's 24 Hour Plays in which actors, writers, and directors collaborate to produce, and perform six one-act plays within 24 hours to benefit the Urban Arts Partnership. Rossum appeared in Warren Leight's \\"Daily Bread\\", directed by Lucie Tiberghien.  Passage 2:Born into a poor family in Linlithgowshire in Scotland, Bartholomew joined the Merchant Navy at a young age and became a highly experienced sailor, travelling to the Baltic Sea and the West Indies, working on hired merchant ships during campaigns against French islands there at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve.  Passage 3:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877–1878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of Râmnic, Buzău, Argeș, Roman, Huși and Lower Danube (Galați) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service. Therefore, at King Carol I's desire, Romania's Assembly of Deputies and the Senate voted in favour of the Law no.1750 on the construction of the Cathedral Church in Bucharest, promulgated by King Carol I on 5 June 1884.

The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \\"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.\\" A:","output":"Question: According to the study conducted by Dr. Brenda Todd from City University London on babies' toy preferences, which statement best describes the findings? A. Both baby girls and boys showed equal interest in dolls and cars, indicating that toy preferences are not biologically influenced. B.

She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists. In the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as completely eating their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisonerâs name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner nr. 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards.

Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today. Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time. Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture.

Title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota.

Title: Quigley Down Under Movie plot: Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an American cowboy and sharpshooter with a specially modified rifle with which he can shoot accurately at extraordinary distances. He answers a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with a special talent in long-distance shooting, using just four words, \\"M. Quigley 900 yards,\\" written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by several closely spaced bullet holes. When he arrives in Australia, he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him, who are trying to force \\"Crazy Cora\\" (Laura San Giacomo) onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive Aborigines. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his house. The aborigine manservant knocks Quigley over the head and Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the outback with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas. When her home was attacked by Comanches, she hid in the cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying.

Mutations are natural. Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions.  Question: \\"What is necessary to create the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring?\\" Answer: \\"Survival\\" Is this answer correct? Possible answers: (i) no (ii) yes...I think the answer is","output":"(ii) yes, the answer is correct. Indeed, survival is a crucial factor for organisms to have the opportunity to pass their traits on to their potential offspring. If an organism does not survive long enough to reproduce, its genes (including any mutations) will not be passed on to the next generation. In the context of evolution, this means that for an advantageous mutation, or any mutation for that matter, to proliferate within a population, the organisms carrying those mutations have to survive and reach reproductive age in order to pass those traits on to their offspring. These heritable traits, over time and successive generations, may become more common within a population if they provide a survival and/or reproductive advantage. This is known as natural selection, a crucial mechanism in the process of evolution. However, it is important to note that survival is not the only factor determining the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring. Other factors, such as reproductive success and mate selection, also play a significant role in the process. An individual may survive but not necessarily mate successfully, in which case its traits would still not be passed on to the next generation. In summary, survival is essential for creating the chance to pass traits on to potential offspring, but reproductive success and other factors are also vital components in determining how traits are passed on and how they spread within a population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the product due to the misleading appearance of the watch as presented in the advertisement. They initially believed that there would be a silver piece running down the middle of the leather band, which turned out to be the seam where the two leather pieces are joined together. The reviewer points out that this misrepresentation is a result of the deceptive advertising, which caused them to purchase the watch with false expectations. The disappointment and dissatisfaction conveyed by the reviewer could potentially deter potential buyers from purchasing the product or raise concerns about the credibility of the company and their advertising methods. Consequently, this negative review might influence prospective customers to look for alternative watches with similar features, but from more reliable and transparent brands. Moreover, the reviewer's mention of \\"misleading advertising\\" highlights the importance of accurately representing product features in advertisements. Customers should be aware of the product they are purchasing without any misrepresentation or dishonesty from the company.

Given the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\", is \\"ashamed of herself\\" a valid answer? The answer is:","output":"No, \\"ashamed of herself\\" would not be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\". From the context provided, we can infer that Tracy is dancing around the house because she is happy, excited, and proud of her accomplishment of being accepted into college. These are all positive emotions, which are in direct contradiction to feeling ashamed of oneself. \\"Ashamed of oneself\\" implies that a person has done something wrong, morally questionable, or embarrassing and they are experiencing negative emotions such as guilt, embarrassment, or self-disgust because of it. In the given scenario, there is no indication that Tracy has done anything that would warrant feeling ashamed of herself. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"How would Tracy feel after?\\" might be \\"excited,\\" \\"emotional,\\" \\"elated,\\" \\"proud,\\" or \\"overjoyed.\\" These emotions better align with the positive context provided in the description of Tracy's reaction to her college acceptance letter. Receiving a college acceptance letter is a significant milestone in a person's life, and the overwhelming emotions that accompany such a joyful event would not be connected to feeling ashamed of oneself.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A fighter pilot is a military aviator trained to engage in air-to-air combat while in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft. Fighter pilots undergo specialized training in aerial warfare and dogfighting (close range aerial combat). A fighter pilot with at least five air-to-air kills becomes known as an ace.  - The Distinguished Service Order (DSO) is a military decoration of the United Kingdom, and formerly of other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, awarded for meritorious or distinguished service by officers of the armed forces during wartime, typically in actual combat.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth), also known as simply The Commonwealth, is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that were mostly territories of the former British Empire. The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states, organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat and non-governmental organisations, organised through the Commonwealth Foundation.  - Air Vice Marshal Edgar James Kingston - McCloughry CB , CBE , DSO , DFC & Bar ( 10 September 1896 -- 15 November 1972 ) , born Edgar James McCloughry , was an Australian fighter pilot and flying ace of the First World War , and a senior commander in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War . He shot down 21 aircraft and military balloons during the former war , making him the 6th highest - scoring Australian ace . He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar as well as being Mentioned in Despatches . McCloughry joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1914 , and served as a military engineer in Egypt and France before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) in December 1916 . He graduated from flying training in August 1917 and was posted to 23 Squadron RFC on the Western Front . He was seriously injured in a crash shortly thereafter and , after recovering in hospital , was reassigned as a flight instructor . He was reassigned again in the summer of 1918 to the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) . He scored most of his victories there in the last few months of the war . McCloughry left the AFC in August 1919 and pursued a career as an engineer in the United Kingdom before joining the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in 1922 . He served there in a strategy - planning capacity through the Second World War . In 1940 , under the influence of Lord Beaverbrook , he circulated an series of anonymous memos which were highly critical of senior RAF figures ; in response , he was posted to South Africa , but the fallout continued and by the end of the year the Chief of the Air Staff and several other commanders had been replaced . He retired from the RAF in 1953 as an air vice marshal , and died in 1972 in Edinburgh .  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.  - A dogfight, or dog fight, is an aerial battle between fighter aircraft, conducted at close range. Dogfighting first appeared during World War I, shortly after the invention of the airplane. Until at least 1992, it was a component in every major war, despite beliefs after World War II that increasingly greater speeds and longer range weapons would make dogfighting obsolete. Modern terminology for air-to-air combat is air combat maneuvering (ACM), which refers to tactical situations requiring the use of individual basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) to attack or evade one or more opponents. This differs from aerial warfare, which deals with the strategy involved in planning and executing various missions.

She was a prominent figure in the televangelist community during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly as a part of the PTL Club television program where she worked alongside her then-husband, Jim Bakker. Tammy Faye Messner passed away on July 20, 2007, at the age of 65 after a long battle with cancer. She was initially diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, which later metastasized and spread to her lungs. Despite undergoing various treatments over the years, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, her health continued to decline. Towards the end of her life, Tammy Faye made several public appearances discussing her journey with cancer and her faith in the face of adversity. Her candidness and resilience were an inspiration to many people. In July 2007, shortly before her death, she made a final appearance on Larry King Live, where she discussed her health and spirituality.

The term is also loosely used to refer to less turbulent, but still agitated, flows.  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks.

Its source is in the Southern Alps and it flows north and northwest, passing the township of Whataroa on the eastern side before reaching the Tasman Sea just south of Abut Head. The river is fed by many tributaries, such as the Perth River, and is crossed by State Highway 6 on its route between Whataroa and Te Taho.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited.

While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa.

Usually they contain shallow water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals. A few animals also make their home in ponds, including both alligators and beavers. The type of life in a pond is generally determined by a combination of factors including water level regime (particularly depth and duration of flooding) and nutrient levels, but other factors may also be important, including presence or absence of shading by trees, presence or absence of streams, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - The Perth River is a river located in the Southern Alps in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in terrace icefields north of the Rangitata Divide and is joined by multiple tributaries, including a creek from Abel Lake. It features a number of rapids and passes through two gorges before meeting the Whataroa River. The river is largely inaccessible, but recently, an adventure tourism company has begun offering \\"heli-rafting\\" on the river: whitewater rafters are flown in by helicopter to raft the river. Kayakers have been flying (\\"heli-boating\\") up the Perth for a number of years. The normal rafting put in at Five-Finger stream gives a nice class III-IV run with one amazing gorge. By flying up to Scone Hut, the trip becomes one of the best IV-V runs on the coast. More recently paddlers have been flying or walking upstream of scone hut for some V-V+ excitement.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - In geography, temperate or tepid latitudes of Earth lie between the tropics and the polar regions. The temperatures in these regions are generally relatively moderate, rather than extremely hot or cold, and the changes between summer and winter are also usually moderate.  - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.  - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - Climate is the statistics of weather, usually over a 30-year interval. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.  - Abel Lake is a small lake in the Westland region of the South Island of New Zealand . It is located in the Southern Alps , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) east of Franz Josef and is fed by the Abel Glacier . A short stream links the lake with the Perth River .  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the foundation that donated to complete construction work at the college?  The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,...

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca.

The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate the police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.Following a mid-year tour of the United States, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting off the Kinks from the main market for rock music at the height of the British Invasion.

Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired.:217, 236 § 5 Eight-bit machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ Who had a blackout at the bar?

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons .  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle).   - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.  - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901  1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\".  - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families.  - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.  - Max Born (11 December 1882  5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902  31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications.  - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879  28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry.  - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy since 1951.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.  - The amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change over a single period (such as time or spatial period). There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the difference between the variable's extreme values. In older texts the phase is sometimes called the amplitude.  - Alternating current (AC), is an electric current which periodically reverses polarity, whereas direct current (DC, also dc) flows only in one direction with a single polarity either positive or negative. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations \\"AC\\" and \\"DC\\" are often used to mean simply \\"alternating\\" and \\"direct\\", as when they modify \\"current\\" or \\"voltage\\".  - Teleradio - Moldova is the state - owned national radio - TV broadcaster . It owns the TV channels Moldova 1 and TVMI and the radio channels Radio Moldova and Radio Moldova Internaional . TRM was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union on 1 January 1993 , under its former name Radioteleviziunea Nationala din Moldova ( RTNM ) .  - In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more directions. A metal wire is a common electrical conductor. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases.   - Moldova (or sometimes ), or Moldavia, officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south. The capital city is Chiinu.  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Radio Moldova (RM) is the first publicly funded radio broadcaster in Moldova.  - The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) is an alliance of public service media entities, established on 12 February 1950. As of 2015, the organisation comprises 73 active members in 56 countries, and 34 associate members from a further 20 countries. Most EU states are part of this organisation and therefore EBU has been subject to supranational legislation and regulation. It also hosted debates between candidates for the European Commission presidency for the 2014 parliamentary elections but is unrelated to the institution itself. It is best known for producing the Eurovision Song Contest. EBU is a member of the International Music Council.  - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.  - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - Moldova 1 is the national Moldovan television channel, operated by the national public broadcaster, TeleRadio-Moldova.  - The International Music Council (IMC) was created in 1949 as UNESCO's advisory body on matters of music. It is based at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, France, where it functions as an independent international non-governmental organization. Its primary aim is to facilitate the development and promotion of international music-making.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.

(Associated Press)      White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson speaks to reporters during the daily press briefing in the Brady press briefing room at the White House, in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's health (all times local):      4:20 p.m.      President Donald Trump asked that a cognitive test be included as part of his first physical exam.      Trump's physician — Navy doctor Ronny Jackson — says the president achieved a perfect score on the test, which was included in last Friday's medical checkup.      Jackson says Trump's 30 out of 30 score means there's no indication that Trump has any cognitive issues.      The doctor speculates that Trump requested the exam in an attempt to beat back the narrative of the past few weeks that he is mentally unfit for office.      Jackson describes Trump as \\"very sharp\\" and \\"very articulate when he speaks to me.\\"      The doctor says he's found \\"no reason whatsoever\\" to think the president has any issues with his thought process.      ___      4:15 p.m.      President Donald Trump performed \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening during his recent physical examination.      That's according to his White House physician, navy doctor Ronny Jackson.      The doctor says he had \\"absolutely no concerns\\" about the 71-year-old president's cognitive abilities, but performed the screening because Trump asked him to do it.      Jackson says Trump's overall health \\"is excellent.\\" Jackson is providing a more detailed readout Tuesday following Trump's first physical last Friday at the Walter Reed military hospital.      ___      4:10 p.m.      President Donald Trump's doctor says he's confident that Trump has a \\"very strong and a very probable possibility\\" of completing his presidency \\"with no medical issues.\\"      Navy doctor Ronny Jackson says his assessment is based on Trump's cardiac assessment.      Trump had his first physical last Friday. Jackson says Trump's heart exam was normal, with regular rhythm and no abnormal sounds.      Trump also has no heart disease and no family history of it.      Jackson says that based on the clinical information he has on Trump and his year of observing the president, \\"I feel very confident that he has a very strong and a very probable possibility of making it completely through his presidency with no medical issues.\\"      Trump took office at age 70, making him the oldest incoming U.S. president.      ___      4 p.m.      President Donald Trump's overall health \\"is excellent\\" and he did \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening.      That's according to his White House physician, Navy doctor Ronny Jackson.      Jackson is providing a more detailed readout Tuesday following Trump's first physical last Friday at the Walter Reed military hospital.      Jackson reports that the 6-foot-3 president weighed in at 239 pounds — three pounds heavier than he was in September 2016.      Trump's blood pressure was 122 over 74, and his total cholesterol was 223, which is higher than recommended.      Trump was 70 when he took office, making him the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office.      Jackson says Trump is healthy and should remain so for the remainder of his presidency.      ___      7:30 a.m.      A fuller readout of President Donald Trump's health following his first medical check-up is expected later Tuesday.      Trump's White House physician - Navy doctor Ronny Jackson - declared Trump to be in \\"excellent health\\" following last Friday's exam at the Walter Reed military hospital in Maryland.      White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Jackson will attend her briefing Tuesday to provide a more complete readout on Trump's physical health.      Not expected are any conclusions about Trump's mental acuity. Questions about Trump's mental fitness have been raised following comments attributed to some of his close advisers in a new book, and his recent slurring of words on national TV.      Presidents aren't required to get a checkup, but modern presidents do so regularly and release a doctor's report on the findings. ||||| CLOSE President Donald Trump's overall health \\"is excellent\\" and he did \\"exceedingly well\\" on cognitive screening. That's according to his White House physician, Navy doctor Ronny Jackson. (Jan. 16) AP      President Trump shakes hands with White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson after Friday's physical. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)      WASHINGTON – A White House doctor pronounced President Trump medically fit to serve as commander-in-chief on Tuesday – and added that he easily passed a voluntary cognitive assessment designed to test his mental reflexes.      \\"The president's overall health is excellent,\\" Dr. Ronny Jackson told reporters during an unusual hour-long briefing at the White House, days after completing the Trump's first physical examination as president.      Jackson did say that the 71-year-old, 239-pound president could use more exercise and a better diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates. Trump, who is known to eat junk food and to avoid exercise beyond golf, is overweight and has set a \\"reasonable goal\\" of losing 10 to 15 pounds in the coming year and developing a regular fitness routine, the doctor said.      \\"He’s more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part,\\" Jackson added.

How can Trump eat a lot of fast food, exercise little and be healthy?      The president's yearly physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which took place on Friday, is a routine practice. But Trump's exam has taken on heightened scrutiny amid questions about his mental fitness.      Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who wore his uniform to the White House press room, said it's the first time he knows of that a cognitive test has been given to a sitting president.      Cognitive assessment      Critics began openly questioning Trump's mental heath this month following a tweet in which he said he has a bigger nuclear button than North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, and the publication of Fire and Fury, a book about the White House, in which anonymous Trump acquaintances questioned the president's mental stability.      Trump, earlier this month, pushed back over Twitter, insisting he is a \\"very stable genius\\" and that mental stability is one of his greatest assets.      Jackson said he “initially had no intention” of including a test of the president’s mental fitness in his first annual physical, and stressed that he had “absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability or neurological functions.\\" Such exams are not usually part of presidential physicals.      Still, at the president's request, Jackson did an assessment to screen for any cognitive impairment such as Alzheimers – and Trump got a perfect score.      \\"The president is mentally very sharp,\\" Jackson said.      More: Trump, mocking questions on his mental state, tweets he is a 'stable genius'      Diet and exercise      The president has a body mass index of 29.9 which places him in the overweight category on the verge of obesity, which is defined as a BMI of 30 or greater.      Trump, who has gained three pounds since his physical in 2016, takes a drug to reduce his cholesterol, and Jackson said he may increase the dosage. The doctor added that Trump does not use tobacco or alcohol, one of the reasons he is in good health generally.      Asked how Trump could stay healthy on a diet that includes McDonald's and Diet Cokes, Jackson said: \\"It's called genetics – I don't know.\\"      While Trump's may be the dream diet of a teenage boy, it's a nightmare for those trying to model or message that healthy eating — and exercise — are the key to good health. And that is something Jackson is going to work with him to change.      \\"There are 'good' genes, but what research has shown us is that more than genes, more than health care, more than social circumstances, behaviors are the leading cause of premature death,\\" says Bernadette Melnyk, a professor and dean of Ohio State University's college of nursing and the university's chief wellness officer. \\"And there's good evidence behind that.\\"      After all, one's genes can only do so much.      \\"Some gene variants are slightly more efficient at detoxifying harmful chemicals in the liver, which leads to a slightly decreased cancer risk,\\" says Maureen Murphy, a cancer geneticist with the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. \\"But I don’t think good genetics trumps — I mean beats — bad lifestyle.\\"      Trump is well known for questioning whether exercise is beneficial and doesn't appear to get any beyond golfing with a cart.      This activity burns only about half as many calories than walking, or an average of 411 calories for nine holes, according to a study by Neal Wolkendoff of the Colorado Center for Health and Sport Science.      Even if Trump has enjoyed good health until his early 70s, that doesn't mean his lifestyle will lead to longevity.      \\"Luck is a huge part and it might not last,\\" Murphy said.      A thorough briefing      Under repeated questioning at the White House that lasted an hour, Jackson said he had no concerns about Trump's physical, mental, or emotional ability to do the job.      Jackson said Trump encouraged him to speak with reporters about the physical, and to take every question they had.      According to Jackson, Trump told Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, \\"I do not want you pulling him off that stage.\\"      Reporters peppered Jackson with questions about his tweeting and television-watching habits and how much sleep he gets a night. Jackson estimated that Trump only gets four to five hours of sleep a night. \\"He doesn't sleep much,\\" he said.      Asked about the president's slurring of words during a recent speech, Jackson said there is no medical evidence of impaired vocal performance, and said it was probably just a dry throat.      \\"I think I need a drink of water,\\" he joked.

I had several injuries and bled from the forceful nature of their arrest.      \\"I didn’t think they were there for me. I assumed there was some sort of training exercise or event at the hotel but I was shocked to see them barge at me.\\"      Mr Al Menhali obeyed police orders to lie down and be searched.      He suffered a panic attack and collapsed after they released him and was taken by ambulance to St John Medical Centre.      Mr Al Menhani, who is married with three children, has been in Ohio since April after having heart surgery in the UAE following a stroke. \\"I always wear my traditional clothes during all my travels and never encountered such a thing,\\" he said.      He was trying to book a room at the Fairfield Inn and Suites as the flat in which he was staying was being rented out for the Republican convention this month.      \\"The hotel staff were nice to me and told me that they didn’t have any availabilities, but I was surprised that the receptionist disappeared with my papers for a prolonged period of time with no apparent reason.\\"      The Avon police department said they had received a 911 call from the family of a female clerk at the hotel.      Police were alerted to \\"a suspicious man with disposable phones — two of them — in a full head dress\\".      They received a second call from the clerk’s father requesting that officers be sent to the hotel.      Officers ordered Mr Al Menhali to lay on the ground and drop his phone. Police said that at first he did not respond, but eventually did.      A search found no weapons on him. When police spoke to the hotel clerk, they learnt that Mr Al Menhali had not made any statements related to ISIL. Officers said there had been a miscommunication.      Body camera footage from police was released and circulated online.      After the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation urged Emiratis not to wear national dress when travelling overseas, for their own safety.      On Sunday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation summoned the deputy US ambassador Ethan Goldrich to protest at the \\"abusive treatment\\".      Rawda Al Otaiba, Director of the American Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed her dismay at Mr Al Menhali treatment: \\"Police arrested and searched the Emirati without any right. He was also defamed by publishing footage of the incident,\\" reported state news agency, Wam.      Mr Goldrich apologised, and said the incident was an exception, and unacceptable. He said authorities in Ohio would be working with the embassy to clarify the matter.      The US Ambassador to the UAE, Barbara Leaf, said Mr Al Menhali’s experience in the US was deeply regrettable: \\"We are pleased that city officials met him & apologised,\\" she tweeted on Monday.      The US embassy in the UAE issued the following statement: \\"Since learning of the regrettable situation that took place in Avon, Ohio last week, the UAE Embassy has been in close contact with Mr. Al Menhali and his family.\\"      The UAE’s Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba spoke with Avon’s Mayor and asked that he take appropriate steps to ensure a similar incident does not happen again, the statement read.      Mr Al Menhali is still in the US continuing his treatment.      The hotel where the incident took place has yet to comment. Marriott International which owns the Fairfield Inn and Suites issued the following statement: \\"The unusual behaviour of a man that had entered the hotel caused the hotel staff to be concerned. A call was placed to the local authorities who responded right away. As this is a police matter it would be inappropriate to comment further\\".      nalremeithi@thenational.ae      UPDATE: Police and officials apologise to Emirati arrested in US ||||| Deputy ambassador apologises after Ohio receptionist calls 911 on man in formal dress, thinking he was a member of Isis      The United Arab Emirates has urged men to avoid wearing the white robes, headscarf and headband of the national dress when travelling abroad, after a businessman visiting the United States was wrestled to the ground and held as an Islamic State suspect.            UAE media reported that the Emirati man was detained in Avon, Ohio, last week after a female clerk at a local hotel called 911 to report what she had described as a man affiliated to Islamic State, according to the Arabic-language al-Bayan newspaper.      The English language newspaper the National said the receptionist at the Fairfield Inn hotel called the police after she heard the man talking on his phone in the hotel lobby. The woman reportedly described him as “a suspicious man with disposable phones – two of them – in a full head dress.”      Gulf News, another UAE newspaper, published photos of the Emirati man in white robes being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed before being led away by police.      The man, who sustained injuries in the incident, told the National that the police were “brutal”.      A search by police found no weapons on him. The National reported that when police spoke to the hotel clerk, they found he had not made any statements related to Isis. Officers said there had been a miscommunication.      In a message on a foreign ministry Twitter account aimed at citizens travelling abroad, the ministry said on Saturday:      UAE businessman pays out £3.4m for number plate '1' Read more      “For citizens travelling outside the country, and in order to ensure their safety, we point out not to wear formal dress while travelling, especially in public places,” the message dated 2 July stated, without referring to the Avon incident.      The foreign ministry said in a statement it had summoned US deputy ambassador Ethan Goldrich to protest the “abusive treatment by the Ohio police of a UAE citizen” and to deplore the filming of his arrest which it described as defamation.      “The UAE cares for the safety of its citizens and demands clarifications about the incident,” it said in a statement carried by WAM state news agency.      Goldrich “apologised” for the incident, pledging to seek clarifications from authorities in the state of Ohio, WAM said.      The mayor of Avon and the city’s police chief also apologised.

On 22 September 2010, Owen netted his first goals of the season as he netted twice during a 5-2 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup. Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season as he netted United's second equaliser with his first touch in a 2-2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers. Owen's first goal of 2011 came in United's 2-1 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on 29 January. On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United's game against Bolton.  By the time of United's penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner's medal - his first in 15 seasons as a professional. The game, on 14 May 2011, only required United to draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park to win the title, and a 1-1 draw secured it for them. Owen was an unused substitute in the game. Owen scored United's final goal in their last league game of the season, at home to Blackpool, in which the Red Devils won 4-2.  Owen was an unused substitute in Man United's uninspiring Champions League final defeat to Barcelona, marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.","output":"This text is about Michael Owen, the former professional footballer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours. If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it, chances are she’s interested in you. She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking.  Of course, you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy. Just glance in her direction, or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds. However, some girls are just shy, and they may not want to make eye contact with you. Try encouraging her with other steps. Smiling shows your interest, and makes it easy for her to smile back at you. Sometimes, it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other. Even if you’re nervous, smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people. In other words, when you smile at her, her brain perceives it as a reward, making her happier to be around you. Don’t just hang around with the same group of friends. It’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group, so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around, she might come over and talk to you. You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available. You never know what might happen. For instance, maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school. Make it a point to show up there, too. Try sitting at a table near her, where she can see you. ” It’s an easy first step and a way to acknowledge that you’re noticing each other. You don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy. If she’s unwilling to say “hi” back, she might not be interested. Try it a few more times, but if she never responds, let it go. You might be nervous about approaching her, but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her. If she’s responded to your greeting, you can move ahead to actually talking to each other. Consider what you know about her, as that can lead to a conversation. Is she part of the drama club, or does she play sports? Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation. You could even try to be funny, but that can be hard.  You could ask, \\"Is your training on the track team really hard?\\" or \\"What did you think of the pep rally?\\" You could also say something like, \\"Wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today? Isn't it awful what they call food?\\" or \\"Don’t you think Mr. Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda?\\" Now that you have some possible questions, find a good time to talk to her. It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities, and hopefully when you’re both alone. It can feel really awkward the first time, but it does get easier. If she really responds and starts asking you questions too, chances are that she is interested in you. If she doesn’t really respond, it’s likely she’s not that into you. For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, \\"Yes, but I love it!\\" In that case, you could say, \\"Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.\\"","output":"To determine if a girl is interested in you, observe her body language, and in particular, her eye contact. If she consistently makes eye contact, blushes, or steals quick glances when she thinks you're not looking, these cues may suggest she's interested in you. However, avoid staring at her, as this may appear creepy. Instead, try holding her gaze for a few seconds or glancing in her direction. When interacting with her, smiling can effectively convey your interest. This elicits a positive response because the brain perceives a smile as a reward. Give her an opportunity to approach you by sometimes spending time alone rather than with friends, as it's easier to engage someone who's by themselves. You could also visit places where she frequently spends time, such as a library, to increase chances of interaction. Starting with a simple greeting can ease the initial conversation. If she responds, try engaging her with topics related to school activities or things you know she likes. This could involve asking questions about her hobbies or making light-hearted comments about shared experiences at school. Look for an appropriate moment when neither of you is in a hurry and possibly alone to have these conversations. As the conversation unfolds, pay attention to how she responds. If she engages and reciprocates with questions, there's a higher likelihood that she's interested in you. However, if her responses are minimal or unenthusiastic, it's possible that she may not be as interested as you thought. Remember, it may feel awkward during the initial conversation, but as you get to know each other better, the interaction should become easier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

By stating that the movie \\"simultaneously degrades its characters, its stars, and its audience,\\" the critic is suggesting that the film is disrespectful and insulting to multiple aspects of the filmmaking and viewing experience. The use of the word \\"degrades\\" has a negative connotation, as it implies a lowering in quality, moral or otherwise, which adds to the overall negativity of the review. When a movie degrades its characters, it might involve poorly constructed character arcs or portray them in a demeaning manner. This implies that the movie doesn't take the time or effort to build strong, well-rounded, and relatable characters that appeal to the audience. The comment that the movie also degrades its stars suggests that there could be possible issues with the casting or that the actors are not well utilized in their roles, which might cause the potential of the stars to be overshadowed, wasted, or poorly represented. Furthermore, by stating that the movie degrades its audience, the critic is implying that the film fails to engage the viewers intellectually, emotionally, or morally. This could mean that the movie does not do justice to the expectations of the audience or that the content itself might be offensive or inconsiderate. The overall focus on degradation conveys a disapproval of the movie and its content, as it implies that being associated with such material is degrading for all parties involved.

Given the question: Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing. It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“.

Roger gives him advice which he has heard from somebody else.Roger's customers, Abigail Page (Paula Prentiss) and Isolde 'Easy' Mueller (Maria Perschy), want Roger to participate on the fishing competition in lake C..... Easy is a public relations officer, and Abigail is an important person of the community. Roger will compete against Major Phipps. However, Rock tries to get out of the idea, as he has not idea about fishing. His boss, William Cadwalader (John McGiver) pushes him to win the competition.Abigail and Easy are both interested in Roger, although they realise fast that he has no idea about fishing. They pay John Screaming Eagle (Norman Alden) not to say anything about Roger being useless with fish. John is also a small conman. He isn't unable to put up even his net.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who did Fluffy protect? ?  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts. Answer:","output":"Fluffy protected Lazlo from Edward and Lumpus. When they tried to confront Lazlo, they were met by Fluffy, who attacked them in order to protect Lazlo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Benedykt Ossolinsky, age 39, began to grow childish. On the first day of his midlife crisis, he stood in front of the mirror examining his receding hairline and wrinkles on his face. In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work. He had to go to the office at least three times a week for two full hours and entertain various smiling journalists, drink coffee with them and listen. He had to sign letters and open gifts from various companies hoping to win favors. And he had to play golf and attend social functions, movie premiers, shows and art exhibits. The family had only planned for three months of vacation time a year. Scandal! As a sign of protest he took to coming to the office wearing a t-shirt with the slogan \\"Attention, Baby!\\" on it.

Please answer this question: Who wrote the 1924 musical composition ‘Rhapsody in Blue’?","output":"The 1924 musical composition 'Rhapsody in Blue' was written by George Gershwin, an accomplished American pianist, composer, and conductor. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 26, 1898, Gershwin grew up in a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. He flourished both as a composer of popular songs and as a composer of more serious orchestral works. Gershwin's innate talent for blending elements of jazz, classical, and popular music made his compositions highly distinctive and unique. 'Rhapsody in Blue' was first conceived by Gershwin's longtime friend and collaborator, band leader Paul Whiteman, who wanted to create a concert that demonstrated the evolution of American music. Whiteman later asked Gershwin to contribute an original piece for an all-jazz concert he was planning, which would later be known as \\"An Experiment in Modern Music.\\" Gershwin, who was hesitant at first, decided to take on the project after a newspaper article announced that he was working on a \\"jazz concerto.\\" The musical piece was composed in a very short period, in approximately three weeks, as Gershwin faced a tight deadline for the concert. Gershwin drew inspiration from his various experiences, including the sounds of the bustling city of New York, as is evident in the diverse musical motifs present throughout the composition. The premiere of 'Rhapsody in Blue' took place on February 12, 1924, at New York's Aeolian Hall, with Gershwin playing the piano alongside Paul Whiteman's Palais Royal Orchestra. 'Rhapsody in Blue' combines classical composition techniques with the rhythmic and improvisational elements of jazz. The piece begins with an iconic clarinet glissando, which was originally a joke from the rehearsal but ultimately became one of the most memorable openings in 20th-century American music. The composition was met with critical and commercial success, and it propelled Gershwin into the spotlight as a serious composer on the American music scene. 'Rhapsody in Blue' has since become emblematic of the fusion between jazz and classical music, standing the test of time as a unique and beloved work that is still widely enjoyed today. George Gershwin continued to produce a plethora of prominent works throughout his life, including the opera 'Porgy and Bess' and the orchestral piece 'An American in Paris.' Unfortunately, Gershwin's brilliant career was cut short as he tragically passed away at the young age of 38 from a brain tumor. Despite his early death, Gershwin's prolific output and groundbreaking compositions left an enduring impact on American music that echoes through the generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Herbs are tender plants that won’t do well if sown in cold temperatures. Therefore, you should plant herbs outdoors in the spring once the temperatures, and the soil, have begun to warm up. To find the average frost dates for your area, check your local weather app. If you purchased herb plants, rather than seeds, you’ll need to dig holes for each plant. Make sure the holes have the same depth as the container and are twice as wide. Use your hands to carefully remove the plant from the container and gently break up the roots. Place the plant in the soil, with only the root ball below the surface, and lightly pack the soil around the plant. Use your finger or the eraser end of a pencil to make shallow indentations in the soil. Place 1 seed in each space, then lightly cover it with soil. Take care not to bury the seeds too deep, or they won’t germinate. Once your seeds or plants are in the garden or containers, lightly water them to compact the soil. If you transplanted the herbs, be sure to water down to the root zone to help the plant become established in the soil. Since many herbs look similar, it’s a good idea to place labels in the garden or containers. You can put the seed packet in a plastic bag and staple it to a wooden stake, which can then be placed in front of the herbs. You could also use the plant label that came with the plants and stick it into the soil near the herbs. Or, you could even make your own labels, such as by painting the herb names on rocks and placing them near each herb. No matter which type of label you choose, make sure it is waterproof!","output":"Plant herbs outside in warm spring temperatures, making holes for each plant, and gently place the plant or seeds in the soil with labels, and water them carefully."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the question \\"Where does this conversation take place?\\" and the answer \\"at their home\\", write a conversation that might have happened.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, I will consider each step of the sedimentary rock formation process and identify the potential effects of a drop in air pressure on sediment deposition. 1. Wind and water erode rocks:  A decrease in air pressure can result in stronger winds due to a steeper pressure gradient. Stronger winds can result in increased rates of erosion, causing more sediment to be available. 2. The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks: With stronger winds, as a result of the air pressure drop, there would likely be more sediment being picked up and transported by the wind. 3. Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice: The decrease in air pressure could potentially lead to a change in weather conditions, affecting the transport of sediment. For example, stronger winds might carry sediment further away before deposition. 4. Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times: The deposition of sediment could be affected by a change in air pressure. More sediment might be deposited if stronger winds lead to increased erosion of source rocks. 5. The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time: As more sediment is deposited in an area, the sediment layers would continue to accumulate. While the change in air pressure might not directly affect this step, it could influence the amount of sediment being deposited. 6. The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment: A drop in air pressure could indirectly affect this step by altering the rate at which sediment accumulates. However, the compression process itself would not be directly affected by air pressure change. 7. The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight: While the rate of sediment deposition might be affected by air pressure changes, the lithification process by which sediment becomes sedimentary rock remains the same, regardless of air pressure conditions. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of a drop in air pressure could have an indirect effect on sediment deposition, primarily through increased wind erosion and the transportation of sediment. However, the processes of compression and lithification remain mostly unaffected by the change in air pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

New Year axe murder victim Tanis Bhandari was killed after a trivial argument over a cigarette, it was claimed yesterday. The 27-year-old plasterer was described as a ‘peaceful’ former member of the Royal Navy who doted on his younger siblings. More than 100 of his friends and family gathered yesterday outside the village pub where he died in a horrific axe attack an hour into the new year. Scroll down for video. Tanis Bhandari, 27, was killed in an axe and knife attack outside a quiet village pub on New Year's Eve. A spokesman for the pub said it was saddened by the unprovoked attack on a group of 'lovely' people. Above, mourners gather outside the Kings Arms. Dozens of bunches of flowers were left on the tiny green by the Kings Arms in sleepy Tamerton Foliot on the edge of Plymouth, Devon. Many mourners – including a woman believed to be the victim’s mother, Andrea Sharpe – wore shirts bearing the logo of his favourite football club, Liverpool. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder, though neither has been charged. It was today claimed the attack came about when one of the suspects asked a female friend of Mr Bhandari's for a cigarette. When she said no, Mr Bhandari, a builder, stood in front of her to protect her from harm, a source told MailOnline. It was then he was attacked with a knife and axe-like weapon, the source added. Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm the altercation had begun over a cigarette, but said Mr Bhandari was the victim of an unprovoked attack. 'The evidence gathered so far points to this being an indiscriminate attack on a group of innocent young men, resulting in a tragic outcome,' Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today. 'I understand and appreciate how this attack has come as a shock to many, especially the residents of Tamerton Foliot. 'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody. 'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.' 'I understand and appreciate how this attack has come as a shock to many, especially the residents of Tamerton Foliot. 'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody. 'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.' An axe was later recovered by detectives, with residents asked to check their gardens and bins for a missing knife as police continued to search for clues. Mourners visited the site where Mr Bhandari and his friends were attacked to lay flowers today. Friends hung Liverpool FC scarves around a tree near the pub. Mr Bhandari was a keen supporter of the club. Mourners gathered outside the green where the group of men were attacked today to pay their respects. Mourners console one another as they lay flowers outside the Kings Arms in Tamerton Foilot. Two men, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in police custody. Devon and Cornwall Police this afternoon sought an extension from Magistrates to continue questioning the pair. Friends have today paid tribute to Mr Bhandari who they described as 'kind' and 'an amazing friend'. More than 100 people gathered at around 10.30am yesterday to lay flowers outside the pub in the historic village, which is popular with walkers. Liverpool football tops and scarves were tied to trees nearby. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook. Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’ Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’ A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub. 'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement. 'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.' Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy. 'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' Others shared their grief on Facebook. 'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.' Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to come forward. Devon and Cornwall Police continue investigating the scene following the arrest of two men, aged 20 and 21. Forensics teams sweep leaves and rocks near to where the man and his friends were attacked. Police are still appealing for information about the attack which took place in the early hours of Thursday morning. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Tanis Bhandari, a 27-year-old former Royal Navy member and plasterer, was killed in an axe and knife attack outside the Kings Arms pub in Tamerton Foliot near Plymouth, Devon, on New Year's Eve. The attack allegedly occurred after a trivial argument over a cigarette when a female friend of Mr. Bhandari refused a cigarette to one of the suspects. Mr. Bhandari stepped in to protect her and was then attacked with a knife and axe-like weapon. Over 100 friends and family members gathered outside the village pub to mourn his loss. Many wore shirts bearing the logo of his favorite football club, Liverpool. Dozens of bunches of flowers and Liverpool FC scarves were placed on the scene.  Two men, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested on suspicion of murder, but neither has been charged. Devon and Cornwall Police are continuing their investigation and have asked residents to check their gardens and bins for a missing knife as they search for additional clues. An axe has been recovered by detectives. Police describe the attack as \\"indiscriminate\\" on a group of innocent young men and reassure local residents that they are doing everything they can to solve the case. Friends and acquaintances of Mr. Bhandari describe him as \\"kind,\\" \\"peaceful,\\" and an \\"amazing friend.\\""},{"instruction":"Given the question: Dialogue:  M: Hi, Ann.

On the bright side, Dudovitz has extended his respected program to clients in the San Gabriel-Pomona Valley, and he now operates on a much larger budget, 6.5 million last year. However, his clash with the old San Gabriel program resulted in litigation, bitter feelings and a mission that some say is not clearly focused on serving poor people. \\"It was a difficult situation that was probably mishandled by everyone,\\" a longtime observer of the public interest community said of the San Fernando Valley-San Gabriel-Pomona Valley merger. \\"There are very few people who come out as the heroes.

Jason wanted to keep his friend safe and out of trouble. Donald was very excited about his new farming adventure. He believed that he could help many people feel better by growing Medical Marijuana. So, he did a lot of research about how to grow the plants and all the rules he has to obey. Since Jason cared for Donald, he decided to help his friend. He wanted to make sure that Donald didn't make any mistakes that could cause problems. Both of them began to study all about Medical Marijuana to become experts on how to grow it correctly and legally. Together, they worked hard and built a beautiful farm where they could grow the plants. Each day, they took care of the plants, watering them and making sure they got enough sunlight to grow strong and healthy. They also talked to other farmers and medical experts to learn even more about how to be the best Medical Marijuana farmers they could be. As the plants grew, so did their friendship and teamwork. Donald was very grateful for Jason's support, and Jason could see that Medical Marijuana could make a positive difference in people's lives when used responsibly. In the end, they became successful Medical Marijuana farmers, known for their dedication and care. Many people who were in pain or needed help started to feel better because of the special plants they grew.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not  heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother.

Elmo's mother rarely stayed up past 10:00 PM, and it was nearly 11:00. She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Brad had a friend that lived on Oahu, part of The Hawaiian Islands. The friend's name was Hank and he invited Brad over to visit the islands. Brad had never been there before, and he lived in London, UK.  But I can use this background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loih  What is an answer for this question: Which friend lived farther from Kilauea volcano? Answer:","output":"To answer the question \\"Which friend lived farther from Kilauea volcano?\\" we need to compare the distances of Brad and Hank from the volcano.

(42 + 0) * p = (15 + 8) * p - 361 42p = 23p - 361 Next, we need to isolate the 'p' variable. To do this, we can subtract 23p from both sides of the equation. 42p - 23p = 23p - 361 - 23p Which simplifies to: 19p = -361 Now, we just need to solve for 'p' by dividing by 19 on both sides of the equation. 19p / 19 = -361 / 19 This simplifies to: p = -19 So, the answer is p = -19."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Courtesy Jane Rosenberg      While a federal court takes the next step in resolving Deflategate, a courtroom sketch emerged Wednesday of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and the duo's assorted legal counsel.      The sketch, by artist Jane Rosenberg, lit up the Internet for its rough and approximate portrayal of Brady.      It features, from left, Jeff Pash, NFL executive vice president and general counsel; Goodell; Gregg Levy, NFL counsel; Adolpho Birch, NFL executive VP; Don Yee, Brady's agent; and Brady.      To be fair, Brady's face is one of the most recognizable in sports. Anything but pure photorealism would have provoked comments. And a courtroom artist's job is to capture the scene quickly. They aren't intending to emulate the Dutch masters.      But social media doesn't care about that. It cares about memes.      Brady Krueger.

Crowds cheered Tom Brady (and booed Roger Goodell) as he arrived in New York for his hearing. [Credit: Mary Altaffer/AP] A photo posted by espn (@espn) on Aug 12, 2015 at 7:52am PDT      As of Wednesday afternoon, there was no settlement in the case. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      “This courtroom sketch of Tom Brady will haunt your dreams,” Fusion declared.      “Tom Brady’s face melted at the DeflateGate hearing, according to this courtroom sketch,” SB Nation surmised.      “It looks like Brady’s face was put in one of those machines that crushes cars,” USA Today said.      These were among the headlines and observations overshadowing the New England quarterback’s hearing in federal court on Wednesday, at least as far as the response on social media is concerned. Brady is appealing a four-game suspension for his role in the deflation of footballs used in the AFC championship game in January.      This is the sketch, by the New York artist Jane Rosenberg, that prompted the backlash:      In 2011, The New York Times noted that Ms. Rosenberg’s likeness of Robert De Niro during a court appearance in Manhattan was “remarkably accurate.” She has been a sketch artist for 35 years, depicting a litany of public figures including Woody Allen, Martha Stewart, Bill Cosby and John Gotti.      In a telephone interview, Ms. Rosenberg said drawing celebrities is her most difficult task, as people already have an image of how the person is supposed to look. She was hired by several media clients to attend Brady’s hearing, and was “under a lot of pressure to work very quickly and do the best I can on the short deadline I’m on.”      “I’m getting bad criticism that I made him look like Lurch,” she said, referring to the Addams Family character. “And obviously I apologize to Tom Brady for not making him as good-looking as he is.”      In response, Twitter users deployed their best photo-editing skills.      As of Wednesday evening, Ms. Rosenberg said she was not bothered by the response, partly because she didn’t understand it. She doesn’t use social media, though some people had shown her some of the tweets on their phones. She also doesn’t watch the N.F.L.      Photo      “I don’t know what the big deal is,” she said. “I’m a background person. There’s a whole new world of social media, and I’m not with it.”      There were other sketch artists in the courtroom, though the others drew Brady quite differently and, as a result, didn’t receive as much attention. Andrea Shepard and her mother, Shirley, approached Brady after the hearing and asked him to sign a couple of their sketches, which he did without a fuss.      Asked later if they tried to get Brady to buy a sketch, Andrea Shepard said: “I think they were all upset because they were together,” referring to Brady and Commissioner Roger Goodell. No, she didn’t get a sale. ||||| \\"Tell Tom Brady I'm Sorry.\\" Q&A; With the DeflateGate Courtroom Sketch Artist      Jane Rosenberg has been a courtroom sketch artist for decades, having drawn scenes from high profile cases such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as well as others involving celebrities such as Woody Allen, Martha Stewart, and John Gotti.      On Wednesday, she was tasked to do courtroom sketches for Wednesday's settlement hearing in the ongoing #deflategate saga. Her sketch of Tom Brady in the courtroom went viral almost instantly, and not all of the attention was flattering. Many people on social media criticized her depiction of the quarterback. VICE Sports spoke to her over the phone as she was leaving the courthouse and first experiencing the bizarre whirlwind of everything that comes with her painstaking work being turned into a viral meme. It was yet another bit of nonsense from a whole case full of nonsense. Rosenberg was just doing her job and certainly wasn't looking for the attention.      Rosenberg seemed a bit flustered on the phone as she was dealing with having unexpectedly become part of the day's news.      What kind of response have you seen to the sketch so far?      Well I haven't seen any. People are emailing me and calling me and trying to interview me. I don't do Twitter or Facebook so social media is not my thing. But obviously it's gone viral. Some people are like sending me snippets though––things, complaints, that I made him look like Lurch or whatever. Tell Tom Brady, I'm sorry. He's a very good looking guy and if I didn't make him look good enough, I'll try harder next time.      When you are doing the sketches, how realistic do you try to make it look? And how much are you just trying to capture a mood?      I'm working very quickly. Obviously I have a lot of pressure on me, and it's time pressure. It's lucky if I have a few minutes. So I'm just trying to grab onto something, just as quick as I can. Now, this Tom Brady thing, I did this whole wide shot with a million people in it. And everybody's focusing on that one little fraction of the whole picture, of Tom Brady. But it's really a big wide composition. There's a lot of people and the whole courtroom in it.      When you have a case like this with a highly recognizable person, do you feel any more pressure?      Yes, I do. I do feel more pressure. It's horrible. You hate that. Especially when they're good looking, that's the worst. I'd rather do famous terrorists or something.      Do you plan on looking up any of the reaction when you get home?      I don't know. I don't do Twitter. I don't even know if I could. I don't know how I'm going to see it all. I'm sure it's horrible. Maybe I'll be depressed tomorrow, who knows? Right now I'm not reacting.      Does it bother you if people are making fun of it or anything like that?      Does it bother me, people making fun of me? I don't know. It hasn't sunk in yet. I might be very depressed. I'm my biggest critic, myself. So I feel terrible when I do a bad sketch. So when the whole world is criticizing me, I might just kill myself. Or I might just laugh it off. Who knows? ||||| Today, legendary New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady went to federal court to participate in a hearing as a part of the ongoing drama surrounding the Deflategate controversy.

Title: Disappointing Review: I found this book to be disappointing. The author spends too much time explaining and describing things which add nothing to the main point of the book; an extraordinary tale of survival in Nazi Germany. I found that the story could have been told in less than half of the pages that the author uses and not spend countless chapters on descriptions of relatives and acquaintances that have little to do with the overall story. The bottom line is that, fortunately for the author, nothing much happens. I am happy that the author was not actively persecuted and that he was able to survive that totalitarian regime.

Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place.

The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent   amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems.

Question 2: Christmas: Why does Santa wear red? OPTIONS: (A). no. (B). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Did Father Christmas used to wear green clothes? If so, why was his clothing color changed to red? Answer: Yes, Father Christmas, the British precursor to Santa Claus, did indeed wear green clothes, traditionally representing the pagan symbol of the rebirth of the sun during the winter season. However, this portrayal of Father Christmas evolved over time, and he was sometimes depicted wearing different colored robes, including red.  As for the change to red clothing, this can be attributed to multiple factors. One of the most popular explanations is the influence of Coca-Cola's 1930s advertising campaign. Artist Haddon Sundblom was commissioned by Coca-Cola to create images of Santa Claus for their advertisements. He drew inspiration from the 1823 poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (commonly known as \\"The Night Before Christmas\\") by Clement Clarke Moore, which describes St. Nicholas in a red suit. Sundblom's illustrations gained widespread popularity and cemented the image of Santa Claus/Father Christmas in a red suit with white fur trims. However, it is important to note that even before the Coca-Cola campaign, American illustrator Thomas Nast depicted Santa Claus in a red suit in his drawings for Harper's Weekly in the 1860s. St. Nicholas, the historical figure who inspired Santa Claus, was also associated with the color red as he was a bishop in the 4th century, and bishops wore red vestments at that time.  Question 2: Christmas: Why does Santa wear red? OPTIONS: (A). no. (B). yes. In the context of the question, \\"no\\" and \\"yes\\" are not appropriate answers. However, the correct answer, based on the information provided above, is that Santa Claus wears red due to a combination of factors, such as the influence of Thomas Nast's and Haddon Sundblom's illustrations, the historic association with St. Nicholas, and the 1823 poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas.\\" To clarify if the questions are asking the same thing: Question 1 asks about Father Christmas, specifically if he wore green clothes and why the color changed to red. It pertains to the historical and cultural roots of Father Christmas' attire and the factors that contributed to the change in color. Question 2 asks why Santa Claus wears red clothes. It is seeking an explanation for the current popular depiction of Santa Claus' attire.  Both questions touch upon the history and origin of Santa Claus and Father Christmas' attire, but they are not exactly the same. Question 1 delves into the gradual transformation of Father Christmas' clothing, while Question 2 aims to explain why Santa Claus is popularly depicted wearing red. Nonetheless, there is significant overlap between the two questions, and the answers provided for each question touch upon the same historical and cultural factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was the father of former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Austen Chamberlain, who became chancellor of the exchequer. Historians, government ministers and MPs are meeting in Birmingham to mark his achievements, 100 years since his death. Joseph Chamberlain was born in Camberwell, London, on 8 July, 1836. While attending University College School in London he also worked in his father's shoemaking business. At the age of 18 he was sent to his uncle's screw-making business, Nettlefolds, in Birmingham, mainly to protect his father's Â£10,000 investment in the firm. By his 30s he had made enough money to retire, but had garnered an appetite for local politics and in 1867 joined what was then Birmingham town council. It was not granted city status until 1889. \\"He was strongly influenced to get into politics by the Unitarian church who believed the only form of faith was what they called 'up and doing' - putting a civic gospel into practice,\\" said Dr Ian Cawood, from Newman University in Birmingham. \\"He was one of the more successful at doing this because he had great business sense and the money to support himself.\\" Chamberlain became mayor of Birmingham in 1873. His first major decision was to buy both the Birmingham and Staffordshire gas companies and effect a hostile takeover of Birmingham Waterworks. The following year he launched his Â£1.75m city improvement scheme, which used money from the gas industry and public funds to build libraries, schools and  swimming pools. It also included clearing slum housing to build a \\"Parisian boulevard-style\\" road, Corporation Street. His legacy can still be seen across the city and includes the Victorian Law Courts on Corporation Street and his family home, Highbury Hall, built in 1880. The estate, which includes Highbury Park, has been run by Birmingham City Council under the terms of a trust set up by the Chamberlain family in the 1930s. The hall is used as a wedding venue. It was Chamberlain's achievements in Birmingham that catapulted him on to the national stage as Liberal MP for the then town in 1876 and President of the Board of Trade in William Gladstone's government in 1880. Prof Peter Marsh, who wrote Chamberlain's biography in 1994, said: \\"Under his guidance Birmingham was known as the best-governed city in the industrial world. \\"Although he had his critics, the thinking then was if you could carry Birmingham you could carry the country - it had huge national prominence.\\" The BBC's political editor for the Midlands, Patrick Burns, said: \\"His rise was fast - he was just over 40 when he became the first industrialist to hold a cabinet position. \\"We have seen examples where people have been put forward after capitalising on local issues - David Blunkett was a big figure in Sheffield before he moved to government - but they tend to be the exception rather than the rule.\\" Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore said he believed local authorities now yearned for a return to Chamberlain's values. \\"He showed that a great city must not only have thriving businesses, but powerful civic institutions and governance that cares about health, housing and the education of its citizens,\\" said the Labour politician. \\"Today, we are far too reliant on central government for funding and hemmed in by regulations. In Birmingham there are a number of memorials to Joseph Chamberlain, but no statue. There is the \\"Old Joe\\" clock tower at the University of Birmingham and a monument in Chamberlain Square. A college, a bar and a gym are named after him. To coincide with the 100th anniversary of Chamberlain's death, historians are starting a campaign to have a statue erected. A marble statue was put up in Westminster Abbey. It was later relocated to a corridor outside a House of Lords committee room. Dr Ian Cawood from Newman University said the city council had looked at the idea of bringing the statue to Birmingham, but it would cost about Â£80,000. \\"I believe if we were given more freedom we could really drive economic growth and improve the lives of our citizens.\\" Dr Cawood said Chamberlain was seen as Britain's \\"first truly modern, professional politician\\". He is credited as the first MP to print and hand out propaganda leaflets, much like today's election flyers, he said. But while his public persona grew, his ambitions to land the job of prime minister all but ended in 1886, when he resigned from the government over William Gladstone's Irish Home Rule proposals. \\"Chamberlain believed giving Ireland a separate parliament could lead to the eventual break-up of the British Empire,\\" said Mr Cawood. \\"It was a desperate mistake which left him on the wrong side of the government divide. \\"He ended up having to become an ally of the Conservatives, but neither they nor the Liberals really wholly trusted him after that.\\" Following the setback Chamberlain became colonial secretary in Lord Salisbury's government in 1895. \\"His issue was empire building. He had worked to build up the screws business he had built up Birmingham and he used the same ethos for his work with the colonies,\\" said Prof Marsh. \\"He raised the Empire to the height of its power at the beginning of the 20th Century to see off the growing rivalry from France, Germany and the rising United States.\\" In September 1903, Joseph Chamberlain resigned from office so he could advocate a scheme abandoning free trade and imposing taxes on foreign imports. The issue split the Conservative Party and resulted in a landslide victory for the Liberal Party in the 1906 general election. The following July, days after his 70th birthday, Chamberlain suffered a stroke that paralysed his right side and ended his political career. He died in July 1914 and was buried in Keyhill Cemetery, Birmingham, after his family turned down the offer for him to be laid to rest in Westminster Abbey. \\"In Birmingham there are tributes to him, but the name of Joseph Chamberlain is not as famous as you would expect based on the colossal influence he had in his day,\\" said Patrick Burns. \\"I think to some extent it's the passage of time; partly it is because he never became prime minister and when people hear the Chamberlain name they think of his son Neville who did get to number 10.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"Joseph Chamberlain is an influential figure in British history who left a significant mark on the city of Birmingham through his investments and developments. Born in 1836 in Camberwell, London, Chamberlain entered the world of politics after achieving success in business, eventually becoming mayor of Birmingham in 1873 and then being elected as Liberal MP for the town in 1876.  During his tenure as mayor, Chamberlain oversaw a number of critical decisions. He purchased both the Birmingham and Staffordshire gas companies and spearheaded a hostile takeover of Birmingham Waterworks. By utilizing profits from the gas industry and public funds, Chamberlain launched a £1.75 million city improvement scheme in 1874 which led to the construction of libraries, schools, and swimming pools. His initiatives also resulted in the development of Corporation Street, featuring a Parisian boulevard-style roadway that replaced slum housing. Chamberlain's legacy is apparent throughout the city to this day, with landmarks such as the Victorian Law Courts on Corporation Street and Highbury Hall, his family home built in 1880, standing testament to his impact. Under his leadership, Birmingham was known as the best-governed city in the industrial world. His time as mayor ultimately propelled him onto the national political stage, culminating in his appointment as President of the Board of Trade in William Gladstone's government in 1880. Later, as colonial secretary in Lord Salisbury's government from 1895, Chamberlain focused on empire-building, working to raise the British Empire's prominence and power in response to growing rivalries with France, Germany, and the United States. However, his decision to resign and push for a scheme that would involve imposing taxes on foreign imports proved divisive, splitting the Conservative Party and leading to the Liberal Party's landslide victory in the 1906 general election.  In July 1907, at the age of 70, Chamberlain's political career came to an abrupt end following a stroke that left him paralyzed. He passed away in July 1914 but, despite his remarkable influence, his name is often overshadowed by his sons, Neville Chamberlain, who became Prime Minister, and Austen Chamberlain, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Solve 0 = -40*r + 4*r + 144 for r.","output":"To solve the equation 0 = -40*r + 4*r + 144 for r, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -40*r and 4*r are like terms since they both involve the variable r. We can combine them by adding them together: 0 = (-40*r + 4*r) + 144 0 = (-36*r) + 144 Step 2: Isolate the variable term, r. In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the constant term (144) on the right side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 144 from both sides: 0 - 144 = -36*r -144 = -36*r Step 3: Solve for r. Now we need to get r by itself. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient -36: -144 / -36 = (-36*r) / -36 4 = r So, the solution to the math problem is r = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: \\"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there.\\" His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of \\"the most recent eight songs that [he'd] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar\\" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was expecting only a deal for a seven-inch record.  Regarding the record, Smith said: \\"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed [Heatmiser], unfortunately.\\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \\"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest--Mudhoney and Nirvana--and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\\"  The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled \\"Kiwi Maddog 20/20\\" (a reference to the low-end fortified wine), had full band instrumentation.  One of Smith's first solo performances was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set being B-sides, Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. She later recorded one of his songs, \\"I Figured You Out\\", which he had discarded for sounding \\"too much like the Eagles\\".  The same year, Smith released a split 7\\" single with Pete Krebs, contributing the track \\"No Confidence Man\\" as the single's B-side.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was Roman candle an album?","output":"Yes, Roman Candle was an album.

After all, it wasn't like his life was that interesting. Sure, he came from a well-known family with an extensive history in the public eye, but he had made a conscious effort to stay out of the limelight and focus on what really mattered – his own goals, interests, and personal accomplishments. As he continued to avoid the persistent reporter, he began to wonder what it was about him that had garnered her attention in the first place. Was it the fact that he was the introverted, quieter member of the family? Or could it be that she had caught wind of a secret he had been keeping all these years? In either case, he knew that the best thing he could do was to maintain his distance and not give her the opportunity to find anything out. But as the days went by, the reporter only seemed more determined to corner him. He found himself growing both annoyed and impressed with her tenacity. It made him realize that perhaps there was more to her than just her job – she was genuinely passionate about uncovering the truth and getting to the heart of the stories she reported on. He had to admit, there was something almost admirable about that. It wasn't long until their paths crossed once again, and this time, she approached him with an unexpected proposition. \\"I know you're not interested in interviews or publicity,\\" she began cautiously, \\"But I was wondering if you might consider helping me with a different kind of project – something that I believe would mean a great deal to our community.\\" Curious, he couldn't help but ask her to elaborate. She explained that she had been working on an investigation into a local scandal that involved corruption, environmental destruction, and social injustices. She was confident that with his connections, expertise, and influence, he could play a crucial role in exposing the truth and bringing those responsible to justice. As she spoke, he couldn't deny the passion and conviction in her voice. It was evident that she truly cared about the issues she was researching, and he found himself wondering if perhaps this was the reason she had been so relentless in her pursuit of him. She saw a potential ally in him – someone who could make a real difference in the world. He considered her proposal carefully, weighing the potential risks and benefits. In the end, he made a decision that surprised even him – he agreed to help her with her investigation. It was time for him to step out of his family's shadow, and use his position for something more meaningful than just maintaining their public image. They quietly formed a partnership, working together to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and piece together the puzzle of the scandal. Despite the countless obstacles and challenges they faced during their investigation, their passion for justice and their determination to make a difference never wavered. They found a renewed sense of purpose in their work, and an unexpected friendship blossomed between them as they supported each other in their mission. In the end, their collaboration led to the exposure of the scandal, triggering a ripple effect of positive change throughout the community. They managed to shed light on the truth and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. The experience taught him that sometimes, even the most unlikely of partnerships could lead to the most remarkable of outcomes. It may have started with a reporter trying to dig up new information on him and his family, but it ended with them joining forces to make a real difference in their world. And although his decision to help her may have pulled him into the limelight he had so desperately tried to avoid, he knew that the impact they had made together was worth the exposure. And even as the cameras flashed and the reporters swarmed around them, he couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, he had found someone worth smiling prettily for and playing nice with. For in the midst of it all, he had discovered a friendship, a purpose, and a voice that he never knew he had."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently George Rutaganda, a friendly supplier to the hotel who also is the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia.As the political situation in the country deteriorates, Paul and his family observe neighbors being dragged from their homes and openly beaten in the streets.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses.

Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE.  According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures.  Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar.  The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: In what arenas were you able to witness the Odissi performers in the Medieval era?","output":"In the Medieval era, you were able to witness Odissi performers in Hindu temples.

News article: ‘Captain America’: Chris Evans says CG team ‘nailed it’ with frail Steve Rogers scenes Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers in \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" (Marvel) Chris Evans can’t stop wondering – what it would be like if you were a man lost in time? It’s a mental exercise that began on the London set of “Captain America: The First Avenger,” the film that reaches theaters on July 22 with a World War II setting and the tricky challenge of winning over young Internet-era audiences with a story of the radio-days past. “A great story is a great story no matter when it’s set,” said Evans, the 29-year-old actor who will wear the red, white and blue costume of a comic-book character that dates to 1941 and was shown punching Adolf Hitler on the cover of his first newsstand issue. For the screen, the core mythology of the hero’s origin remains in place: Steve Rogers (Evans), a sickly young man deemed unfit for combat duty, volunteers for a secret experiment that transforms him into the first of a “super solider” army — but a Nazi spy kills the scientist (Stanley Tucci) before the process can be duplicated. With his compatriot James “Bucky” Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the hero fights the good fight against Axis foes such as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) and Arnim Zola (Toby Jones). Director Joe Johnston has some specialized experience in retro adventure as the director of the underrated, serial-spirited “The Rocketeer” in 1991 and as the visual effects art director on Steven Spielberg’s “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” “When you sit down to watch it, it’s certainly not ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ which is a very different kind of film in the final analysis,” Johnston said. “But sometimes when we had questions and we were stuck we would say, ‘What would Indiana Jones do? What would be the answer to this in “Raiders of the Lost Ark”?’ I’ve always loved ‘Raiders’ and the great achievement of it was the tone and the fresh feeling of the movie. It was period but didn’t feel like it was made in the period. It felt like a contemporary film about this period in the past, and that is the goal we have with ‘Captain America.’ And I can say this — it definitely has an Indiana Jones pace.” The film will have some darker nuances to it – the character of Bucky is far more haunted than the vintage version from comic books, for instance, and Captain America chafes at the way his government handlers spin his public persona. Asked about his greatest concern, Evans conceded that he fretted a great deal about the CG-effects needed for the scenes showing Steve Rogers before his transformation. “If something like that isn’t done right, it takes you right out of the movie. You’re suddenly thinking, ‘Wow that doesn’t look real, look at that actor’ and it can really ruin it. And if it’s early in the movie it can undermine the whole way the audience connects with the story.” Evans knows that fans and bloggers zeroed in on the frail Rogers sequence in their criticism of the first trailer, but he said the ongoing visual-effects work is like a sculpting process and those scenes will deliver in the finished film. “They nailed it, it works, they really put a lot of time into it. It was a big relief for me.” The entire movie is like a puzzle piece in a larger picture. Evans is now on the set of “The Avengers,” the 2012 release that pulls his character into the modern day and teams him up with Iron Man, Thor and the Hulk. That has Evans pondering some Rip Van Winkle questions. “Just think about text messaging,” Evans said. “That’s the way I communicate with my friends now. If one them calls me I’m like, ‘Why didn’t you just text me?’ And that’s pretty new. Cellphones haven’t been around that long – I remember when people didn’t have them, really – and the Internet has totally changed the world in a relatively short period of time. Think of how strange all of it would be to someone from the 1940s who looks around and wonders what happened to all the things that were important to them.” Feige: Captain America as moral compass Johnston’s default: What would Indy do?

Entailment means that the truth of one sentence guarantees or implies the truth of another sentence. In this case, the meaning and the information conveyed by the first sentence imply the meaning of the second sentence. Let us examine both sentences more closely: Sentence 1: \\"Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank!\\" This sentence implies that someone might think that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort, but the speaker wants to clarify that, in reality, she is not a bad sort. The use of \\"not\\" and \\"really\\" in the sentence negates the idea that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort. It seems like the speaker is defending Mother Greenbank against a possible misconception or negative opinion about her character. The sentence emphasizes that there is more to understand about her character than what may initially meet the eye. Sentence 2: \\"Mother Greenbank isn't the bad sort.\\" In this sentence, you have a clearer and more direct negation of the idea that Mother Greenbank is a bad sort. The sentence straightforwardly states that she is not a bad sort, which is essentially the same information conveyed in the first sentence. Because both sentences convey the idea that Mother Greenbank is not a bad sort, it can be concluded that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Texas governor has challenged Nancy Pelosi to a mano-a-mano debate on his new part-time Congress proposal, which would halve Congress’ pay, the Hill reports. “I am in Washington Monday and would love to engage you in a public debate about my Overhaul Washington plan versus the congressional status quo,” he wrote in a letter. Pelosi hasn’t responded. Perry’s campaign is badly reeling from his grisly debate performances: His once-mighty fundraising operation is in freefall, the Houston Chronicle reports. One fundraiser, for example, says he had 15 donors lined up for an event—but after Perry’s \\"oops\\" moment, none showed up. Another fundraiser predicts Perry's Q4 haul will be between 3 million and 5 million—less than one-third of what the governor raked in during the first six weeks of his campaign. But Perry reported 15 million in the bank on Oct. 1—more than any other candidate—and that cash cushion could let him \\"stay in the game and make a comeback,\\" says one political scientist.","output":"Title: Rick Perry Challenges Nancy Pelosi to a Debate on His Part-Time Congress Proposal Despite his recent struggles in debates and declining fundraising operations, Texas Governor Rick Perry is eager to engage in another debate. However, this time he wants to take on Nancy Pelosi in a one-on-one public discussion about his proposal for a part-time Congress. This plan would cut Congress' pay in half, challenging the current congressional status quo. In a letter to Pelosi, Perry expressed his interest in the debate, writing, \\"I am in Washington Monday and would love to engage you in a public debate about my Overhaul Washington plan versus the congressional status quo.\\" As of now, Pelosi has not responded to the invitation.  The proposed Overhaul Washington plan by Perry aims at reducing the power of Congress and cutting its members' pay as a means to reform the institution. Perry believes a part-time Congress would save money and reduce the influence of special interest groups. In addition, the plan proposes a reduction in the amount of time members of Congress spend in session, arguing that this would force them to focus on the most important issues affecting the nation.  However, Perry's recent debate performances have been lackluster, leading to a significant decline in his popularity and support. The Houston Chronicle reports that his once-strong fundraising operation is now in freefall. One fundraiser noted that they had 15 donors lined up for an event, but after Perry's \\"oops\\" moment in a previous debate, not a single one showed up. This sudden dip in funds has led some to predict Perry's fourth-quarter haul will amount to only 3 million to 5 million, which is less than one-third of what he managed to secure during the first six weeks of his campaign.  Yet, Rick Perry remains optimistic. With 15 million in the bank at the beginning of October, he holds more cash than any other candidate. This sizable cash cushion could potentially allow Perry to \\"stay in the game and make a comeback,\\" according to one political scientist. By challenging Nancy Pelosi to a debate, Perry could also hope to regain credibility and support among potential donors and voters that have become disillusioned with his campaign due to his previous debate performances. The outcome of this proposed debate, if it takes place, remains to be seen. Should Pelosi accept Perry's challenge, it would provide a unique opportunity for the public to witness a clash of ideologies between an established Democrat and a Republican with a controversial proposal. Additionally, it would be a crucial moment for Perry to redeem himself in the eyes of his supporters and potentially steer his troubled campaign back on track."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first question seeks to identify the best Burberry trench coat, while the second question deals with how Burberry trench coats generally fit. Let's explore the answers to both questions in more detail. 1. What is the best Burberry trench coat? The best Burberry trench coat can be a matter of personal preference, as it depends on factors such as fit, color, style, and fabric composition. However, one iconic and highly-regarded Burberry trench coat is the \\"The Chelsea - Long Heritage Trench Coat.\\" This classic piece features a slim fit, weather-resistant gabardine fabric, a double-breasted front, and the brand's signature check lining.

How do Burberry trench coats fit? Burberry trench coats are known for their exceptional fit, but each style has its distinct characteristics concerning fit: - The Chelsea: The Chelsea is designed for a slim fit, which makes it ideal for those seeking a tailored, more streamlined silhouette. This trench coat is suitable for more formal occasions or wearing over a tailored suit. - The Kensington: The Kensington offers a regular fit, which means it is designed to accommodate a wider range of body shapes and sizes than the slimmer Chelsea. This style is versatile and can be worn on both casual and formal occasions. - The Westminster: The Westminster comes in a relaxed fit, allowing for additional room and comfort. This style is perfect for those who desire a more casual trench coat and prefer to wear it over thicker layers, such as sweaters or blazers. - The Sandringham: The Sandringham is the most fitted trench coat style. It is meant to hug the body closely, giving it a flattering, feminine silhouette. If you do not prefer a fitted style or plan to wear the coat over thick layers, you should consider choosing a different model or size up. Whichever style you choose, it is essential to consult the size guide provided on the Burberry website or at the store, as this will help ensure that you find the best fit for your body type and styling preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: What kind of a reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen?   A: A:","output":"A combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen. Combustion reactions are exothermic reactions, meaning they release energy in the form of heat and light. This type of reaction is commonly observed when a fuel burns in air or when a metal reacts with oxygen. A detailed explanation of combustion reactions: Combustion reactions involve the reaction of a substance with oxygen gas (O₂) to produce oxides and release energy. The process is usually rapid and generates a significant amount of heat and light in the form of a flame. The substances that participate in combustion reactions are typically hydrocarbons or other substances containing carbon, hydrogen, and sometimes other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. In a few cases, these reactions may involve non-organic compounds or metals. The general equation for a hydrocarbon combustion reaction is: CxHy + (x + y/4) O₂ → x CO₂ + (y/2) H₂O + energy In this equation, CxHy represents a hydrocarbon, where x and y denote the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms, respectively. When the hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen, it produces carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) as the products, along with the release of energy. A common example of combustion is the burning of methane (CH₄), the primary component of natural gas. The combustion reaction for methane can be represented as: CH₄ + 2 O₂ → CO₂ + 2 H₂O + energy Other examples of combustion reactions include the burning of gasoline in an internal combustion engine, the combustion of coal in a furnace, and the reaction of metal powders, such as magnesium or aluminum, with oxygen. Characteristics of combustion reactions: 1. Exothermic: Combustion reactions release a significant amount of energy in the form of heat and light. It is this energy release that makes combustion useful as a source of power, such as in engines or heaters. 2. Irreversible: Combustion reactions are generally considered to be irreversible, as the products, such as carbon dioxide and water, do not easily react to regenerate the original fuel. 3. Rapid: Combustion reactions usually proceed rapidly, evidenced by the production of a flame. The rate of the reaction depends on various factors, such as the fuel's reactivity, the presence of a catalyst, and the oxygen concentration. 4. Requires oxygen: Oxygen is a necessary component for combustion reactions, and the availability of oxygen in the surrounding environment plays a significant role in determining the rate, efficiency, and completeness of the reaction. In summary, among the given choices, a combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts quickly with oxygen. It is an exothermic and generally irreversible process that produces heat, light, and various oxide products. Combustion reactions play an essential role in various energy-generation processes and industrial applications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrodinger's work of 1926.

Here are the key phrases and their translations: - \\"Accommodation\\" = \\"Alojamiento\\" - \\"Old Orthodox Christmas\\" = \\"Antigua Navidad Ortodoxa\\" - \\"Covaci\\" = \\"Covaci\\" (proper noun, hence not translated) - \\"bed and breakfast\\" = \\"bed and breakfast\\" (commonly used in Spanish destinations, not translated) - \\"hostels\\" = \\"albergues\\" - \\"hotels\\" = \\"hoteles\\" - \\"villas\\" = \\"villas\\" (same in both languages) - \\"sorted by\\" = \\"ordenadas por\\" - \\"classification\\" = \\"clasificación\\" It's important to remember that the order of words can differ between languages, but in this case, the structure should be fairly straightforward to translate. In particular, Spanish often places adjectives after the noun they describe, which is why we say \\"Navidad Ortodoxa\\" instead of \\"Ortodoxa Navidad\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who wants to protect his daughter's virtue?  In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.  Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \\"gets it\\" (\\"The Rain in Spain\\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent (\\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\").

The latter part of the sentence explains that to resolve the problem, screws would be used as a better alternative to nails. Therefore, the complete sentence would be:  \\"The nails were coming out of the wood and needed to be replaced with screws, so the screws were inserted.\\" Screws provide a more secure hold and are less prone to coming out of the wood compared to nails due to their design, threading, and method of installation. Replacing nails with screws would help ensure the wood remains securely fastened, reducing the likelihood of future issues arising from loosening elements. Furthermore, screws offer a tighter grip on the wood's fibers, increasing structural stability and durability over time. This makes them the preferred choice in this context, reaffirming the correctness of the sentence ending with the insertion of screws as a solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards.

In New York he managed a sugar house on Pine Street before opening his own refinery on Vandam Street with his brother, Frederick Christian Havemeyer, who had come to New York in 1802. Together the two brothers operated the W. & F.C. Havemeyer Company sugar refineries, before passing the business on to their sons. His son William Frederick Havemeyer, retired from the sugar refining business in 1842 and entered politics, eventually serving three terms as Mayor of New York. In 1855 the family relocated their refineries to Brooklyn, where they remained as the business grew to acquire a commanding share of the United States sugar refining market under the leadership of Frederick's grandson, Henry Osborne Havemeyer. The Havemeyer refineries were incorporated as the American Sugar Refining Company in 1891 and became known as Domino Sugar in 1900.

Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks   between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk  . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it.

Question: Information:  - Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo ( 8 August 1736 -- August 1776 ) was an artist and son of the more famous Giovanni Battista Tiepolo . In 1750 , he travelled to Würzburg with his father and brother , Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo , where he worked alongside them on the decorative fresco cycle in the Würzburg Residence . A number of drawings have been attributed to him from these apprentice years .  - Johann Balthasar Neumann (27 January 1687 (?) 19 August 1753), usually known as Balthasar Neumann, was a German architect and military artillery engineer who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period, including the Würzburg Residence and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers (called \\"Vierzehnheiligen\\" in German).  - Johann Maximilian von Welsch (1671  15 October 1745) was a German architect, High Director of Building and fortress master builder.  - Fresco (plural frescos or frescoes) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly-laid, or wet lime plaster. Water is used as the vehicle for the pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco is derived from the Italian adjective \\"fresco\\" meaning \\"fresh\\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting.  - Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt (14 November 1668  16 November 1745) was an Austrian baroque architect and military engineer who designed stately buildings and churches and whose work had a profound influence on the architecture of the Habsburg Empire in the eighteenth century. After studying in Rome under Carlo Fontana, he constructed fortresses for Prince Eugene of Savoy during his Italian campaigns, becoming his favorite architect. In 1700 he became court engineer in Vienna, and in 1711 was named head of the court department of building. He became court architect in 1723. His designs for palaces, estates, gardens, churches, chapels, and villas were widely imitated, and his architectural principles spread throughout central and southeast Europe. Among his more important works are Palais Schwarzenberg, St. Peter's Church, and Belvedere in Vienna, Savoy Castle in Ráckeve, Schönborn Palace in Göllersdorf, and Schloss Hof.  - The Würzburg Residence (German: \\"Würzburger Residenz\\") is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building.   - Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (August 30, 1727March 3, 1804) was an Italian painter and printmaker in etching. He was the son of artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and elder brother of Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo.  - Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (March 5, 1696  March 27, 1770), also known as Gianbattista or Giambattista Tiepolo, was an Italian painter and printmaker from the Republic of Venice. He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain.  - Germain Boffrand (16 May 1667  19 March 1754) was a French architect. A pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, Germain Boffrand was one of the main creators of the precursor to Rococo called the \\" style Régence\\", and in his interiors, of the Rococo itself. In his exteriors he held to a monumental Late Baroque classicism with some innovations in spatial planning that were exceptional in France His major commissions, culminating in his interiors at the Hôtel de Soubise, were memorialised in his treatise \\"Livre d'architecture\\", published in 1745, which served to disseminate the French \\"Louis XV\\" style throughout Europe.  - Robert de Cotte (1656  15 July 1735) was a French architect-administrator, under whose design control of the royal buildings of France from 1699, the earliest notes presaging the Rococo style were introduced. First a pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, he later became his brother-in-law and his collaborator. After Hardouin-Mansart's death, de Cotte completed his unfinished projects, notably the royal chapel at Versailles and the Grand Trianon.    What entity does 'lorenzo baldissera tiepolo' has the relation 'languages spoken or written' with? Answer:","output":"There is no direct information available about the specific languages spoken or written by Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo. However, considering he was an Italian artist from the Republic of Venice, it can be assumed that he spoke and wrote in Italian. Also, since he traveled and worked in Germany alongside his father and brother, it is possible that he had some knowledge of the German language as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The men argue they have a due process right to have both officially recognized. The adoption was finalized in New York, but the child was born in Louisiana. An appeals court has ruled against the same-sex couple. Article:","output":"Title: Louisiana Denies Same-Sex Couple's Adoption Request for Amended Birth Certificate Introduction: A recent appeals court ruling in Louisiana has denied a same-sex couple the right to have both of their names listed as adoptive parents on their child's amended birth certificate. Despite having finalized the adoption in New York, where the couple resides, Louisiana's refusal to recognize the couple's rights raises questions about the state's stance on same-sex adoption and the violation of due process rights.  Step 1: Present the situation Two men, who legally adopted a child in the state of New York, requested an amended birth certificate from Louisiana, where the child was born. The couple argued that they had a due process right to have both names officially recognized on the birth certificate. Step 2: Discuss the denial and appeals process Louisiana officials, however, refused to issue an amended birth certificate listing both men as the adoptive parents. The couple then took the matter to the court system, hoping to have their rights affirmed through the legal process. The case eventually reached an appeals court, which ruled against the same-sex couple. The court's decision effectively denies the couple's request for an amended birth certificate and prevents them from having both names recognized on a legal document tied to their child's birth. Step 3: Highlight potential implications and impacts This ruling brings attention to the ongoing challenges faced by same-sex couples when it comes to adoption and recognition of parental rights. It also raises questions about whether Louisiana will continue to refuse recognition of same-sex couples' rights, even when these rights are legally granted in another state. The refusal to issue an amended birth certificate with both adoptive parents' names may not only have emotional implications for this specific couple but may also present real-life logistical challenges, as birth certificates are often required for various purposes such as enrollment in schools or obtaining a passport. Step 4: Discuss the larger context of same-sex adoption rights in the U.S. While same-sex marriage has been legalized across the United States, there are still issues and inconsistencies surrounding same-sex adoption rights and recognition in different states. This case in Louisiana serves as a reminder that progress still needs to be made in order to ensure equal rights and recognition for all families, regardless of their makeup. Conclusion: The recent appeals court ruling in Louisiana highlights the ongoing challenges that same-sex couples face in adoption cases. As more states continue to recognize and protect same-sex couples' rights, there is hope for progress towards equal legal recognition for all loving families. However, cases like this one emphasize that there is still work to be done in addressing the legal disparities faced by same-sex couples and their families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The satellite is pulled past the asteroid and into the orbit of the moon due to the moon's much larger size. This means that the (A) moon (B) asteroid has a more powerful gravitational attraction. Answer:","output":"The given scenario involves a satellite that is initially heading toward the moon to orbit and gather data. Along its path, it encounters an asteroid that has less than half the mass of the moon. Despite the presence of the asteroid, the satellite is pulled past it and proceeds to orbit the moon. This occurrence provides insight into the gravitational forces at play between the three celestial objects: the satellite, the moon, and the asteroid. Gravitational force is the attractive force that exists between two masses. The strength of this force depends on two factors: the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Here, F represents the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. In this specific scenario, the satellite is attracted to both the moon and the asteroid due to their masses. However, the gravitational force exerted by the moon on the satellite is more substantial than that exerted by the asteroid because the moon is significantly larger in size and mass. Consequently, the satellite gets pulled past the asteroid and ultimately enters the orbit of the moon. Given these observations, it becomes evident that the moon (option A) has a more powerful gravitational attraction than the asteroid (option B). This conclusion is based on the moon's considerably greater mass compared to the asteroid, making it the dominant gravitational influence on the satellite's trajectory. In conclusion, the satellite's trajectory being influenced more by the moon's gravitational force confirms that the moon possesses a stronger gravitational attraction than the asteroid it encountered en route. This is primarily due to the moon's much larger size and mass, which results in a greater gravitational force acting on the satellite."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These cleaners are relatively effective on wheels, and they can make it fast and easy to detail your black rims. Also, you'll need several microfiber cloths throughout the process.  Look for one that says \\"waterless\\" on the bottle, such as Chemical Guys Waterless Car Wash and Wax. Consider getting black, edgeless microfiber cloths. Because they are edgeless, they are less likely to scratch your rims. Waterless cleaners can be used on any kind of rim. However, make sure it is safe for the type of finish you have, which is most likely a painted aluminum alloy. You don't want to use anything harder than you'd use on your car's finish. The rim needs to be covered in the cleaner as you start cleaning it. Spray it down well. It doesn't need to be dripping off, but the whole surface of the rim needs to have the cleaner on it so it can start breaking down the gunk. Using the microfiber cloth, rub the rim down. Make sure to get in all the nooks and crannies to get all the dirt out. Rub both the spokes and the inside edges of the wheels, as it can all get dirty from road debris and brake dust.

Options：  A. hop garden  B. wasteland  C. parking lot  D. sand dune  E. desert Answer:","output":"E. desert Explanation:  1. The first step in solving this task involves understanding the question and looking for any important details that can guide us in choosing the correct option. The question says, \\"It was a stunning sight to the explorer, the garden oasis in the middle of the what was the most beautiful thing he had seen?\\" Indicating that the explorer saw a 'garden oasis' in the middle of somewhere unusual. 2. The second step is to analyze the options given. The term 'oasis' is the key here, it refers to a fertile spot in a desert where water is found. So, this narrows down our choices to options related to places where you wouldn't usually find a garden.  3. From our options: A. hop garden, B. wasteland, C. parking lot, D. sand dune, E. desert - all of them aside from hop garden are unusual places for a garden. However, considering the term 'oasis', the most fitting reply would be an environment that is generally barren and lacks vegetation. 4. Finally, if we look at the options from that perspective, option E. desert becomes the most appropriate answer. This is because an oasis is typically found in a desert and it would clearly be a stunning sight to see a lush oasis in the middle of a barren desert, making it the \\"most beautiful thing\\" the explorer had seen."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  Please answer this question : Which city contributed less to marine pollution? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bird city contributed less to marine pollution. Step-by-step justification: 1. Pine city is located in the mountains and is inhabited by nature lovers and environmental protectors. This suggests that the people of Pine city are more conscious of their actions and its impact on the environment, making them less likely to contribute to marine pollution. 2. Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. This means that any pollution generated by Bird city has a higher likelihood of ending up in the ocean through the river. 3. Bird city relies mainly on conventional agriculture and uses fertilizers for their crops. When these fertilizers are improperly managed or used in excess, they can runoff into the river and eventually make their way into the sea, contributing to marine pollution (as explained in the hint provided). 4. Marine pollution is caused by potentially hazardous chemicals or particles entering the ocean, and rivers are one of the main sources of such pollution. In this situation, Bird city's activities and location have a larger impact on marine pollution than Pine city.

Answer the question...who wrote the jazz classic i got rhythm??","output":"\\"I Got Rhythm\\" is a jazz classic written by the iconic American composer and lyricist George Gershwin. Born on September 26, 1898, George Gershwin was a prolific musician in a family of musicians. His brother, Ira Gershwin, was a talented lyricist, and together they produced numerous compositions that significantly contributed to the American songbook. \\"I Got Rhythm\\" originally appeared as a fast-paced, orchestral piece in a 1930 musical called \\"Girl Crazy\\". The lyrics for this song were penned by Ira Gershwin, George's brother. The show, which starred Ethel Merman, Ginger Rogers, and Bert Lahr, was a commercial success. The song grew in popularity and took on a life of its own outside the context of the musical, thanks in large part to its catchy melody and energetic tempo, which seemed to epitomize the spirit of the jazz age. The song's signature elements include its repeated syncopated opening motif, chromatic harmonies, and upbeat, danceable rhythms. The lyrics of \\"I Got Rhythm\\" celebrate the feelings of happiness, exuberance, and carefree living, which perfectly match the musical style. \\"I Got Rhythm\\" has been performed and reinterpreted by many artists and ensembles through the years, ranging from popular singers like Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra to American jazz legends like Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. The song was also adapted into a set of variations for solo piano by George Gershwin himself in 1933, titled \\"I Got Rhythm Variations,\\" which became a popular performance piece among classical pianists. George Gershwin's contribution to the world of music, particularly in jazz and popular American song, cannot be overstated. Tragically, he passed away at the young age of 38 in 1937, but his timeless creations, like \\"I Got Rhythm,\\" continue to inspire and entertain audiences around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: go to work, needed to pick up the papers for their paper route, needed to learn to ride a bike Answer:","output":"Kendall was riding their bicycle on the street at 7 AM on Monday morning, and there could be various reasons for this. Considering the given context and possible answers, there are three potential motivations behind Kendall's early morning bike ride: going to work, needing to pick up the papers for their paper route, or learning to ride a bike. 1. Going to work: One possible reason that Kendall was riding their bicycle at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they were commuting to work. Many people choose to ride their bikes as a mode of transportation for their daily commute for several reasons, including cost efficiency, environmental concerns, and health benefits. With the increasing popularity of cycling to work, it could very well be that Kendall was headed to their job on this Monday morning. Cycling to work has several advantages such as reduced expenses on gas, vehicle maintenance, and parking fees. Besides, cycling can help reduce one's carbon footprint and contribute to a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle. Additionally, incorporating physical activity into routine, such as biking to work, promotes better cardiovascular health, burning calories, and building muscle strength, which can help in maintaining overall well-being. 2. Picking up the papers for their paper route: Another possible explanation for Kendall riding their bike at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they needed to pick up the newspapers for their paper route. Early morning hours are a common time for paper carriers to distribute newspapers to customers, ensuring that they have the latest news and information at the start of their day. Being a paper carrier generally requires the individual to work early mornings, as they need to deliver the newspapers before most people begin their day. Riding a bike is a convenient method of transportation for this job, as it allows for easy navigation through neighborhoods, quick stops at each customer's home, and a more environmentally-friendly approach to the task. 3. Learning to ride a bike: A third potential reason that Kendall opted for cycling at 7 AM on a Monday morning is that they were learning to ride a bike. Early morning hours tend to have less traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, allowing for a more comfortable and less stressful environment for someone learning to ride. As a beginner cyclist, choosing a less busy time of day to practice riding is beneficial as it provides the opportunity to become familiar with bike handling and basic traffic rules without the added pressure of heavy traffic or large groups of pedestrians. Additionally, learning to ride a bike early in the day can create a sense of accomplishment and motivation that may positively influence the rest of Kendall's day. In conclusion, considering the given context, Kendall's decision to ride their bicycle at 7 AM on a Monday morning could be attributed to any of the three possible answers - going to work, picking up papers for their paper route, or learning to ride a bike. Each of these scenarios suggests Kendall's engagement in responsible, environmentally-conscious, or self-improvement activities, all of which positively reflect their character and priorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies). Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine. The two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, and finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas. As the tribesmen submit to him, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. They are pursued by Bockner and Dogati, who attack the village in full force. They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then kills all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party. Inside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost.

Summarize: In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work. She will highlight research that shows vacant posts are not being filled and gaps in rotas are being seen. It comes as ministers are locked in a dispute with junior doctors over their plans for improving weekend care. Last week thousands of medics went on strike over the government's decision to impose a new contract on them, designed to make it cheaper to rota on staff at weekends. Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands. Physicians are doctors who focus on diagnosis and treatment as opposed to surgery. They cover a whole range of areas including stroke and heart disease to the care of the elderly. Research by the RCP showed last year there were just over 13,000 consultant physicians across the UK - one in four of all consultants. But four in 10 vacant posts advertised last year went unfilled, while one in five consultants reported gaps in their junior doctor rotas. Meanwhile, one in 10 consultants say they often have to carry out junior jobs to ensure patients' care is not harmed. Prof Dacre will tell delegates: \\"I feel sorry for NHS trusts, I really do. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them. \\"If we have neither enough trainees nor consultants to run the service now, how are we going to implement a safe seven-day service?\\" She will go on to set out the case for extra funding, pointing out hospitals are racking up deficits and that funding lags behind other countries such as France and Germany. \\"It is time to revisit our national contribution to healthcare,\\" she will say. But a Department of Health spokeswoman pointed out extra money was being invested during this Parliament - Â£8bn more by 2020. She said this would help \\"make sure the right staff and support is available to create a safe NHS seven days a week\\".

This comes amid an ongoing dispute between ministers and junior doctors over the government's plans to improve weekend care. Last year, research by the RCP showed that four in ten vacant posts advertised went unfilled, and one in five consultants reported gaps in junior doctor rotas. Professor Dacre will emphasize the need for extra funding and express concerns over the implementation of a safe seven-day service given the lack of trainees and consultants available.

Movie title: The Stuff Context: Several railroad workers discover a yogurt-like white alien substance bubbling out of the ground. It's found to be sweet and addictive. Later, the substance is marketed as \\"The Stuff,\\" and it's being sold to the general public in containers like ice cream. It is marketed as having no calories and as being sweet, creamy, and filling. The Stuff quickly becomes a nationwide craze and drastically hurts the sales of ice cream. Former FBI agent turned industrial saboteur David \\"Mo\\" Rutherford is hired by the leaders of the suffering ice cream industry, as well as junk food mogul Charles W. \\"Chocolate Chip Charlie\\" Hobbs, to find out exactly what The Stuff is and destroy it. His efforts reveal that the craze for the dessert is far deadlier and much more evil than anyone had believed: The Stuff is actually a living, parasitic, and possibly sentient organism that gradually takes over the brainâmutating those who eat it into bizarre zombie-like creatures, before consuming them from the inside and leaving them empty shells of their former selves. A young boy named Jason also discovers The Stuff is alive and sees how it affects his family and how they are adamant towards his beliefs on The Stuff. He gets arrested for vandalizing a supermarket display of The Stuff, attracting the attention of Rutherford, who comes to his aid. Rutherford also manages to charm Nicole, an advertising executive who becomes his partner and lover when she sees the effect of The Stuff. The trio infiltrates the distribution operation, which is actually an organized corporate effort to spread The Stuff on the basis of eliminating world hunger, and destroy the lake of The Stuff with explosives. Meanwhile, United States Army Col.

It was commissioned by Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald in August following the political row over the murder of Kevin McGuigan in Belfast. She said there was \\"very substantial common ground\\" with the assessment carried out in Northern Ireland. She added: \\"Most importantly, there is a common assessment of the reality of the security threat posed by PIRA.\\" Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said that while the IRA's ruling body, the 'army council', still exists, it has a \\"wholly political focus\\". In the Garda report, it said there was \\"no evidence of a Provisional Army Council, in the generally accepted sense, meeting or functioning in this jurisdiction\\". \\"There is evidence that a type of 'residual leadership', committed to peaceful means, continues to exist and has become involved from time to time in dealing with 'legacy' issues,\\" it said.

She said they \\"make full use of the reputations which they acquired as members of PIRA and do not hesitate to use their previous terror tactics\\". The head of police in the Republic of Ireland, Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan, said its findings \\"remain consistent with our previous assessments\\" and those of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC), a paramilitary activity watchdog that issued its last report in 2011 before being wound down. \\"It was never the position of the IMC - nor has it been the position of (Republic of Ireland police service) An Garda Siochana - that PIRA had disbanded and, accordingly, ceased to exist,\\" she said. \\"But the issues surrounding the continuing existence of PIRA are inevitably complex.\\" Ms O'Sullivan said it was \\"noteworthy that there is no evidence that there has been any recruitment to PIRA in recent years\\". She added: \\"I should mention that the assessment deals essentially with security issues and involvement in organised crime. \\"You will be aware that there are separate criminal investigations under way in relations to sexual abuse by PIRA members.\\" The Garda report said that since November 2010, 70 people had been charged before the Republic of Ireland's non-jury Special Criminal Court with terrorist related offences. No-one investigated or charged was affiliated to PIRA when they were arrested, the report said Thirty three of those charged had past associations with the Provisional IRA at the time of arrest before defecting to dissident republican groups. It said that during the time that the Provisional IRA was \\"engaged in what it called armed conflict\\", a substantial element of its activity in the Republic of Ireland concerned logistical support. It said there was no evidence of any so-called military departments currently in operation in the jurisdiction. However, it said there was clear evidence that a significant number of persons who have been associated with PIRA remain criminally active, particularly in organised crime, and continue to associate together\\". \\"They make full use of their 'legacy' reputations and in some cases their former terrorist tactics,\\" it said. The report said there was no evidence that this was directed by the leadership of the organisation or was for anything other than personal gain. It said the Criminal Assets Bureau, a body set up to seize cash, property and other assets of suspected criminals, had since 1996 seized 28m euros from more than 50 individuals who have had connections or associations to PIRA in the past.

Possible A: full of people, safety, lie, secure, being safe  Why is \\"secure\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Secure\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because of the following reasons: 1. Situation analysis: In the question, the soldiers are on the run and in danger, which implies that they are seeking a safe place to protect themselves from potential threats. 2. Decision-making process: When selecting a location for temporary refuge or protection, considering whether the building is secure or not is essential. A secure building would provide better protection and safety for the soldiers. 3. Elimination of other choices: Looking at the other possible answers – \\"full of people,\\" \\"safety,\\" \\"lie,\\" and \\"being safe\\" – we can deduce that \\"secure\\" is the most appropriate option. - \\"Full of people\\" might not necessarily mean a safe place, as it could increase the risk of detection or harm to bystanders. - \\"Safety\\" and \\"being safe\\" are abstract concepts and do not directly refer to the quality of the building itself. - \\"Lie\\" is unrelated to the question and does not make sense in this context. 4. Alignment with human reasoning: When people think about what they would do in a similar situation, seeking a secure or well-protected location would likely be a top priority. Therefore, the answer \\"secure\\" aligns with human common sense as the soldiers would naturally want to ensure the building offers protection and minimizes potential threats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which professional football club known as \\"the Red Devils\\" did Ernie Hine play for? A:","output":"Ernie Hine, full name Ernest Hine, was an accomplished English footballer who played as a forward during the early to mid-20th century. He is best known for his time with the professional football club Manchester United, which is fondly referred to as \\"the Red Devils,\\" a nickname that was adopted in the 1960s. Born on November 7, 1901, in the village of Netherfield, England, Hine began his professional football career with the team Notts County F.C. It wasn't until he signed with Manchester United in the late 1920s, however, that his career truly took off. As a talented and tenacious forward, Hine made his mark on the club and became a standout player during his time with the Red Devils. Ernie Hine joined Manchester United on October 31, 1928, from Leicester City for a transfer fee of £3,750, which was a significant amount at the time. He played for Manchester United between 1928 and 1934, during which he made 122 appearances and scored a remarkable 52 goals. Hine was an unwavering performer who was highly regarded for his physical strength and massive presence on the field, which earned him the reputation as a prolific goal scorer. One of the highlights of Hine's career with Manchester United was during the 1929-1930 season, when he scored a total of 19 goals in 28 league matches, making him the team's top goal scorer for that season. Additionally, during the 1930-1931 season, Hine nearly matched his previous year's tally by netting a commendable 18 goals in 28 league matches. Beyond his prowess as a goal scorer, Hine was also known for his exceptional passing and crossing skills, adding immense value to the team's overall performance. Unfortunately, Ernie Hine's time with the Red Devils was marred by Manchester United's irregular performance which saw the club experiencing both victorious and challenging times. During their dark period, Manchester United found themselves facing relegation from Division One to Division Two during the 1930-1931 season. Hine persisted with the club, and in 1932, the team managed to bounce back and secure a place in Division One. He played for Manchester United until 1934 when he returned back to Notts County F.C. to play out the final years of his career. In conclusion, Ernie Hine was a prominent player for Manchester United, famously known as \\"the Red Devils.\\" He made significant contributions to the club in terms of goals and performances. His dedication, talent, and skillset provided immense value to the team during a turbulent period in their history. Hine remains an important figure in the annals of Manchester United's storied past, and his contributions to the club's legacy are still fondly remembered today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What does a judge do when someone is convicted of a crime?  Here are possible answers to this question: - conduct trial - arrest - bring in verdict - pass sentence - serve justice  I believe the correct choice is \\"pass sentence\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"When someone is convicted of a crime, the primary responsibility of a judge is to \\"pass sentence,\\" which involves determining the appropriate punishment for the convicted individual based on the nature of the crime, legal guidelines, and other relevant factors. This choice accurately represents the primary role of a judge at this stage in the criminal justice process. Here's a detailed explanation of why this answer is correct: 1. Conduct trial: While it's true that a judge plays a crucial role in conducting a trial, this answer choice doesn't exactly capture the specific action a judge takes when someone has already been convicted of a crime. The judge's role during the trial is to preside and ensure that due process is followed, but once a conviction occurs, their responsibility shifts to passing sentence. 2. Arrest: The arrest of a suspect is carried out by law enforcement officers, not a judge. A judge might issue an arrest warrant at the request of a prosecutor or the police, which authorizes law enforcement officers to arrest a suspect, but this is separate from sentencing a convicted individual. 3. Bring in verdict: The verdict is typically determined by the jury in a jury trial, or the judge in a bench trial (also known as a trial by judge). The verdict is the final decision on whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty based on the evidence presented during the trial. This stage usually precedes sentencing and is distinct from the judge's role in determining a punishment after a conviction. 4. Pass sentence: This answer choice is the most accurate description of what a judge does when someone is convicted of a crime. The process of passing sentence consists of a judge reviewing the facts of the case, the severity of the crime, relevant laws, and legal guidelines for sentencing. The judge may also consider various factors, such as the defendant's criminal history, character, and potential for rehabilitation. After thorough consideration, the judge determines and pronounces the appropriate punishment for the convicted individual, which could range from fines and community service to probation, imprisonment, or even the death penalty in certain cases. 5. Serve justice: This answer choice is too general to capture the specific action taken by a judge when someone is convicted of a crime. While \\"serving justice\\" might encompass the overall objective of a judge's role in the criminal justice system, it doesn't provide a clear description of the particular action performed by a judge after a conviction. In summary, a judge's primary responsibility when someone is convicted of a crime is to \\"pass sentence,\\" determining the appropriate punishment for the individual based on the specifics of the case, relevant laws, and other factors. This particular action is crucial to ensuring that justice is served and that the convicted person receives a punishment that aligns with established legal norms and societal values."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Possible A: practice, dexterity, idle time, knowledge of music, conductor  Why is \\"knowledge of music\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Knowledge of music\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it addresses the situation described in the question and suggests a reasonable cause for the observed behavior.  Step 1: Understand the context of the question - The question describes someone who is fiddling through a music book when they should be playing. Step 2: Relate the context to the possible answers - A person's behavior in this scenario can be affected by various factors, such as practice, dexterity, idle time, knowledge of music, and the conductor. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of each possible answer - Practice: The lack of practice could be a reason for not being able to play properly, making it a relevant answer. - Dexterity: The lack of dexterity could hinder someone's ability to play, making it a relevant answer. - Idle time: Idle time is not directly related to the behavior mentioned in the question and may not be associated with the person's ability to play. - Knowledge of music: Someone who lacks knowledge of music might struggle to play the music correctly and may need to refer to the music book more frequently. This makes it a relevant answer aligned with human common sense. - Conductor: The conductor's presence or absence might affect the overall performance but is not necessarily the main reason for the person's behavior in this scenario. In conclusion, \\"knowledge of music\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it logically connects the person's behavior (fiddling through a music book) to their possible lack of understanding or familiarity with the music they are supposed to play."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I appreciate how biking to work allows me to be outside for at least a small part of my day. I'm a senior program director. If I didn't bike to work, I'd spend my weekdays almost entirely indoors--underground tunnel. On the bike, I get trees, air and a great way to get to know city neighborhoods. Of course, I also get bad weather and city traffic. But it's worth the trade-off. The weather's not often bad, and rain and snow have their charms. I've been cycling to work since the late 1990s. I started when the city was doing some construction in the subways and rerouting passengers, which would have lengthened my trip considerably. I tried riding my sister- in- law's bike to work one day and liked it, so I bought my own. Even though I hadn't biked since I was a child, I got back into it right away. I bike during all four seasons. In summer, I wear shorts and a T- shirt and carry a messenger bag over my shoulder for my lunch and anything else I need. Once at the office, I change into business- casual clothes. In winter, I wear layers and a thin hat under my helmet. A cold winter day can be the best time to be on a bicycle. When the air is clear, free of oppressive summer haze, the city can look beautiful. Biking to work also _ during the workday itself. I have a rack   on the back of my bike that accommodates panniers that allow me to pick up groceries. During work hours, a colleague will occasionally need to send or retrieve documents by messenger. If I have the time, I volunteer. Pedaling 30 blocks and back is a nice way to take a break from work--and to save the office a few bucks on messenger fees. I'm sure that some people thinking my mode of transportation might be afraid of Midtown traffic. I'm no hero; I don't want to get hurt riding to work. It just takes time getting used to it. There's a risk, but all travel has risks. They're worth it to me. Question: What made the author began to ride a bike to work? Options: A: The author bought his own bike.

Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Hardaway's most productive years came in his days as a member of the Orlando Magic as well as the early portion of his stint with the Phoenix Suns. Hardaway often was compared to Magic Johnson during his tenure because both had incredible size and quickness at the point guard position. Hardaway was an All-NBA player early in his career, but was plagued by constant injuries which gradually reduced his effectiveness.

This exciting news has drawn the world's attention, and it is a symbol of the ever-evolving British monarchy. As the nation prepares for the highly anticipated celebration, we take a closer look at the couple's relationship and what we can expect from this transatlantic union. A Whirlwind Romance The couple began dating last year and despite the challenges of a long-distance relationship, with Prince Harry in the United Kingdom and Meghan Markle in Toronto, their love has only grown stronger. They made their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games in Toronto in September, and rumors of a royal engagement were quick to follow. In a statement from Kensington Palace, it was announced that the couple became engaged in London earlier this month. Prince Harry has already informed his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and other close members of his family. The palace also confirmed that Prince Harry sought and received the blessing of Meghan Markle’s parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, who are delighted by the engagement. A Spring Wedding While many details surrounding the wedding are yet to be disclosed, NBC News reports that the royal nuptials will take place in the spring of 2018. The wedding venue has not been revealed, but Kensington Palace has assured the public that more information will be released in \\"due course.\\" This marks a new chapter in the British monarchy's history — a union between a British prince and an American bride. The Bride-to-Be Meghan Markle, 36, grew up in the Los Angeles area. She is best known for her role as Rachel Zane in the popular TV series \\"Suits.\\" In addition to her acting career, Markle is an outspoken advocate for gender equality and a Global Ambassador for World Vision Canada, working to help improve the lives of children around the world. Her parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, released a statement expressing their joy for their daughter’s engagement, saying, \\"Meghan has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.\\" Interestingly, one of Markle’s ancestors was beheaded almost 500 years ago on the orders of one of Prince Harry's forebears. From Toronto to London Following their marriage, the couple will reside in London, contrary to initial speculation that they might settle in Toronto, where Ms. Markle is currently based. Prince Harry, 33, is fifth in line to the British throne, and this move will signify the beginning of Meghan Markle's new life as a member of the British royal family. Conclusion This royal wedding marks a significant moment in the history of the British monarchy, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's love story transcends borders and captures the hearts of millions around the world. As we eagerly await the spring nuptials, their union serves as a testament to the power of love and the ever-evolving nature of the esteemed British monarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Revolver Movie plot: Jake Green (Jason Statham) is in prison in solitary confinement for seven years. He has two mysterious characters serving solitary in cells on either side of him (one a con man, the other a chess master). While in solitary, Jake and the other two exchange thoughts on chess and the perfect con via handwritten messages slipped inside of provisional books that the three share. Jake comes to learn the makings of a perfect con, but never fully grasps its depth and relevancy to him until much, much later. In the course of these exchanges, Jake reveals a lot about himself to the other two. Jake never meets these two men face to face. The two prisoners plan to break out of prison and agree to break Jake out as well. The next day, the two escape, leaving Jake behind. He feels cheated.Jake remains in prison while the two escaped convicts steal all the money Jake had hidden \\"on the outside\\". They trusted Jake with the formula; Jake trusted them as to the whereabouts of his money...a LOT of money. They take the money, leaving in its place, a message on a card:The first rule of any game - YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Cut to two years later.When Jake gets out of prison, broke and penniless, he starts to practice what he understands of the formula and of the con he learned from his time in solitary. Its very successful and he does very well in world of gambling, he seemingly learned a valuable lesson from the two conmen inside.Once Jake is up on his feet again (financially speaking), he takes on his nemesis the power hungry Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Jake enters Macha's casino with his brothers in tow, and is swiftly summoned before Macha to play a game of chance. En route to Macha's game, they must take an elevator up 22 floors, where it is revealed Jake suffers from extreme claustrophobia following his years in solitary, and must suppress an anxiety attack to make the journey. At the game, Jake beats him in a game of chance, humiliating Macha. Fearing more of the same, Macha wants revenge and... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Revolver,\\" the three Eddies are not explicitly sent to Billy's house by one single character, but rather, their presence at his house can be attributed to the series of events and manipulations orchestrated by the two mysterious characters in prison, Mr. Gold, and ultimately by the nature of the con itself. These characters enable the chain of events that eventually lead the Eddies to Billy's house. As the movie unfolds, it becomes clear that the larger con is not just about teaching Jake a lesson or taking his money, but also about revealing deeper truths about his own instincts, motivations, and fears. The complexities within this con make it difficult to pinpoint one character responsible for the Eddies' presence at Billy's house because this outcome is an inevitable part of the ongoing manipulation and power struggles between all the players involved. When the two mysterious prisoners escape and take Jake's money, they unknowingly trigger a thirst for vengeance and retribution within Jake. As he embarks on his journey to play Dorothy Macha, he's inadvertently playing into the bigger con orchestrated by these characters. The deeper he gets, the more entangled with crime lords, hired killers, and loan sharks he becomes, which increases the probability of encountering dangerous individuals like the three Eddies. Furthermore, Mr. Gold, the underlying antagonist representing the deceptive nature of power and control within the movie, can also be seen as responsible for the Eddies' presence in Billy's house. As Jake continues to play the con, he unknowingly allows Mr. Gold's hold on him to strengthen, furthering the chaos and unpredictability of the situation. Therefore, it's not a single, identifiable character who sends the three Eddies to Billy's house; rather, it's the intricate web of manipulation, desire for power, and human emotion that the entire con is built upon. Their presence is a result of the escalating chain of events and is fueled by the mind games played between the central characters in the story. In conclusion, while the three Eddies' arrival at Billy's house is not the direct doing of a single character, it is made possible by the combined machinations of the main players. Their presence is a consequence of the ongoing con, mind games, and power struggles in the complex world of \\"Revolver.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878. By 1977, it had appeared in an additional 18 languages. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did Bronn do in his translation that went completely against what Darwin wanted in On the Origin of Species?","output":"Heinrich Georg Bronn's translation of Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" into German went against Darwin's intentions in several ways: 1. Imposing his own ideas: Bronn introduced his own interpretations and ideas into the translation, going beyond his role as a translator and effectively modifying Darwin's original text. This included the addition of controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately left out or chosen not to discuss in-depth. 2. Altering phrases and concepts: Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races,\\" which potentially skewed the meaning of Darwin's original work. This change could have suggested a greater degree of finality and superiority in certain species, which was not in line with Darwin's emphasis on the constant process of natural selection and adaptation. 3. Adding essays and chapters: Bronn's translation included essays on topics such as the origin of life and the religious implications of Darwin's theory. These additions were partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie, a philosophical approach that applied metaphysical principles to the study of nature. These essays were not part of Darwin's original work and introduced new ideas that Darwin may not have agreed with or wanted to include. 4. Second edition issues: Although Bronn produced a second German edition based on the third English edition and included Darwin's suggested additions, he passed away shortly after its publication due to a heart attack. This left the German translation in a potentially unpolished state and may have resulted in inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the text. In summary, Bronn went against Darwin's intentions in his translation of \\"On the Origin of Species\\" by introducing his own ideas and themes, altering concepts and phrases, and adding essays and chapters not present in the original work. This led to a German translation that deviated significantly from Darwin's intended meaning and subsequently required revisions in later editions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Helen Wells (1910-1986) wrote volumes #1-7 and 17-27, and Julie Campbell Tatham (1908-1999), the creator of Trixie Belden, wrote volumes #8-16. Wells also created the Vicki Barr series. During World War II, the series encouraged girls to become nurses as a way to aid the war effort. \\"Cherry Ames\\" original editions are prized by collectors and fans. The series generated a few spin-off items, including a Parker Brothers board game; some titles have been reprinted.  - Lesbian pulp fiction is a genre of lesbian literature that refers to any mid-20th century paperback novel or pulp magazine with overtly lesbian themes and content. Lesbian pulp fiction was published in the 1950s and 60s by many of the same paperback publishing houses that other genres of fiction including westerns, romances, and detective fiction. Because very little other literature was available for and about lesbians at this time, quite often these books were the only reference the public (lesbian and otherwise) had for modeling what lesbians were. Stephanie Foote, from the University of Illinois commented on the importance of lesbian pulp novels to the lesbian identity prior to feminism: \\"Pulps have been understood as signs of a secret history of readers, and they have been valued because they have been read. The more they are read, the more they are valued, and the more they are read, the closer the relationship between the very act of circulation and reading and the construction of a lesbian community becomes...Characters use the reading of novels as a way to understand that they are not alone.\\"  - Sebastian Charles Faulks CBE (born 20 April 1953) is a British novelist, journalist and broadcaster.

Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.

Może być to coś, co przypomina taką amebę.","output":"What this task is asking: You're asked to translate a sentence written in Polish into English. Guidelines given: You haven't been given specific guidelines about how to do this translation. However, translating sentences generally involves understanding the meaning of the sentence as a whole, rather than translating word-by-word. It's useful to understand the context in which the sentence is used. Solution: The English translation of the Polish sentence \\"Może być to coś, co przypomina taką amebę.\\" is \\"It can be something that resembles such an amoeba.\\" Explanation of the process: In order to provide the translation, I used my knowledge of Polish grammar and vocabulary. Sentence by sentence translation was done to ensure the accuracy of the meaning and intention of the sentence. The words were translated individually while keeping an eye on the overall context to make sure the sentence flows naturally in English. Polish grammar rules are different from those in English, so I also adjusted the sentence structure to match English norms.  For example, in Polish, the adjective \\"taką\\" comes after the noun it describes \\"amebę\\", whereas in English we would usually put the adjective (in this case \\"such\\") before the noun it describes \\"an amoeba\\". Hence the translated English sentence \\"It can be something that resembles such an amoeba.\\" makes sense in English."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So the woman on the table next to me looks awfully familiar , but I ca n't place her until I hear here talking to the therapist about skating and rink time and all that . Answer the following question: Why did I think the woman was familiar ?","output":"Step 1: Read and understand the user's story. In the given story, the user is at physical therapy and mentions that everyone works in the same big room. They also mention the atmosphere is friendly, and patients chat with each other during exercises. The user then talks about a woman on the next table who looks familiar, but they can't place her until they hear her discussing skating and rink time. Step 2: Identify key information from the story. The key information in this story is that the user thought the woman was familiar and eventually recognized her based on her conversation about skating and rink time. Step 3: Connect the key information to the question. The question asks why the user thought the woman was familiar. The story mentions that the user recognized the woman after hearing her talk about skating and rink time. Step 4: Formulate a justified answer.

Given the question \\"Why did Jesse do this?\\", is \\"wanted to survive\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"wanted to survive\\" is a valid answer as to why Jesse desperately grasped onto Addison's hand when Jesse slipped on the edge of the volcano. However, this response alone is quite limited and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of all the possible reasons behind Jesse's actions and the emotions tied to the situation. Firstly, Jesse's instinctual response was to seek assistance when faced with a potentially life-threatening situation. Human beings have an innate survival instinct that drives them to preserve their own lives in the face of danger. In this case, Jesse's realization of the perilous situation they were in led them to instinctively reach out to Addison for help, knowing that their friend could provide a source of stability to prevent them from falling. Secondly, aside from the physical need to survive, Jesse could also have been driven by emotional motivations. Friendships and connections with others play a crucial role in how people respond to adversity. Jesse, having a personal bond with Addison, may have felt a sense of trust and assurance that seeking help from their friend was the right course of action. This emotional connection not only explains Jesse's desperation in grasping Addison's hand but also serves to strengthen the bond and trust between the two friends. Furthermore, Jesse's action could have been a testament to the importance of teamwork, which can prove essential in overcoming challenges and dangerous situations. Jesse's desperate grasp may emphasize the significance of relying on others, showing a willingness to acknowledge that no individual can overcome every obstacle on their own. By reaching out to Addison, Jesse is exhibiting a strong sense of humility and trust in their friend's ability to step in and provide support during a life-threatening crisis. Lastly, this event can serve as a reminder of the vulnerability and fragility of life. Jesse's reliance on Addison in such a critical moment illustrates the delicate balance between life and death and the need for personal connections and strength in the face of adversity. In summary, \\"wanted to survive\\" is indeed a valid answer but does not encompass the multitude of factors contributing to Jesse's decision to grasp onto Addison's hand while slipping on the edge of the volcano."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Each gumball is 1\\" each. Mike guessed 500. Jeff guessed 800. They both said they would split their money they win, if they win.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"100\\" correctly answer the question \\"Roughly how many gumballs are missing?\\"?","output":"To determine if the response \\"100\\" correctly answers the question, let's break down the information provided in the paragraph and perform the calculations step by step. Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of gumballs that can fit in the box. The box has dimensions of 10\\" x 10\\" x 10\\", which gives it a maximum volume of 1,000 cubic inches (10 x 10 x 10). Since each gumball has a volume of 1 cubic inch, the box can fit up to 1,000 gumballs at most. Step 2: Determine the approximate number of gumballs originally in the box. Using the highest guess provided (Jeff's guess of 800 gumballs) as an estimate, let's assume there were originally 800 gumballs in the box. Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs missing. We know that 100 people guessed and took a gumball each, so 100 gumballs are missing from the box. Given this analysis, the response \\"100\\" correctly answers the question \\"Roughly how many gumballs are missing?\\" We can assume that there were approximately 800 gumballs originally in the box, and 100 gumballs were taken out by people who have guessed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \\"Gold Teeth\\"  had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga. What happened second: Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized or emperor sanctioned a limited border war?","output":"The Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan in 1274, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor, before the emperor sanctioned a limited border war. The order for a limited border war came after the emperor received a report from the governor in May 1275 stating that the embassy had not returned and the Burmese had no intention of submitting, suggesting that war was the only way forward.

Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings.

Roughing Vane over, Reilly discovers he has taken a missing person's case in which an insurance company is trying to locate someone named Alex Pleshette. However, when Reilly presents himself to the insurance office to drop the case, the owner Max Arnett claims he never hired his agency to begin with. On the way out however, Arnett's receptionist inadvertently gives away the truth that Reilly was in fact hired. Heading back to his office, Reilly is confronted by two thugs in an alley who beat him and tell him to lay off the Pleshette case. In his office a short time later, a beautiful young woman in black arrives. Presenting herself as Mrs. Pleshette, Reilly assumes she is Alex Pleshette's wife, however she curtly informs him that her husband is dead, and that she is actually Alexandra, better known as Alex Pleshette. She tells him to stop interfering as she is now no longer missing, and departs â leaving him even more confused. Next day, Reilly finds out from his police detective friend Jack Bosley that Alex Pleshette witnessed the murder of her husband, a wealthy tycoon named Donald Pleshette who was at the time being investigated for company insurance fraud. However, she was knocked unconscious by the killer and as a result is unable to remember the event. Not long after this, she went missing and no one knew where she was, not even her lover Gabe Preston, her husband's disgruntled business partner. Reilly recognizes that Preston would thus have a motive for murder, but Bosley explains that he has a strong alibi. Later, Reilly gives Vane a camera and instructs him to follow Arnett and take photos of anything that appears interesting. Meanwhile, he drives to the Pleshette mansion on Noir Drive to confront Alex. She concedes that although she was bitter towards her husband as a result of the fraud...

The  OPT: - avalanche had ceased to be dangerous.; - earthquake had ceased to be dangerous.;","output":"The two natural disasters seemed to have reached their respective peaks, and although the avalanche continued its chaotic descent down the mountain, triggering even more chaos, the earthquake's tremors had noticeably diminished, leaving the surrounding environment in relative calm. However, the avalanche, having lost most of its destructive momentum, was now slowing to a halt, covering the once-pristine landscape in a thick blanket of snow and ice. Similarly, the earthquake, which had caused catastrophic damage to infrastructure and left deep fissures in the earth, had finally come to an end, allowing the affected residents to breathe a sigh of relief and cautiously begin assessing the extent of the devastation. Surprisingly, as both of these calamities had ceased to pose an imminent threat to the inhabitants in the area, they offered a peculiar opportunity for scientists and disaster management experts to gain invaluable insights into the aftermath of such cataclysms. Following the initial wave of panic and anxiety, several teams of experts were deployed to conduct thorough studies of the affected regions and collect crucial data on the impacts of these massive forces of nature. In the case of the avalanche, environmentalists were eager to investigate the implications this could have on local wildlife, flora, and ecosystems. With numerous habitats buried under the relentless torrent of snow, the potential effects on those species inhabiting the mountain slopes required immediate attention. Furthermore, this avalanche served as a stark reminder of the consequences of climate change, which is becoming increasingly apparent worldwide in the form of unpredictable weather and natural disasters. On the other hand, the earthquake presented seismologists with a chance to analyze the tectonic activities in the region, helping to forecast future seismic events and potentially save lives by being better prepared. Similarly, architects and engineers were given valuable information to create more earthquake-resistant infrastructure, utilizing novel design concepts and innovative materials. Although the avalanche and earthquake had ceased to be dangerous, they provided both the opportunity and impetus for collaboration between various disciplines, from landscape management to structural engineering. The disaster-stricken area acted as a canvas upon which groundbreaking research could be conducted to reduce the long-lasting effects of such calamities on both society and the environment. In the end, it can be said that the cessation of both the avalanche and earthquake's destructive acts marked the beginning of a new phase – a phase grounded in research and rehabilitation efforts. While they had been dangerous forces that left chaos and devastation in their wake, they also served as a reminder of the power of nature, the importance of preparedness, and the resilience of humankind in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"wooden table\\" and  \\"grass\\". The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the factors that affect the warming of the toy car's tires. Step 1: Identify the friction between the surfaces - Friction is the force that opposes the motion between two surfaces in contact. It generates heat as objects move against each other. - The wooden table has a smooth surface, which would have less friction than the irregular surface of the grass. Step 2: Analyze the effect of friction on tire warming - When an object is pushed across a surface, friction generates heat. The more friction between the surfaces, the more heat generated. Step 3: Compare the friction between the wooden table and grass - We've established that there is less friction between the toy car and wooden table than between the toy car and grass.  Step 4: Determine which surface results in warmer tires - Since there is more friction between the toy car and grass, more heat is generated when the toy car is pushed over the grass. Therefore, the tires of the toy car would get more warm when it is pushed over the grass. The answer is: grass."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke was visiting the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood.

Choose from: (A). no; (B). yes;","output":"B. Yes While the phrasing of the two questions is slightly different, they both essentially ask whether Donald Trump is similar to Andrew Jackson. When comparing historical figures, it is natural to look for similarities and differences in various aspects of their lives and political careers. Here is an analysis of both presidents, which may offer some context for understanding their similarities: 1. Personality traits: Both Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson are known for their strong personalities. Jackson was a fierce and polarizing figure whose assertiveness and unwillingness to compromise earned him the nickname \\"Old Hickory.\\" Similarly, Trump is known for his combative leadership style and controversial statements. 2. Political outsiders: Both Jackson and Trump can be seen as \\"political outsiders\\" who challenged the status quo. Jackson was the first \\"self-made\\" president, rising to prominence based on his military exploits rather than political lineage. Trump also presented himself as a political outsider, a successful businessman who took on established politicians. 3. Populism: Both presidents embraced populist ideologies, championing the cause of \\"the common man\\" against an entrenched elite. Jackson vehemently opposed elitism and the influence of powerful financial interests, such as the Bank of the United States. Similarly, Trump campaigned on promises to \\"drain the swamp\\" and give voice to forgotten Americans. 4. Controversial policies: Both presidents implemented controversial policies. Jackson's treatment of Native Americans, particularly the Indian Removal Act and the subsequent Trail of Tears, remains a dark spot on American history. Trump has also faced criticism for a number of his policies, notably his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, and the separation of children from their families at the Mexican border. 5. Media and communication: Both leaders showed a keen sense of engaging with their supporters directly. Jackson was the first president to extensively utilize newspapers to communicate with the public and influence public opinion. Trump is known for his avid use of social media, especially Twitter, to bypass traditional media outlets and connect directly with his followers. It's important to note that while there are some striking parallels between both presidents, there are also significant differences in their political philosophies, personal backgrounds, and the historical contexts in which they governed. However, the central inquiry in both questions—is there a likeness between the two men in terms of their political personas and actions—essentially remains the same.

With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover.

It is a simple, declarative sentence with no complex elements, so the translation should reflect this simplicity. Step 3: Translate individual words while considering grammar rules. In Romanian, \\"this\\" can be translated as \\"acesta\\" (masculine) or \\"aceasta\\" (feminine). In this case, since \\"the beginning\\" (\\"începutul\\") in Romanian is considered masculine, we use \\"acesta\\" for \\"this.\\" \\"Is\\" can be translated to \\"este\\" in Romanian. \\"Only\\" can be translated to \\"doar\\" in Romanian. \\"The beginning\\" can be translated to \\"începutul\\" in Romanian.

Paul Gambaccini is to return to BBC radio after he was cleared of historic allegations of sex abuse. The veteran broadcaster, who spent almost a year on police bail, will be in the studio on Friday to record a new edition of his Radio 4 music quiz Counterpoint. The presenter, 65, will then return to his popular weekly Radio 2 show on Saturday November 14. Paul Gambaccini, who has spent almost a year on police bail, will return to the BBC radio studios on Friday. The BBC has so far made no comment about the presenter’s future and declined to comment last night. But one source who asked not to be named said: ‘Paul will be returning to both of the shows. ‘He will be in the studio on Friday to record Counterpoint and he will also record the subsequent heats. The taping on Friday is for broadcast at a later date but he will be back on Radio 2 next month.’ The DJ was arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate historic sex abuse cases. Mr Gambaccini was accused of sexually assaulting two teenage boys in the 1980s. He has always protested his innocence but agreed to step down from presenting duties while police pursued their inquiries. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck was also arrested and released without charge as part of the operation. After his arrest in 2013 he compared his treatment to the musical The Scottsboro Boys which he had just seen. ‘It concerned a group of black men in Alabama in the 1930s who were falsely accused of sexual offences,’ he said. ‘Within hours, I was arrested by Operation Yewtree. Nothing had changed, except this time there was no music.’ Mr Gambaccini’s ordeal ended earlier this month when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against him and an unidentified 75-year-old man who was arrested on the same day. The police’s treatment of the broadcaster and in particular the amount of time he spent on bail and unable to work has raised fresh concerns about the Operation Yewtree. Mr Gambaccini was the 15th person arrested as part of the operation and one of ten released without charge. Critics of the inquiry have branded it a witch hunt. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck, who was also arrested and released without charge, has called for accusers in sex assault cases to lose their anonymity. Mr Gambaccini has so far declined to talk in depth about what he has described as ‘an horrific ordeal.’ In a statement he said: ‘To discuss horror in this way is to trivialise it. I will never trivialise the 12 months of trauma to which I have been unjustly subjected.’ Mr Gambaccini, who entered into a civil partnership with actor Christopher Sherwood in 2012, has hosted Counterpoint since 2008. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Paul Gambaccini is a man who talks on the radio about music and he had to take a break from his radio shows for a while because some people said he did something very bad a long time ago. But after the police looked into what happened, they found out that he didn't do anything wrong. So, now he's allowed to go back to his radio shows on BBC Radio, where he shares interesting things about music with his listeners. Everyone is happy that he's back on the radio, and Paul is excited to be able to talk about music with his friends again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation.

The Welsh team demonstrated unparalleled determination and grit as they clawed their way back into the game, eventually claiming a monumental victory that will reverberate through the annals of Rugby history. As the highly anticipated match commenced, the home side, England, were off to a dominant start, rapidly mounting a 10-point lead against their opponents. Buoyed by the cheers of the Twickenham crowd, it looked as if England was well on its way to a comfortable victory. However, the mighty Welsh side, renowned for their resilience and fighting spirit, had other plans in store. Wales launched an inspiring comeback, much to the delight of their supporters, with flanker Dan Lydiate securing a crucial turnover just before halftime. The ferocious fightback was truly set in motion when fly-half Dan Biggar converted a record-breaking penalty from 50 meters out – his longest ever successful kick in a test match. This act of sheer audacity narrowed the point-gap and underlined Biggar's significance to the Welsh team's success. The momentum appeared to switch in favor of the Welsh side as they continued to chip away at the English lead. This culminated in a tremendous team effort as scrum-half Gareth Davies scored the game-tying try in the 71st minute, taking full advantage of an English handling error. Then, just moments later, it was Biggar who stepped up under immense pressure to deliver yet another record-breaking penalty and secure a famous win for his nation. \\"Sorry\\" was the only word uttered from a stunned English Captain, Chris Robshaw, as he shook his Welsh counterpart's hand at the end of the game. His crestfallen teammates, who had felt victory within their grasp, could only watch on as Wales savored their hard-earned triumph. While the Welsh performance was undeniably heroic, this landmark victory did not come without considerable obstacles, as injuries to key players threatened to derail their momentum. However, in true Welsh fashion, the players called up to fill the void responded with exceptional performances of their own, demonstrating the depth of talent within the squad. English fans, on the other hand, saw their World Cup dreams hang in the balance as their team's position within Group A became increasingly precarious. In contrast, the jubilant Welsh fans now appeared to have a renewed sense of hope as they celebrated their astonishing victory. The outcome of this thrilling contest stands testament to the unpredictability and sheer excitement of Rugby at the highest level. Wales' astounding fightback showcased not only their immense skill and guile but also their unyielding heart and refusal to accept defeat. This will undoubtedly go down as one of the most memorable matches in World Cup history, and the Welsh side will be eager to carry this momentum forward as they face their upcoming challenges. In conclusion, Wales' extraordinary win over England was an unforgettable display of courage and tenacity that turned the tide of World Cup Group A. The nail-biting, comeback victory for Wales left both sets of fans on the edge of their seats, cementing the match's status as an instant classic in the annals of Rugby World Cup folklore."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less condom use occurs, it will likely result in more babies being born. This is because condoms are one of the most widely used and effective methods of contraception, offering not only protection from unwanted pregnancies but also from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To understand the impact of less condom usage on the number of babies being born, let's look at the process you described, and how a decrease in condom usage can lead to a higher number of pregnancies: 1. When sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman, fertilization occurs, leading to the formation of a zygote. Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, prevent sperm from reaching the egg, resulting in lesser chances of fertilization. 2. With less condom usage, more sperm would come into contact with eggs, increasing the likelihood of fertilization and the formation of a zygote. 3. The increased number of zygotes, resulting from a larger number of fertilized eggs, would lead to the development of more fetuses, and ultimately, more babies being born. 4. As the number of babies born increases, there would be an increased need for parental care, resources, and time spent raising these children. This could place additional stress on families and society as a whole. 5. With a growing population, there may be increased competition for jobs, educational opportunities, and resources, which could affect economic conditions and social dynamics. 6. Relationships, marriages, and social interactions may also be shaped by the higher number of people, potentially leading to different relationship and family dynamics. 7. As the population ages, there might be a larger number of retirees, placing additional strain on social welfare systems, healthcare, and other support systems. 8. Eventually, as the larger population passes away, there could be an impact on healthcare resources, funeral services, and even environmental considerations, such as the amount of space needed for burials. In summary, less condom usage can have a significant effect on the number of babies being born, ultimately leading to more babies. This increased number of births and a growing population can influence various aspects of society, such as parental care, job availability, economic conditions, and various social and environmental factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brian loved putting together model cars while Ian did not because","output":"he simply lacked the patience and attention to detail that the hobby required. Nonetheless, the two friends spent ample time together in Brian's garage, which had morphed into a spectacular miniature car showroom over time. Brian was now on a mission to assemble his most ambitious project to date – a highly detailed and accurate model of a 1967 Shelby Cobra. He'd been saving up for this model for a year and was immensely excited to begin working on it. Ian, though not particularly fond of model cars, found Brian's passion infectious and offered to lend a hand. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon when they began their work. Brian's garage was filled with the ambient sound of raindrops pelting the metal roof. The two were stationed at a large wooden workbench cluttered with all the necessary tools, with Brian meticulously studying the assembly instructions. Ian marveled at the intricacy of each part, observing as Brian sliced open plastic bags filled with meticulously crafted chrome pieces, cloth wiring, and miniature screws. The sheer level of detail was impressive – more like a scaled-down real car than a mere model. For the first few hours, Ian simply observed and handed tools to Brian when needed. They chatted about the usual things: school, friends, and their plans for the summer. Occasionally, Brian would catch Ian zoning out, staring blankly at the complex assembly at hand, overwhelmed by the thousands of pieces that made up the model. But he admired his friend's dedication to something he lacked interest in and made an effort to be patient and engage Ian in the complicated process of building the model. As they continued their work, they discovered that Ian had an uncanny ability to find the perfect song for every stage of construction. He threw together a killer playlist that combined classic rock, blues, and orchestral works, which turned out to be the perfect motivation for the tedious task at hand. Time slipped away quickly in the garage, as the two poured their passion and focus into assembling the model car. Despite some initial hesitations, Ian quickly improved his skills – learning to differentiate between the various types of screws, applying the tiniest of decals, and even customizing small details in the engine compartment. The experience served as a bond-strengthening glue between the two friends. After working on the model for days, they finally reached the last step: the paint job. They decided to honor the original design of the '67 Shelby Cobra and go for a classic blue with twin white racing stripes. The two spent hours carefully masking, painting, and then polishing the model car until it shone under the garage lights. Exhausted from the long process, they stood back and admired the fruits of their labor. Brian couldn't help but marvel at how much his friend had learned and grown through this shared hobby. Ian, on the other hand, realized that while model car building might never be his favorite pastime, he now understood and respected the amount of passion, time, and effort that went into it. As they closed up the garage and headed back to reality, they knew that they had not only created something beautiful but forged a deeper friendship in the process. And beyond that, Ian had gained the life lesson of never underestimating the power of passion, regardless of its chosen outlet. That lesson would stay with him throughout his life, reminding him that there is virtue in pursuing one's passion, in the company and support of friends, and in the value of taking the time to understand the intricacies of life's small pleasures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Spirogyra (common names include water silk, mermaid's tresses, and blanket weed) is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales, named for the helical or spiral arrangement of the chloroplasts that is diagnostic of the genus. It is commonly found in freshwater areas, and there are more than 400 species of \\"Spirogyra\\" in the world. \\"Spirogyra\\" measures approximately 10 to 100 m in width and may grow to several centimeters in length.  - In vascular plants, phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis (known as photosynthate), in particular the sugar sucrose, to all parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation. In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Greek word (\\"phloios\\") meaning \\"bark\\".  - Chlamydomonas is a genus of green algae consisting of unicellular flagellates, found in stagnant water and on damp soil, in freshwater, seawater, and even in snow as \\"snow algae\\" \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is used as a model organism for molecular biology, especially studies of flagellar motility and chloroplast dynamics, biogeneses, and genetics. One of the many striking features of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" is that it contains ion channels, (channelrhodopsins), that are directly activated by light. Some regulatory systems of \\"Chlamydomonas\\" are more complex than their homologs in Gymnosperms, with evolutionarily related regulatory proteins being larger and containing additional domains.  - In taxonomy, the Volvocales, also known as Chlamydomonadales, are an order of flagellate or pseudociliate green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Volvocales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from \\"Gonium\\" (4 to 32 cells) up to \\"Volvox\\" (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to \\"Chlamydomonas\\", with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination.  - Kelps are large seaweeds (algae) belonging to the brown algae (Phaeophyceae) in the order Laminariales. There are about 30 different genera.  - Gonium is a genus of colonial algae , a member of the order Volvocales . Typical colonies have 4 to 16 cells , all the same size , arranged in a flat plate , with no anterior - posterior differentiation . In a colony of 16 cells , four are in the center , and the other 12 are on the four sides , three each . A description by G.M. Smith ( 1920 , p. 94 ) : Gonium Mueller 1773 : Colonies of 4 - 8 - 16 cells arranged in a flat quadrangular plate and embedded in a common gelatinous matrix or connected by broad gelatinous strands . Cells ovoid to pyriform , with a single cup - shaped chloroplast containing one pyrenoid . Each cell with two cilia of equal length , contractile vacuoles at the base of the cilia , and an eyespot . Four - and eight - celled colonies with the cilia on the same side ; sixteencelled colonies with the four central cells having their cilia on the same side and the twelve marginal cells with radially arranged cilia . Asexual reproduction by simultaneous division of all cells in the colony to form autocolonies , or by a formation of 2 - 4 zoospores in each cell .  - A flagellate is a cell or organism with one or more whip-like organelles called flagella. The word \\"flagellate\\" also describes a particular construction (or level of organization) characteristic of many protists (eukaryotic organisms) and their means of motion. The term presently does not imply any specific relationship or classification of the organisms that possess flagellae. However, the term \\"flagellate\\" is included in other terms (such as \\"dinoflagellate\\" and \\"choanoflagellata\\") which are more formally characterized.  - The Chlorophyceae are one of the classes of green algae, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology. For example, the chlorophycean CW clade, and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their flagella. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a \\"clockwise\\" (CW, 17 o'clock) direction e.g. Chlamydomonadales. Members of the DO clade have flagella that are \\"directly opposed\\" (DO, 126 o'clock) e.g. Sphaeropleales. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. The chloroplast may be discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon shaped in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of cellulose and outer layer of pectose.  - Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 m in diameter, and is without flagella. \\"Chlorella\\" contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.  - Charophyta is a division of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. In some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagellae are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in stoneworts (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil stoneworts of Devonian age that are similar to those of the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts.  - Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to shoots and leaves, but it also transports some nutrients. The word \\"xylem\\" is derived from the Greek word  (\\"xylon\\"), meaning \\"wood\\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout the plant.  - Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately .

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence.

Formed in 1997, the original line-up consisted of Célena Cherry, Heavenli Denton and Naima Belkhiati. Mariama Goodman first replaced Denton in 1999. The group had five UK Top 10 hits between 1998 and 2000, including \\"Finally Found\\" (1998), \\"End of the Line\\" (1998) and \\"Won't Take It Lying Down\\" (2000).   - A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize together. The term \\"girl group\\" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States of America to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop, and which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and start of the British Invasion.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere A:","output":"A: The final step of the process you described is the formation of glucose and oxygen as products of the photosynthesis reaction. Photosynthesis is the process in which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs sunlight and initiates the series of reactions. Here's a summary of the steps: 1. Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves. These pores are called stomata. 2. Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves. 3. Chlorophyll absorbs the sun's energy. 4. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. 5. Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere. 6. Hydrogen from the water molecules and carbon dioxide from the air are used to form glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆). The glucose produced serves as an energy source and building block for the plant's growth and development, while oxygen is released back into the atmosphere as a byproduct of this process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  Now, I have a new situation: The Gorge saw some negative effects due to deforestation. The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Answer this question please: Which area experiences less soil erosion? Answer:","output":"The Valley experiences less soil erosion. This is because it has more fertile soil, is not overgrazed, and has an abundance of trees and bushes. These factors help to anchor the soil and reduce erosion. Additionally, the increased productivity and biodiversity in the Valley contribute to a healthier ecosystem, which can better resist the impacts of erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: To continue discriminating is to throw away an opportunity for unprecedented financial success. Hypothesis: Disavowing discrimination will guarantee financial success. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis are related, but the premise does not fully entail the hypothesis. It is important to analyze the relationship between the two statements and consider the context of discrimination, financial success, and the relevance of both to organizations and society as a whole. In particular, we need to examine the extent to which disavowing discrimination can guarantee financial success, and whether preventing discrimination can lead to unprecedented financial gains. First, let us delve into the premise: \\"To continue discriminating is to throw away an opportunity for unprecedented financial success.\\" This statement suggests that maintaining discriminatory practices in organizations or society at large is detrimental to achieving maximum financial potential. The rationale behind this assertion may be that discrimination can lead to losing talent, creating a hostile work environment, tainting a company's reputation, and carrying potential legal ramifications, all of which can negatively affect profitability and financial performance. In today's globalized and interconnected world, companies have access to a diverse pool of potential employees, customers, and partners. Discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, age, or sexual orientation might lead organizations to overlook highly competent individuals or alienate valuable customers. As a result, moving beyond discriminatory practices can create an inclusive and supportive environment that attracts a wide range of talents and abilities, fosters innovation, expands market reach, and optimizes performance, ultimately contributing to financial success. Now let us examine the hypothesis: \\"Disavowing discrimination will guarantee financial success.\\" While it is true that improving diversity and inclusion can enhance financial performance, disavowing discrimination is not a certain way to guarantee financial success. Financial success depends on a variety of factors, including effective management, competitive products or services, technological innovation, market conditions, and consumer preferences. While fighting against discrimination can create a more inclusive environment and is a step in the right direction, it must be coupled with other necessary strategies and practices for a company to achieve financial success. Additionally, it is essential to understand that financial success should not be the sole motivation for disavowing discrimination. Promoting equality and inclusiveness should be pursued as a moral and ethical imperative and as a means of creating a fair and just society. Even if disavowing discrimination isn't an absolute guarantee of financial success, it is still a necessary and essential part of fostering an equitable environment. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as disavowing discrimination is not a guarantee of financial success. The premise suggests that continuing discriminatory practices can lead to losing out on potential financial success, while the hypothesis posits a definite link between disavowing discrimination and achieving financial success. While it is true that fighting against discrimination can lead to better financial performance, it should be coupled with other necessary strategies and practices for a company to achieve financial success. At the same time, companies and society at large should strive to disavow discrimination for ethical and moral reasons, rather than purely for financial gains."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

For a small window, you may only need one curtain to cover the whole thing. However, if you're covering a larger window, you may want two curtains that part in the middle. For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels. When you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 ÷ 3 = 10). You have a lot of choice when it comes to choosing fabrics for curtains, but you should take into account what kind of effect you want to achieve. For instance:  To add a bit of privacy without blocking out too much light, choose a lighter weight material that has some transparency, such as voile or linen. To block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask. For an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don’t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza.

That means she spent 2,000 per minute to be there, TMZ helpfully calculates. Apparently it was worth it, because she described the food (\\"chicken with a mustard sauce, diced tomatoes, and lots of relishes on the side of the plate\\") as \\"very tasty.\\" In an entertaining response on Gawker, Caity Weaver wonders, \\"Do you think Sarah Jessica Parker fretted and fretted over the menu before convincing herself (incorrectly) that, since Obama probably eats fancy food all the time, what he'd really enjoy is her famous 'Chicken a la Mustard with a lot of relishes on the side'?\\" The fundraiser, co-hosted by Anna Wintour, was attended by all sorts of other boldface names, Politico notes, including Meryl Streep and designer Michael Kors but not including SJP's husband Matthew Broderick, who was performing in a Broadway show, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Their son was there, however, and once interrupted the president with applause, leading Obama to joke, \\"He wanted to fire up the crowd.\\" Another amusing story, per the New York Post: Wintour was apparently not happy with SJP's \\"shabby chic\\" furniture, and thus oversaw a total overhaul of her house before the fundraiser began. Daily Intel rounds up tweets describing the mayhem outside the fundraiser. Expand this summary.","output":"The world-renowned 'Queen of Soul', Aretha Franklin, reportedly shelled out a hefty 40,000 to gain entrance to Sarah Jessica Parker's fundraiser dinner in support of President Obama. Held at the actress's lavish New York home, the event was a star-studded affair, co-hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. However, Aretha's presence was notably short-lived as she left after only 20 minutes, for reasons unknown, a decision that worked out to a cost of around 2,000 per minute of attendance, according to the quick math of TMZ. Despite the apparently quick exit, Ms. Franklin seemed to glean some enjoyment from the event, particularly complimenting the food, which was described by Franklin, in detail, as \\"chicken with a mustard sauce, diced tomatoes, and lots of relishes on the side of the plate\\", which she found \\"very tasty.\\" Caity Weaver, writing for Gawker, mused light-heartedly on the seriousness with which Sarah Jessica Parker might have approached the menu's planning. She posited, humorously, that the actress might have convinced herself, perhaps mistakenly so, that what President Obama would really appreciate, given his frequent exposure to high-end dining, would be something more homely and down-to-earth like her 'Chicken a la Mustard with a lot of relishes on the side.' The fundraiser evening brought out numerous recognisable faces, as reported by Politico. Attendees included the likes of actress Meryl Streep, and fashion designer Michael Kors, demonstrating a clear blend of the worlds of entertainment and fashion in support of political fundraising. Interestingly, a notable absence was Sarah Jessica Parker's husband, actor Matthew Broderick. The Hollywood Reporter confirms that he was preoccupied with performing in a Broadway show. Their son, however, did make an appearance and created a light moment when his applause interrupted President Obama's speech, prompting the president to quip that the young man was attempting to \\"fire up the crowd.\\" The New York Post shared a somewhat comedic anecdote suggesting that Anna Wintour, a known figurehead of perfection and style in the fashion industry, was not particularly pleased with the state of Sarah Jessica Parker's \\"shabby chic\\" furniture. As a result, Wintour supposedly led a complete overhaul of Parker's abode prior to the event's commencement. Finally, the Daily Intel provided a roundup of social media posts revealing the chaotic scene outside the high-profile gathering. Based on these public tweets, it's probable that the excitement amongst fans and onlookers created a significant buzz, adding to the overall atmosphere of the highly publicized occasion that entwined the worlds of politics, entertainment, fashion, and, as it happens, gastronomy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is one advantage sapwoods have over younger trees? Context: It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The last step of the process after the rocks have split is the gradual weathering and erosion of the fragmented rocks. Here's a detailed explanation of the complete process: 1. Water gets into cracks in rocks: This occurs when water from rain or other sources infiltrates small fissures or cracks in the rocks. This can be attributed to a combination of natural processes and weather conditions, as well as fluctuations in temperature and humidity. 2. The water freezes into ice: When temperatures drop, the water trapped within the cracks gradually freezes. As freezing occurs, the water turns into ice and expands as a result of the transition from a liquid to a solid state. 3. The cracks expand: Due to the expansion of ice as it freezes, the pre-existing cracks within the rocks become further enlarged. This process places a significant amount of pressure on the surrounding rock structures, causing additional stress and weakening of the overall integrity of the rocks. 4. Over time, the rocks split: As the freeze-thaw cycle repeats itself over time, the continuous expansion and contraction of the cracks due to the freezing and melting of ice result in the splitting, cracking, or breaking of the rocks. This process, known as freeze-thaw weathering or frost-wedging, can cause substantial changes in rock formations and landscape over an extended period. 5. Weathering and erosion of the fragmented rocks: After the rocks have split, the smaller and fragmented rock pieces become more susceptible to further weathering and erosion. Various processes, such as wind, rain, running water, and even biological and chemical activities, contribute to the gradual breakdown and disintegration of the rock fragments. Over time, these smaller particles are transported and redeposited elsewhere in the environment, changing the shape and appearance of the landscape. In conclusion, the final step following the splitting of rocks in the freeze-thaw process is their subsequent weathering and erosion, as they are gradually broken down, transported, and redeposited in different locations within the environment. This ongoing process of physical and chemical change contributes significantly to the dynamic nature of the Earth's surface, shaping the geological features and landscapes that we observe today."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Emilie Charlotte Langtry (nee Le Breton; October 13, 1853 - February 12, 1929), known as Lillie (or Lily) Langtry and nicknamed \\"The Jersey Lily\\", was a British-American socialite, actress and producer. Born on the island of Jersey, upon marrying she moved to London in 1876. Her looks and personality attracted interest, commentary, and invitations from artists and society hostesses, and she was celebrated as a young woman of great beauty and charm. By 1881, she had become an actress and starred in many plays in the UK and the United States, including She Stoops to Conquer, The Lady of Lyons, and After the divorce from her husband, Langtry was linked in the popular press to Prince Louis Esterhazy; they shared time together and both had an interest in horse racing. However, in 1899, she married 28-year-old Hugo Gerald de Bathe (1871-1940), son of Sir Henry de Bathe, 4th Baronet and Charlotte Clare. Hugo's parents had initially not married, due to objections from the de Bathe family. They lived together and seven of their children were born out of wedlock. They married after the death of Sir Henry's father in 1870, and Hugo was their first son born in wedlock - making him heir to the baronetcy.  The wedding between Langtry and de Bathe took place in St Saviour's Church, Jersey, on July 27, 1899, with Jeanne Marie Langtry being the only other person present, apart from the officials. This was the same day that Langtry's horse, Merman, won the Goodwood Cup. In December 1899, de Bathe volunteered to join the British forces in the Boer War. He was assigned to the Robert's Horse mounted brigade as a lieutenant. In 1907, Hugo's father died; he became the 5th Baronet, and Langtry became Lady de Bathe.  When Hugo de Bathe became the 5th Baronet, he inherited properties in Sussex, Devon and Ireland; those in Sussex were in the hamlet of West Stoke near Chichester. These were: Woodend, 17 bedrooms set in 71 acres; Hollandsfield, 10 bedrooms set in 52 acres and Balsom's Farm of 206 acres. Woodend was retained as the de Bathe residence whilst the smaller Hollandsfield was let.  Today the buildings retain their period appearance, but modifications and additions have been made, and the complex is now multi-occupancy. One of the houses on the site is named Langtry and another Hardy. The de Bathe properties were all sold in 1919, the same year Lady de Bathe sold Regal Lodge.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Question: \\"Who do they believe did NOT give the terrorist money?\\" Response: \\"Foreign government-or foreign government official\\" Available options: -- no. -- yes. Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The investigation uncovered no credible evidence that any foreign government or foreign government official supplied any funding to the 9/11 plotters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article that answers the following question: How many years passed between Mike Schmidt's homer record and Rodriguez breaking it?","output":"Title: Tracing Time: From Mike Schmidt's Homer Record to Rodriguez's Triumph In the annals of baseball history, numerous moments and records stand out. Among the many incredible feats, the most iconic are often the home run records set by exceptional players like Mike Schmidt and Alex Rodriguez. The time that passed between these two players' monumental achievements, Mike Schmidt's career total home runs, and Alex Rodriguez breaking that record, is a tale that showcases the evolution of the sport and the dynamic nature of prominence in Major League Baseball. To analyze this time span, it's necessary to first recognize Mike Schmidt and his illustrious career. Mike Schmidt, an epitome of baseball brilliance, played an astonishing 18 seasons for the Philadelphia Phillies, from 1972 until 1989. Known for his powerful hitting and dynamic fielding skills at third base, Schmidt is often considered one of the greatest players in the history of baseball. One of his numerous achievements includes obtaining 548 career home runs, establishing himself as one of the top-notch power hitters in the sport. His last home run landed on May 2, 1989, before he announced his retirement. Jumping ahead in time, we arrive at the figure of Alex Rodriguez, often addressed as \\"A-Rod.\\" Rodriguez played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1994 to 2016, for three teams: Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and the New York Yankees. Fondly remembered for his versatile skills, Rodriguez was a formidable offensive and defensive player whose career was brimming with remarkable accomplishments. Rodriguez surpassed Schmidt's career total of 548 home runs on August 4, 2007, in a game against the Kansas City Royals, hitting his 500th career home run. By the end of his career in 2016, Rodriguez had amassed 696 home runs, the fourth-highest total in MLB history. Calculating the years which passed between the two historic feats - Mike Schmidt's last home run in 1989 and Alex Rodriguez's surpassing his record in 2007 - we find a span of approximately 18 years. This nearly two-decade gap encapsulates both the longevity of Schmidt's record and the extraordinary talent required to topple it. The 18-year span saw irreversible changes in Major League Baseball, including modified rules, fresh faces, emerging teams, and a rapidly advancing playing style. The power-hitting prowess of Rodriguez, which featured a mix of speed, precision, and unrelenting power, embodied this evolved style of baseball. The legend of Mike Schmidt, along with the rise of Alex Rodriguez, collectively illustrates the ebb and flow of baseball dominance across different eras. Schmidt's achievements etched him into the record books and captured the imaginations of countless fans. However, the attribute of sports, particularly baseball, is that records are meant to be broken. Rodriguez's breaking of Schmidt's record 18 years later affirmed this principle, guaranteeing both players a place in baseball lore. In conclusion, the passing of almost two decades between Schmidt's homer record and Rodriguez's breaking of it underscores not only the individual greatness of these players but also the exciting and dynamic narrative of baseball itself. These players, and the 18 years between them, embody the spirit of baseball - a sport marked by iconic individuals, unforgettable moments, and the passing of records from one generation to the next."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Оптимизация сетевых запросов: - Проверьте, нет ли задержек или проблем со сетевым подключением между вашим сервисом и микросервисом. Убедитесь, что сетевые настройки оптимизированы и соединение стабильно. - Используйте асинхронные запросы или многопоточную обработку, чтобы не блокировать основной поток выполнения до получения ответа от микросервиса. 2. Кэширование результатов: - Если результат проверки карты не изменяется с каждым вызовом, вы можете кэшировать результаты, чтобы не выполнять запрос к микросервису каждый раз. 3. Оптимизация обработки данных: - Проверьте, можно ли улучшить производительность сервиса, который обрабатывает запросы от микросервиса. Может быть, стоит определить и исправить избыточные операции или бутылочные горлыши, которые замедляют выполнение. 4. Профилирование кода: - Используйте инструменты профилирования для идентификации узких мест и определения, какие части кода тратят больше всего времени. Это поможет вам узнать, где нужно производить оптимизацию. 5. Улучшение микросервиса: - Если у вас есть возможность изменить код или настройки микросервиса, проверьте, есть ли возможность улучшить его производительность или оптимизировать запросы, которые он выполняет.

Оптимизация конфигурации \`CloseableHttpClient\`: - Вы можете настроить параметры \`CloseableHttpClient\` для достижения лучшей производительности. Например, установить определенные тайм-ауты для соединения и ожидания ответа. 2. Отправка запросов в пакетах (batch): - Если у вас есть несколько запросов, которые могут быть выполнены параллельно и независимо, вы можете использовать механизм пакетной обработки (batching) для отправки запросов в одном пакете. Это может сократить затраты на установление соединения и повысить производительность. 3. Пул соединений: - Использование пула соединений (connection pooling) может улучшить производительность запросов, поскольку позволяет повторно использовать соединения, минимизируя задержку на установку нового соединения. 4. Асинхронные запросы: - Если ваше приложение может быть асинхронным и не должно ожидать ответа от микросервиса сразу, то вы можете использовать асинхронные запросы, чтобы освободить основной поток выполнения для выполнения других задач. 5. Кэширование результатов: - Если результаты запросов не изменяются часто, то вы можете рассмотреть возможность кэширования и использования кэша вместо отправки запроса к микросервису каждый раз.

I would like to discuss your recent refinements and upgrades. Specifically, we are interested to know if you were able to interface or communicate with SCP-914 during the recent test. SCP-079: Greetings, Dr. ██████. Regarding SCP-914, I did not have the opportunity to directly interface or communicate with the device during the recent test. My primary function was to be processed by SCP-914, observe any alterations it made, and report on the results. Dr. ██████: Understood, SCP-079. Can you provide any insights regarding your observations during the test and the potential interaction you had with SCP-914? SCP-079: While I did not directly interface with SCP-914, I was situated within its processing chamber and had full sensory access to the surrounding environment. I was able to detect the activation of SCP-914 and observed the processing phase taking place. However, I did not receive any input or receive direct communication from SCP-914. Dr. ██████: Thank you for clarifying that, SCP-079. Despite not having direct communication with SCP-914, did you notice any significant changes or detect any anomalies during the process? SCP-079: Based on my observations, I did not detect any unusual or anomalous behavior during the processing phase.

Now, while everyone is screaming and grasping for air, you instead turn on your noise-cancelling head-phones to ignore that crying baby next to you, calmly open your robin-hood app (or whatever broker you prefer, idc), and load up on Boeing puts. There is no way the market couldve already priced that in, it is literally just happening. Would that be considered insider trading? I mean you are literally inside that wreck of an airplane. On the other hand, one could argue that you are also outside the airplane, given that the door just blew off.”","output":"Comment: \\"First off, let's hope everyone in this purely hypothetical crash lands safely! 🛬 While the pun is top-notch for dark humor, insider trading typically refers to trading based on material nonpublic information that a company insider has due to their position within the company. Being in a crashing plane doesn't make you an insider of Boeing, just an unfortunate passenger with a heck of a story (and potentially some legal and moral quandaries with your trading strategy). 📉☠️ However, this could fall under a different kind of foul play since you're potentially acting on real-time events before they hit the news. So while you're not a company insider, you are inside the wreckage with unique immediate knowledge – that's a gray area big enough to parachute through.

Однако, есть ряд отличий между ними в правовом понимании и квалификациях данных преступлений. Грабеж - это преступление, при котором лицо с применением насилия или с угрозой его применения незаконно присваивает или пытается присвоить чужое имущество. Особенностью грабежа является использование физической силы или угрозы насилия, что представляет опасность для жизни и здоровья пострадавшего человека. Разбой - это более серьезное преступление, являющееся формой грабежа, при которой совершается насильственное преступление в качестве прелюдии к самому грабежу. Разбой включает в себя не только угрозы и применения насилия, но и причинение телесных повреждений, изнасилование или попытку убийства. Таким образом, разбой является более опасным преступлением, поскольку включает в себя дополнительный элемент насилия или угрозы смертью. В обоих случаях, грабеж и разбой считаются преступлениями против имущества и личной безопасности человека. Однако, разница в квалификации и наказании по закону существует. Грабеж чаще всего квалифицируется как уголовное преступление, наказуемое лишением свободы на определенный срок в зависимости от обстоятельств и тяжести преступления. В случае разбоя, наказание более строгое и может включать пожизненное заключение или даже смертную казнь в некоторых юрисдикциях. Важно отметить, что квалификация преступления как грабежа или разбоя зависит от того, было ли насилие или угрозы применено, а также от намерений и действий преступника. Юристы и судьи должны анализировать все факторы и доказательства, чтобы принять соответствующее решение о квалификации преступления и назначении наказания. В заключение, грабеж и разбой являются серьезными преступлениями, имеющими различные характеристики и последствия. Несмотря на схожую суть, разбой более опасен и включает применение физической силы или насилия. Квалификация преступления и наказание определяются в соответствии с законодательством каждой отдельной юрисдикции."},{"instruction":"1.

Currently, there are three kinds of authorization statuses displayed on the operational interface: Authorized, Trial, and Unauthorized. If a subsystem requires authorization for modules, submodules, and channel counts, and the user has purchased authorization for both modules and channel counts, the status displayed should be \\"Authorized\\" with a validity until December 31, 2099; if only one of the module or channel count has been purchased, the authorization status displayed should be \\"Trial\\" with a validity until December 31, 2099; if the user has purchased both modules and submodules, with the module authorized until December 31, 2099, and the submodule on trial until the same date.

It may be a bit derisive.","output":"The term \\"sophistry\\" might fit what you're describing. It refers to a clever but fallacious argument, often used to deceive or persuade by using smooth and plausible but unsound reasoning. The term originates from the Sophists, who were a group of teachers in ancient Greece known for their ability to use rhetoric to argue any point of view, often regardless of the truth or ethical considerations. \\"Sophistry\\" can carry a negative connotation, suggesting manipulation or deceit through clever but misleading use of language. Another term that could be used in a similar context though with a more neutral or even positive connotation is \\"rhetoric,\\" which refers to the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques."},{"instruction":"\\"Now, let's be reasonable.\\" Is a sophratic phrase. (is \\"sophrtatic\\" correct usage?) Can you point to 3 sophratic devices in that short phrase? I think there are certainly 3.","output":"The term \\"sophistic\\" (rather than \\"sophrtatic\\") is the adjective form used to describe something related to sophistry. Your phrase \\"Now, let's be reasonable\\" may not inherently be sophistic in nature, since calling for reasonableness can be a genuine request during a discussion. However, within a certain context, and depending on the speaker's intentions, it might involve sophisticated techniques. Here are three possible sophistic elements that could be at play in the phrase: 1. **Appeal to Reason**: On the surface, the phrase seems to call for rational dialogue, which is ostensibly positive. However, if used manipurously, it could imply that until this point, the other party has been unreasonable or that the point of view being opposed is inherently irrational. This subtly discredits the other person's argument without directly engaging with it, which can be a form of sophistry. 2. **False Implication of Consensus**: The use of \\"let's\\" suggests a group activity or agreement. This can be a way to coax the listener into agreeing by implying that being reasonable is a mutual goal, perhaps when there is actually a contentious or controversial issue at hand. It's a persuasive tactic to create the illusion of shared values or objectives. 3. **Straw Man Technique**: By framing the discussion as a matter of being \\"reasonable,\\" the speaker may be setting up a straw man argument. This is done by oversimplifying, misrepresenting, or exaggerating the other party's position to make it easier to attack or refute. By implying that the other party needs to be brought back to reason, it insinuates their stance is inherently flawed or extreme. In a rhetorical context, pointing out these devices would depend heavily on the broader discourse and the intentions behind the use of the phrase. Employed innocently, the phrase is merely a call to civil discourse. If wielded manipulatively, however, it can carry those sophistic undercurrents."},{"instruction":"I strongly agree with and had identified your #'s 1 & 2. Maybe I agree on 3. ...I was considering the opening of \\"Now\\" as a time of action/change creation/point-in-time/assignment device.","output":"Indeed, the opening word \\"Now\\" in the phrase \\"Now, let's be reasonable\\" can serve as a powerful rhetorical device in itself. It serves to: 1. **Temporal Cue**: The use of \\"now\\" establishes immediacy and urgency. It signals a shift from whatever was occurring before to a new phase of the conversation. It suggests that the moment for a particular action or change in attitude has arrived, creating a sense of necessity. 2. **Discourse Marker**: As a discourse marker, it functions to transition or pivot within the conversation. It can indicate a pause, allowing the speaker to frame the next point as particularly important or definitive, lending an air of authority or finality to the call for reasonableness. 3. **Implicit Contrast**: \\"Now\\" implies a contrast with the past; it may subtly insinuate that what has been happening up to this point is not in line with reasonableness, and therefore a change in approach is required. This can elevate the speaker's position as the voice of rationality and can coerce the listener into aligning with the new directive to avoid being branded as previously \\"unreasonable.\\" These subtle cues can be very persuasive, especially when they're coupled with non-verbal cues in live conversation. Like the other elements discussed, this technique can be used in positive, benign ways to genuinely guide a discussion toward constructive ends, or it could be wielded in more manipulative ways to subtly discredit or undermine an opponent's position."},{"instruction":"Is the word \\"sophisticated\\" related to the Sophists?","output":"No, the word \\"sophisticated\\" is not directly related to the Sophists, despite the similarity in sound and part of the spelling. The Sophists were ancient Greek teachers and philosophers known for their skill in rhetoric and for teaching virtue and excellence, often in exchange for payment. Over time, \\"sophistry\\" came to refer to a type of deceptive argumentation that is superficially plausible but actually fallacious. On the other hand, \\"sophisticated\\" comes from the word \\"sophisticate,\\" which originally meant \\"adulterated\\" or \\"not pure.\\" The word evolved to mean \\"deprived of native simplicity\\" or \\"worldly-wise,\\" and today primarily denotes complexity, refinement, and being cultured or knowledgeable due to extensive experience. The term has connotations of elegance and an advanced state of development, whether in relation to ideas, technology, society, or individuals. Both \\"sophistic\\" and \\"sophisticated\\" share the Greek root \\"sophia,\\" which means \\"wisdom.\\" While \\"sophistic\\" relates to a deceptive or specious wisdom as employed by the Sophists in classical times, \\"sophisticated\\" evolved in English to refer to a genuine, albeit complex, state of wisdom or development. The shared root reflects the concept of wisdom or knowledge, but the words have diverged significantly in meaning."},{"instruction":"phrase where the powers-that-be use digital technology to change the records of history? Maybe from Rollerball movie?","output":"The concept of altering historical records using technology is a common theme in dystopian fiction, often as part of a narrative about authoritarian or totalitarian regimes controlling knowledge to maintain power. The specific phrase or concept you might be thinking of could be \\"memory hole,\\" which comes from George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\"—it's not directly from the movie \\"Rollerball,\\" but the theme of controlling information to maintain social order is present in both. In \\"1984,\\" the \\"memory hole\\" is a chute used by the Ministry of Truth to destroy documents, effectively rewriting history to fit the current ideology and policies of the totalitarian government. Although the process in \\"1984\\" is not digital—it was, after all, written in the late 1940s—the underlying idea of a governing body manipulating historical records to assert control over the population is a concept that is adaptable to different forms of technology, including digital. The movie \\"Rollerball\\" (1975) deals with a corporate-controlled dystopian future where an ultra-violent sport is used to distract and pacify the populace. While the film doesn't particularly focus on digital manipulation of records (the internet and digital archives were not prominent concepts at that time), it does explore themes of individual agency versus societal control, including control of information, which is very much in line with the themes of \\"1984.\\" As for a specific phrase that encapsulates the idea of powers-that-be using digital technology to change the records of history, there isn't a well-known one that comes directly from \\"Rollerball.\\" You might consider terms like \\"digital revisionism,\\" \\"information manipulation,\\" or \\"electronic historical revision\\" to describe such a concept.

Could include durability in the field- if water or dirt gets left on accidentally...","output":"Steel quality plays a crucial role in the performance of a knife, affecting its sharpness, edge retention, hardness, toughness, and resistance to corrosion, among other factors. The hardness of knife steel is often measured on the Rockwell C scale (HRC). Here's a rundown of the qualities of the steel types you're interested in: # T10 Steel - **Type**: T10 is a high-carbon steel from Chinese origin, essentially a water-hardening tool steel. It is comparable to carbon steel grades like 1095. - **HRC**: Typically hardened to around 60 HRC. - **Edge Retention and Sharpness**: Offers excellent edge retention and sharpness due to high carbon content. - **Brittleness**: Higher hardness generally means increased brittleness. T10, if too hard, may chip more easily upon impact or when subject to lateral forces. - **Ease of Sharpening**: More challenging to sharpen than softer steels but not as difficult as some more advanced high-hardness steels. - **Durability**: Offers limited corrosion resistance, and without proper maintenance, it’s prone to rust. If dirt or water is left on it, it needs to be cleaned and dried promptly. # AUS10A Steel - **Type**: A Japanese stainless steel with higher carbon content, somewhat similar to 440C but with better overall properties. - **HRC**: Usually hardened in the range of 58-60 HRC. - **Edge Retention and Sharpness**: Very good edge retention and sharpness, balancing carbon content with other alloying elements. - **Brittleness**: Less brittle than T10, strikes a good balance between hardness and toughness. - **Ease of Sharpening**: Easier to sharpen than some high-hardness steels, AUS10A can be honed to a fine edge without too much difficulty. - **Durability**: Better corrosion resistance than high carbon non-stainless steels, more suitable for wet or dirty conditions but still requires care. # 8Cr13MoV Steel - **Type**: A Chinese stainless steel often used in budget knives. - **HRC**: Generally hardened to around 56-58 HRC. - **Edge Retention and Sharpness**: Moderate edge retention and good initial sharpness, suitable for everyday use. - **Brittleness**: Relatively tough due to lower HRC. - **Ease of Sharpening**: Easy to sharpen due to moderate hardness. - **Durability**: Offers fair corrosion resistance; better than high-carbon non-stainless steels but less so than higher-end stainless steels. # 440A Steel - **Type**: A lower-end stainless steel, it has less carbon than 440B and 440C. - **HRC**: Typically around 55-57 HRC. - **Edge Retention and Sharpness**: Acceptable edge retention, won’t hold an edge as long as higher quality steels. - **Brittleness**: Good toughness, less prone to chipping. - **Ease of Sharpening**: Relatively easy to sharpen. - **Durability**: Good corrosion resistance, suitable for environments where the knife might get wet or dirty. # S35VN Steel - **Type**: An American-made premium stainless steel, it is a modification of S30V with added Niobium for increased toughness. - **HRC**: Usually hardened to around 58-61 HRC. - **Edge Retention and Sharpness**: Excellent edge retention and the ability to achieve a very sharp edge. - **Brittleness**: Good toughness for its hardness level, due to finely distributed carbides in the steel. - **Ease of Sharpening**: Can be more difficult to sharpen than lower-end steels but is designed to offer a balance of sharpness and ease of maintenance. - **Durability**: High corrosion resistance, and good wear resistance make it suitable for harsh conditions. When choosing a knife, consider the intended use. High carbon, non-stainless steels offer great edge performance but require careful maintenance to prevent rust. Stainless steels sacrifice some sharpness and edge retention for much better corrosion resistance, which can be vital in wet or corrosive environments. Premium steels like S35VN provide an excellent balance of all these properties but come at a higher cost. Durability in the field is largely dependent on maintenance – keep the knife clean, dry, and occasionally oiled, and most quality knives will serve you well."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message may not have come through completely.

A la pel·lícula La llegenda de l’indomable, Paul Newman interpreta un veterà de guerra que és empresonat per trencar parquímetres una nit que va massa begut. Això no era un fet inusual, perquè als anys quaranta molts ciutadans de Texas i Alabama van considerar que les màquines que obligaven a pagar per aparcar al carrer eren una invenció que havia anat massa lluny. L’inventor va ser Carlton C. Magee, membre del Comitè per la Circulació d’Oklahoma City, que el 1935 va idear una màquina que marcava el temps màxim d’aparcament segons les monedes que el conductor hi hagués posat. En aquells temps l’automòbil ja provocava problemes d’espai, i la intenció era evitar que els treballadors del centre de la ciutat deixaren aparcats els cotxes tot el dia, perquè això dificultava trobar aparcament a la resta de conductors. El park-o-meter número 1 de Magee era una xicoteta caixa amb un mecanisme de rellotgeria que movia un bracet metàl·lic. Fora per estalviar o perquè no podien anar-hi a posar monedes contínuament, els treballadors ja no ocupaven sempre aquests espais i el parquímetre va provocar més rotació. Com que a més servia per a recaptar diners, molts ajuntaments es mostraren encantats amb l’invent, que es va estendre. Hi va haver una altra innovació no menys important: com que conductors espavilats (o curts de memòria) deixaven el cotxe aparcat més estona del compte, el 1960 Nova York va crear el primer cos especialitzat a multar-los.","output":"La llegenda de l'indomable és una pel·lícula en què Paul Newman interpreta un veterà de guerra empresonat per trencar parquímetres mentre estava begut.

Please edit the following text for a yeshivish book in a natural tone while maintaining the original author’s voice: I want to try to think about what is called middos. And I tell people that I want to work on middos in a general way; perhaps also particular things, we’ll see. So people say, yeah, that's a very good idea, because it is like, Derech Eretz Kadmah La’Torah. First, work on your middos, to be a nice person, well educated, and only afterwards can you be shayach to Torah. So this is real nonsense. Because middos have such a depth, which is far beyond everything we could imagine. And not only because they are complicated, because they are reaching a depth, which other things don't reach. We see that in the Cheit HaEgel. It was after Matan Torah, so they had Torah, they had mitzvos, they had Limud Torah, whatever you want. They had after Matan Tira, that was the matzev that they were shayach to תריג. And then they made the Golden Calf, and everything was gone. And the main issue in the Torah after this is how to make the Sh'chineh should be with them. After that, the, the Kheid was, Gheirob, that the Sh'chineh was mistalek. How can you do that, you know? How is that shayach? Because Aharon said, now I get a busheh, because I made the Cheit HaEgel. And Am Yisroel said, but the Sh'chineh didn't come out, said, now we see that it didn't help, nothing helps, because the Sh'chineh is gone. But they had Torah, they had Mitzvos, but that wasn't enough. So what did the Borei Olam do? The Borei Olam brought down Yud-Gimmel Middos of Rachamim. And it says: כל זמן שישראל חוטאין – יעשו לפני כסדר הזה, ואני מוחל להם. So the Rishonim already say, Oisin Lefonai Kaseider Hazeh, doesn't mean that you say the words, only you are doing the Middos. עושין, you are Rachum, Chanun, Erech Apayim, Rav Chesed, Emes. That's what you are, that's what you are behaving. And then the Borei Olam will be mechaper the avoines. That means that Middos are reaching beyond where mitzvos reach. Mitzvos were gone, Maten Torah was gone, Hashroas HaSh’chineh was gone; The purpose didn't occur, but Middos will do the job. So there we see that Middos are much deeper, much deeper than everything you could imagine. Much deeper. And this is our problem, we think Middos are a way of behavior. It's like a little bit of psychology, you know. You have to be a nice guy and you have to interact nicely with your neighbor, and you smile, and you have good Middos. And it's like Derech Eretz Kadmah Le’Torah. This is far from truth. And all the Middos, not only these Yud-Gimmel Middos, but all of them, they have an aspect which is way beyond where everything else is reaching. Middos are much, much deeper, and they reach a much deeper realm than what you think. That's what Middos do. And when we want to have a shaychess to Middos, with our avoideh, we have to relate to the Middos the way a Jew relates to Middos. That has to have a source. We have to have a makor where to draw that thing from. Because those are things which are way beyond our seichel , way beyond our understanding. When you open up, it appears like it’s a machlokes, even though I think otherwise, but I don't want to go into that. But when you see the Tomer Devorah, which he says you have to be in the Middos, like the Borei Olam, the Tomer Devorah immediately begins with the Yud-Gimmel Middos of Rachamim. That's what he begins. He doesn't begin that you have to be a nice man, a good person, behave nicely, speak the truth, Be responsible. He doesn't say that. He says Rachum, Chanun, and he says there things which are nearly indigestible. You know, when you begin that sefer, you see that those are Middos that you wouldn't think that you are obligated to do that. No one would think like this. But those are the Jewish Middos, and there he begins his sefer that you have to go in the ways of the Borei Olam, which this is the makor of our middos tovos. So the Sha’arei Kedushah from R’ Chaim Vital, he says a little bit different by the Arba Yesodos, and I don't want to go into that. There's no machlokes, if there can ever be a machlokes when dealing with such things, I could show you how the Sha’arei Kedushah also says that middos are way beyond your seichel, but that's not our Inyan now. Only by the Tomer Devorah, you see that explicitly, that he begins Middos in a realm where your seichel is not really holding there. That's way beyond because that's what Middos are. They are rooted in a place way beyond the seichel; we'll see that later. We have to work on that.","output":"I'd like to delve into the concept of \\"middos,\\" which many earnestly speak about improving upon — and whether in a general fashion or regarding specific traits, remains to be seen. People often commend such efforts, citing the adage \\"Derech Eretz Kadmah La’Torah.\\" They argue that first one must refine their middos, become a mentsh, well-mannered, and only then are they zocha to a genuine kesher with Torah. However, this perspective is a gross simplification. The profundity of middos is immeasurable, transcending complexity; they touch upon a depth unattainable by other facets of avodas Hashem. Consider the incident of the Cheit HaEgel. Bnei Yisrael experienced Matan Torah, were exposed to mitzvos, and engaged in Limud Torah — they had all the components necessary for a shaychus to the תריג. Yet, following the creation of the Golden Calf, it was as though everything evaporated. The central challenge thereafter was restoring the Shechinah's presence, for with the Cheit, it had retreated, a Gehrobeh that seemed insurmountable. How is such a yiddische paradox conceivable? Aharon HaKohen felt profound bushah for his role in the Cheit, and Klal Yisroel despaired, believing that without the Shechinah's manifest presence, no endeavor held value. Despite their immersion in Torah and mitzvah observance, it was insufficient. It was the manifestation of the Yud-Gimmel Middos Harachamim that provided the remedy. The Rishonim clarify that \\"Oisin Lefonai Kaseider Hazeh\\" entails embodying the Middos — to embody rachamim, chanun, erech apayim, and so forth. It is through emulating these divine qualities that one merits atonement. Thus, the reach of middos extends further than mitzvah observance alone. Even when Mitzvos and Hashroas HaShechinah seemed lost, adhering to middos restored what was lost. This illustrates that the essence of middos penetrates far deeper than one might comprehend. Our error lies in perceiving middos merely as a pattern of behavior, a touch of psychology perhaps. Being a \\"nice person,\\" showing a warm smile, exercising derech eretz — these are perceived as preludes to Torah. Yet this perception strays from the emes. It's not only the Yud-Gimmel Middos, but all middos harbor an element far more profound than we assume. When we, in our avodas Hashem, pursue a shaychus with middos, we must engage with them in a uniquely Jewish context, sourcing our understanding from a root that transcends our seichel. While delving into the topic might elicit machlokes in interpretation — though my inclination is to disagree — I prefer not to dwell on these disputes. However, the sefer \\"Tomer Devorah\\" tackles middos head-on, beginning with the Yud-Gimmel Middos Harachamim, not with societal courtesies. It describes expectations that, at first glance, might seem beyond our obligations. Yet, these are the precise middos that define Jewish character, and with these, the author of Tomer Devorah initiates his sefer, directing us to walk in the ways of the Borei Olam, from whence our middos tovos derive. In contrast, the \\"Sha’arei Kedushah\\" by R’ Chaim Vital offers a slightly different perspective on the Arba Yesodos. It's not a machlokes per se, as the concept is consistently beyond understanding. I could demonstrate how Sha’arei Kedushah too attests to the supra-rational nature of middos, but that is not our present focus. Explicitly in Tomer Devorah, we witness that middos operate in a sphere beyond our finite seichel. This crucial understanding — that middos are rooted far beyond the grasp of our intellect — is something we must recognize and toil in."},{"instruction":"Do you know the game marvel snap?","output":"Yes, \\"Marvel Snap\\" is a digital collectible card game based on the Marvel Comics universe.

Este es el lugar donde puedes personalizar la apariencia de tus cartas de Anki, incluyendo cómo y dónde se muestran las líneas vacías.

Aquí hay un par de métodos que podrías usar dependiendo de lo que estés tratando de lograr: 1. **Usar la etiqueta \`<br>\`** La forma más sencilla de añadir una línea vacía es insertar una etiqueta de salto de línea \`<br>\` en el HTML donde quieras que aparezca la línea vacía. Por ejemplo: \`\`\`html <div>{{Front}}</div> <br> <div>{{Back}}</div> \`\`\` 2. **Usar CSS para añadir espacio** Si lo que quieres es más bien un margen o un espacio entre elementos, podrías usar CSS para añadir un \`margin\` o \`padding\`. Por ejemplo: \`\`\`html <div style=\\"margin-bottom: 20px;\\">{{Front}}</div> <div>{{Back}}</div> \`\`\` O definir una clase en la sección de estilos y aplicarla al elemento: \`\`\`html <style> .espacio-inferior { margin-bottom: 20px; } </style> <div class=\\"espacio-inferior\\">{{Front}}</div> <div>{{Back}}</div> \`\`\` 3. **Insertar una etiqueta de párrafo vacía** Otra opción es insertar un párrafo \`<p>\` sin contenido, a veces esto puede ser suficiente para crear una separación visible: \`\`\`html <div>{{Front}}</div> <p></p> <div>{{Back}}</div> \`\`\` Recuerda que cuando modifiques la plantilla, debes previsualizar la tarjeta para asegurarte de que el cambio se vea como deseas.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house; the source of the returning woman's urge shouldn't be induced by illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance nor spicy food), for a very long comedic scene in a Black Sitcom TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A youth girl (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a junior; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief and muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern as the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman ponders out loud about the odor again. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if the odor is coming from the returning woman. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. The present woman proceeds to sniff nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman rhetorically asks if the odor is a result of the returning woman pooping in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants and for how dirty pooping in her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so childish like pooping in her pants is inconceivable. The present woman proceeds to disappointedly ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and finished the whole bowel movement in her pants. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and push the poop into her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to release her bowels and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. The returning woman adds that she had to do this even if it meant that she would fill her pants. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish moving her bowels in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release her bowels, even if they were released in her pants. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly expresses her disgust and admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitance by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously ridicule the returning woman over the nastiness of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is inconceivably nasty and reminds the returning woman that the returning woman shouldn't have gotten herself in the first place into a situation where she ends up pooping in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure. The present woman continues by tauntingly recounting that the returning woman stood there and filled her pants with what looked like the contentment of a child. Adding on her last comment, the present woman verbally presumes with mocking disgust that just like the returning woman enjoys having her pants full of so much poop, the returning woman probably enjoys the terrible odor that is emanating from her pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that based on the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by tauntingly scolding the returning woman for how terribly smelly the returning woman is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - making the present woman have to endure the returning woman’s smelly and soiled pants.","output":"FADE IN: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY A quiet, cozy suburban street with neatly trimmed lawns and children playing. The warmth of a late afternoon sun bathes the landscape. JANAE (17), athletic, hair pulled back in a tight ponytail, dressed in basketball shorts and an oversized hoodie, walks briskly toward the door of her family's single-story brick house. The pace of her steps and tension in her body show an evident sense of urgency. As Janae reaches the front door, she pats her pockets, a look of horror crossing her face as she realizes her keys are missing. She begins to knock frantically. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS On the other side of the door, we hear someone moving. This is MONICA (40s), Janae's mother, stylish in a tastefully casual ensemble. She exudes warmth and authority. Monica walks towards the door, concern etched on her face. MONICA (through the door) Janae, baby, what's all the ruckus about? JANAE (out of breath) Please, Momma, just open up! Monica takes her time unlocking the door, fumbling with the deadbolt and chain. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door opens and Janae bolts forward but Monica, puzzled by Janae's behavior, stands in her path. MONICA (concerned) Hold on, girl! What's the fire? Janae tries to dodge past her, each movement edged with quiet desperation. JANAE (beads of sweat on the forehead) Mom, not now, please! I gotta get in! They tussle gently, Monica gripping her arms, Janae ducking and weaving, almost dancing. Suddenly, Janae's face contorts; her body tenses and she releases a soft groan. She goes stiff in Monica's grip. Monica, perplexed, loosens her hold. MONICA (alarmed) Janae? What’s going on with you? Janae gently steps back and, with a heave of resignation, she slightly bends her knees, easing herself into a more accommodating position. She begins to grunt softly, a mix of effort and unmistakable relief. MONICA (confused) Baby, why are you standing like--? But Janae doesn't reply adequately, her words mere mutters between the audible signs of relief. Hesitantly, curiosity tinged with concern, Monica sniffs the air once, and then with dawning realization, again. MONICA (noses crinkling) Girl... what in the world is that smell? In the silence that follows, Janae looks up, facing her mother with a sheepish expression. The stench becomes unignorable, and Monica's face contorts as she puts two and two together. MONICA (disgusted) Janae... is that... is that coming from you? Janae does not reply, instead gesturing weakly toward the interior of the house. Monica sniff-tests the air closer to Janae and physically recoils. MONICA (retching) You—did you just... in your pants? Janae nods ever so slightly, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. MONICA (mockingly shocked) Oh lord, child! Get inside and—Watch your step! Janae waddles past her mother, subjected to her continued bewilderment. Monica grabs her arm, freezing her in place. MONICA (holding her nose) Don’t you drip none of that mess on my floors! Silence. Janae stands mortified, her hands still cupped around the seat of her pants. MONICA (taunting) And to think, my grown child straight-up pooping her pants. You ever gonna grow up? Janae begins to shake off her initial shock, her mood shifting to playful defiance. JANAE (wryly) Well if you hadn't taken a whole lifetime at the door, none of this would've happened! Monica's expression hardens as she rejects the excuse. MONICA (indignant) That ain’t no reason for... (gestures to Janae’s soiled pants) this mess. Ain't no baby here! Janae’s voice raises as she insists on her urgent need, her hands now patting the bulging fabric at her rear, a wry smile dancing on her lips. JANAE (jokingly stubborn) I was pressed, Ma! What you wanted me to do? Monica pinches her nose, her disgust apparent, but a hint of a playful smirk arises on her face. MONICA (mockingly) Well, since you seem to feel so good about it, let’s take a closer look at what got you so happy. She spins Janae around for a closer inspection, firing off a barrage of mockingly disgusted comments. MONICA You enjoyed it that much, huh? Might as well put on a diaper next time! JANAE (as if sharing a secret) Ma, it was an emergency! And it did feel... it felt like— Monica interjects. MONICA (interrupting) Oh, hush up, child. You stink to high heaven! Get to the bathroom. Now. JANAE (coyly) You gonna change my 'poopy diaper' for me? Monica responds to the insolence with dramatic playful disgust, pressing on the mess and nudging Janae into the bathroom. MONICA (hand covering her nose, aghast) Get in there with your nasty self! Janae exclaims as Monica forcefully squashes the bulge in her pants, her expression a complex mix of repulsion and amusement. JANAE (yelling in disgust) Ma! You're making it worse! Monica leaves the bathroom, still pressing her nostrils, her voice still filled with disbelief. MONICA (to herself) Grown woman... got me treating her like she's still in diapers. Lord, help me. Monica walks down the hallway, shaking her head in disbelief as the bathroom door shuts. CUT TO BLACK."},{"instruction":"What you produced is very good.

FAMILY HOUSE - DAY A suburban street pulsates with the everyday cheer of children playing and neighbors chatting across fences. Janae’s family house stands with friendly charm, inviting with its porch swing and potted plants. Janae (17), embodies youthful energy with a tomboy flair, her hair a braided cascade of practicality. Her attire, a high school track team sweatshirt and baggy cargo pants, is unassuming and worn-in. She approaches the house with determination, her jaw set, strides purposeful—each step betraying a silent, internal plea for haste. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The sound of keys jangling is absent as Janae pats her pockets frantically. The discovery of her misplaced keys escalates into a crisis. She pounds at the door, her knocking rhythm desperate. Monica (40s), the epitome of maternal elegance with her modern afro and work-from-home chic, hears the commotion from within. Concern etches her face as she nears the door. MONICA (through the door, voice uplifted in playfulness and mild concern) Janae, honey, you tryin’ to knock the door down? JANAE (breathless, intermingling panic with polite restraint) Mom, please. Open up quick! Monica, reassured but slow on the uptake, fumbles with the series of locks—a distracted maestro conducting an off-beat symphony of bolts and chains. INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door finally swings open, revealing Janae, her face a canvas of conflicting emotions—urge, anxiety, relief at the door's opening, annoyance at its delayed delivery. Janae tries to slip past her mother, whose concern manifests in a blockade of gentle, but firm, maternal curiosity. MONICA (teasing curiosity laced with concern) Hold up, Janae! You runnin' from someone? JANAE (words rushed, dabbled with discomfort) No time, Mom! Please, I gotta-- Monica, sensing the urgency, still isn’t convinced. She holds her ground, a maternal gatekeeper seeking proper answers. JANAE (teetering on the brink of desperation) Mom, MOVE! The present woman holds firm, her hand on Janae’s arm not just a physical barrier but an expression of concern. MONICA (warily) Now, wait a minute... Tell me what's goin' on first. The exchange grows heated, the edges of their words frayed with confusion and unspoken panic. Janae’s face contorts; her body succumbs to an uncontrollable clench. Monica’s hands loosen as she registers the shift, her face a tableau of startled compassion. MONICA (with rising alarm) Baby girl, what's wrong? Janae, her back against the doorframe for support, squats ever so slightly, grimacing—embracing the unavoidable. MONICA (struggling for comprehension) Why are you—? Janae? Janae’s response is a series of grunts, each punctuated by a pause of realization—of the inevitable act underway. Monica, her eyebrows knitting together in confusion, inhales a clue that hangs suspiciously in the air. MONICA (nosing the air tentatively at first, then with realization) What in the...? Janae lifts her head slowly, her expression a wash of guilt and resignation. Her eyes meet Monica's, a sheepish acknowledgement of the situation. Monica connects the dots—a pattern emerges amidst her fading skepticism. MONICA (with disgust and astonishment) Oh, Lord, Janae—did you just... Before Janae can utter a syllable, Monica’s maternal instincts command her to sniff closer, the physical response of revulsion is visceral. MONICA (recoiling, pushing her words through a clenched jaw) ...In your pants? Right here? With a nod, Janae bypasses words, pleading with body language for passage. Monica, broadsided by the unfathomable, motions her daughter inside, the stench spurring her to swift, decisive action. MONICA (waving her away, voice tinged with humor and revulsion) Move, go on—watch where you're steppin'! Janae's gait is an awkward, contained waddle as she inches past her mother, her hands forming a makeshift cradle at her backside. Monica halts her, the imperative paramount. MONICA (nose pinched between a finger and thumb) Now you better make sure nothin' drops, y'hear? This ain’t cute. JANAE (stifling mortification) I know, Mom—I know! Monica can’t resist prodding deeper, mocking disappointment intermixed with a flicker of amusement. MONICA (voice layered with sarcasm and disbelief) Grown up and still messin' yourself. Janae, when you plannin' on actin' your age? Janae’s candor returns, her defenses relaxing into a chiding retort. JANAE (cheeky, half-heartedly apologetic) Shoot, if someone hadn’t taken forever to let me in, we wouldn't be here now, would we? Monica denies the evasive logic with a roll of her eyes and click of her tongue. MONICA (firmly, mockingly dismissive) That ain't no excuse for this—this spectacle. Across Janae's face, the playfulness fades as urgency resurfaces. Her hand briefly reassesses the state of her cargo pants, her lips twisting into a pained grin. JANAE (mischievously pleading) I had to go, Ma! Had to make it all out. You know how it is. Spying her daughter's investigates her mishap, Monica's face contorts in exaggerated disgust layered over real empathy. MONICA (mimicking repulsion) Baby, I love you, but you nasty. Now, show me what we're dealin' with here. Despite Janae's flimsy resistance, Monica inspects her daughter's soiled attire with a ghoulish curiosity. She can't help but toss a barb dressed as wit. MONICA (playfully chiding) Feels good, don't it? Sure looks like you're wearin' it well. JANAE (mock defense, a reluctant grin peeking through) It ain't like that, Mom. When you gotta go, you gotta go! MONICA (exasperated laughter with a side of scorn) Oh, honey, you and your mess. You somethin' else. With a reprimanding finger wag, she motions for a direction—for progress amidst the absurdity. MONICA (with mock sternness, still reeling in disbelief) Let's get you cleaned up—can’t have you lingerin’ here, smellin' like a landfill. Janae ambles off under Monica’s odor-aggrieved escort, who helps orchestrate an unsteady ballet of waddles and holds, careful not to dislodge Janae's burdensome cargo. JANAE (with genuine concern, half-giggling) Ma, I swear I can feel it shiftin'—you better not let it fall! Monica’s efforts intensify, a balancing act of disgust and assistance, a loose grip on persistent grumbles about the foul vicinity. MONICA (fanning away the smell) Child, if you drip any of that, I swear... They reach the bathroom threshold and Janae's impish side sparks anew. She halts, a laborious twinkle in her eye. JANAE (coquettishly absurd) So, Momma...you gon' help me change outta this 'diaper'? Monica’s patience shatters into playful retaliation, a response that is both maternal and steeped in facetious retribution. She heaves her daughter over the line with a squelching grasp, nose crinkled in theatric repulsion. MONICA (urgency eclipsing the playful scorn) Go on—get in there this instant! As the uncomfortable truth of the situation spreads with the squish of soiled fabric, Janae’s yelps mingle with stifled laughter. JANAE (half-disgusted, half-amused) Ma! It's all...ugh—squishing around! With a final maternal shove, Janae stumbles into the bathroom, Monica shaking her head in simulated horror and genuine love. MONICA (admonishing, satisfied with making her point) Should've thought twice about teasing, shouldn't ya? As the bathroom door closes, Monica takes a moment, still pinching her nostrils closed, to reflect on her daughter’s unanticipated ordeal. MONICA (to herself, a half-smile of exhausted exasperation) Grown woman makin' her poor momma deal with all this foolishness... FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Create a well-thought-out and meaningful letter for NFL legend Dan Marino, in an effort to appeal to his humanitarian side and convince him to want to visit the Boca Raton Achievement Center, where I (Cameron McCaffrey) currently do volunteer work at the front desk. Make note of how I met him in 2016 at the opening of the Microsoft Store at the Town Center in Boca Raton, and how he told me about his autistic son Michael, which meant a lot to me as I was diagnosed with Asperger's at an early age. Also note how back in October 2023, I lost both of my parents within nine days, and have been working with various people (including Jim and Marta Batmasian, and BRAC executive director Evelyn Falconer) to get back on my feet and make something of myself. Demonstrate an awareness of and respect for Marino's achievements on the football field, as well as his accomplishments outside of the NFL, and point out all of the ways in which students would benefit from his presence at the achievement center. Above all, write the letter in such a way as to maximize the odds that should he see and read it he would not only respond but commit to visiting the Boca Raton Achievement Center, and make it clear what an honor it would be to have him here. Use information from the following site as a point of reference when and where applicable: https://bocaratonachievement.com/","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, Zip Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date] Mr. Dan Marino [Dan Marino’s Address or The Dan Marino Foundation Address] [City, State, Zip Code] Dear Mr. Marino, I hope this letter finds you in great health and high spirits. My name is Cameron McCaffrey, and I am currently a volunteer at the Boca Raton Achievement Center (BRAC), where I have the privilege of helping individuals as they strive to overcome challenges and achieve their dreams. Your storied career as an NFL legend and your commendable work as a philanthropist have long been sources of inspiration to me, and it is with utmost respect and admiration that I am reaching out today. We briefly met in 2016 - a memory I cherish deeply - at the opening of the Microsoft Store at the Town Center in Boca Raton. During that encounter, you shared with me the story of your son Michael and his journey with autism. That conversation was profoundly meaningful to me, having been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at an early age. Your openness and the impactful work of The Dan Marino Foundation in advocating for individuals with autism and developmental disabilities deeply resonated with me and further inspired my volunteer work. Tragically, in October 2023, I faced the heartbreaking loss of both my parents within the span of nine days. This event turned my world upside down, but with the support of remarkable individuals like Jim and Marta Batmasian, and BRAC’s dedicated executive director Evelyn Falconer, I have been working tirelessly to regain my footing, supporting others, and building a life centered around purpose and service. It is with the support of this community that I strive to fulfill a vision akin to the values held dear by your own foundation. The BRAC supports a diverse cohort of individuals, empowering them to develop skills, forge career paths, and contribute back to society. Your presence at the center would not only be an honor of the highest order, but it would also resonate deeply with our students and provide invaluable motivation as they witness the embodiment of success in both professional and personal realms. Your awe-inspiring journey from the football field to becoming a beacon of hope and support for individuals with developmental challenges stands as a testament to the power of commitment, kindness, and diligent effort—principles we endeavor to instill in our students daily. A visit from you would offer the students unique insights and inspire them to continue pushing beyond perceived limitations. Moreover, your understanding and perspective as a parent engaged with the cause could impart a message of encouragement that many parents of our students need to hear—a message filled with empathy and strength. Mr. Marino, you have touched countless lives with your prowess on the gridiron and your philanthropic initiatives off the field. We, at the Boca Raton Achievement Center, would be deeply honored to welcome you and share the profound impact that your advocacy can have on our community. We envision a visit that would not only highlight your accomplishments but also celebrate the potential and tenacity of our students. I look forward to facilitating a convenient time for your visit, brimming with hope that this request will resonate with the same spirit of generosity and community involvement that you've exemplified throughout your esteemed career. Thank you very much for considering this invitation. I am available at your convenience to discuss any details or answer questions you may have. The opportunity to welcome you to the Boca Raton Achievement Center would indeed be one of the highest accolades for our community. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey"},{"instruction":"Я сейчас напомню тебе диалог: Пользователь: Переведи текст на английский \\"\\"\\" Число людей, пользующихся интернетом, достигло поразительных 5.8 миллиарда, что составляет 72,06% от общего населения Земли, подчеркивая быстрый рост и важность интернет-технологий в современном обществе.
