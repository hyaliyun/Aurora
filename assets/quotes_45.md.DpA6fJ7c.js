He again chooses two loose ends at random and joins them, and so on, until there are no loose ends. Find, with proof, the expected value of the number of loops George ends up with.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**: George starts with 6 ropes, each having 2 loose ends, making a total of 12 loose ends. 2. **First Pairing**: When George picks two loose ends at random and ties them together, there are two possibilities:    - He ties two ends of the same rope, forming a loop.    - He ties ends from different ropes, reducing the number of ropes by one. 3. **Probability of Forming a Loop**:     - The probability that the first two ends he picks form a loop is given by the ratio of the number of ways to pick two ends from the same rope to the total number of ways to pick any two ends.    - There are 6 ropes, each with 2 ends, so there are (6 times binom{2}{2} = 6) ways to pick two ends from the same rope.    - The total number of ways to pick any two ends from 12 is (binom{12}{2} = frac{12 times 11}{2} = 66).    - Therefore, the probability of forming a loop on the first pick is (frac{6}{66} = frac{1}{11}). 4. **Subsequent Pairings**: After each pairing, the number of loose ends decreases by 2. The process continues until there are no loose ends left. Each time George ties two ends, the probability of forming a loop changes because the number of remaining loose ends changes. 5. **Expected Number of Loops**:     - Let (E_n) be the expected number of loops when starting with (n) loose ends.    - Initially, (E_{12}) is what we need to find.    - The expected number of loops formed in each step can be calculated by summing the probabilities of forming a loop at each step. 6. **Summing the Probabilities**:    - The probability of forming a loop at each step is (frac{1}{2k-1}) where (k) is the number of pairs of loose ends remaining.    - For (n = 12) loose ends, we have 6 pairs, so the expected number of loops is:      [      E_{12} = sum_{k=1}^{6} frac{1}{2k-1}      ]    - This sum is:      [      E_{12} = frac{1}{11} + frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{1}      ] 7. **Calculating the Sum**:    - We calculate each term:      [      frac{1}{11} approx 0.0909, quad frac{1}{9} approx 0.1111, quad frac{1}{7} approx 0.1429, quad frac{1}{5} = 0.2, quad frac{1}{3} approx 0.3333, quad frac{1}{1} = 1      ]    - Summing these values:      [      0.0909 + 0.1111 + 0.1429 + 0.2 + 0.3333 + 1 approx 1.8782      ] The final answer is (boxed{1.878})."},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, P is the midpoint of the line AD in triangle ABC.

Find the value of m+n. A: frac{1}{4} B: 2 C: frac{1}{2} D: 4","output":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the relationship between points P, M, and N on triangle triangle ABC. Since P is the midpoint of AD, and MN intersects AB at M and AC at N, we can express the vectors in terms of each other. 1. We know that overrightarrow{AP}=lambda overrightarrow{AM}+mu overrightarrow{AN}, where lambda +mu =1. This is because P, M, and N are collinear, and lambda and mu represent the scalar multiples that relate overrightarrow{AM} and overrightarrow{AN} to overrightarrow{AP}. 2. Given that P is the midpoint of AD, we can express overrightarrow{AP} as frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}. Since D is a point that makes AD a line segment within the triangle, we can further decompose overrightarrow{AD} into overrightarrow{AB}+overrightarrow{AC}, leading to overrightarrow{AP}=frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{AD}=frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC}. 3. The problem provides that overrightarrow{AB}=moverrightarrow{AM} and overrightarrow{AC}=noverrightarrow{AN}. Substituting these into the expression for overrightarrow{AP}, we get overrightarrow{AP}=frac{1}{4}moverrightarrow{AM}+frac{1}{4}noverrightarrow{AN}. This implies that lambda =frac{1}{4}m and mu =frac{1}{4}n because they are the coefficients of overrightarrow{AM} and overrightarrow{AN} in the expression for overrightarrow{AP}. 4. Since we know lambda +mu =1, substituting the values of lambda and mu gives us frac{1}{4}m + frac{1}{4}n = 1. Simplifying this equation, we find that m+n=4.

The retailer marked up the shirt by 80%, so the initial price after the markup is ( P + 0.80P = 1.80P ). To achieve a 100% markup, the price would need to be ( P + 1.00P = 2.00P ). The retailer needs to increase the price by 3 to achieve this 100% markup. So, the difference between the 100% markup price and the 80% markup price is 3: ( 2.00P - 1.80P = 0.20P = 3 ) Now, we can solve for ( P ): ( 0.20P = 3 ) ( P = 3 / 0.20 ) ( P = 15 ) So, the initial price of the shirt after the 80% markup is ( 1.80P ): ( 1.80P = 1.80 times 15 ) ( 1.80P = 27 ) Therefore, the initial price of the shirt after the 80% markup is boxed{27} ."},{"instruction":"The old rich man divided all his silver dollars among his four sons before he passed away.

We assume that a leq b leq c. Firstly, we need to prove that K cannot be equal to frac{9}{11}.  To analyze this, we note the following: - For a geq 4, K leq frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} < frac{9}{11}. Thus, it suffices to examine the cases where a leq 3.  Case 1: a = 1 If a = 1, then: K = frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = 1 + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}. Since frac{9}{11} < 1, this case is impossible. Thus, a neq 1.  Case 2: a = 2 If a = 2, then: K = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}. We need K = frac{9}{11}, hence: frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{9}{11}. This implies: frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{9}{11} - frac{1}{2} = frac{9}{11} - frac{5.5}{11} = frac{3.5}{11} = frac{7}{22}. For b > 2: - If b = 3, then we need: frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22}. Simplifying, frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22} - frac{1}{3} = frac{21}{66} - frac{22}{66} = -frac{1}{66}, which is not possible. - If b = 4, then we need: frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22}. Simplifying, frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22} - frac{1}{4} = frac{14}{44} - frac{11}{44} = frac{3}{44}, which gives c = frac{44}{3}, not an integer. - Similarly, for b = 5, frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22}, we get frac{1}{c} = frac{7}{22} - frac{1}{5} = frac{35}{110} - frac{22}{110} = frac{13}{110}, and c = frac{110}{13}, not an integer. - For b geq 7, we have: K = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} leq frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{7} + frac{1}{8} = frac{11}{14} < frac{9}{11}.  Case 3: a = 3 If a = 3, then: K = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}. We need K = frac{9}{11}, hence: frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{9}{11} This implies: frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} = frac{9}{11} - frac{1}{3} = frac{27}{33} - frac{11}{33} = frac{16}{33}. For b geq 3: - If b = 3, then we need: frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{c} = frac{16}{33}, we get frac{1}{c} = frac{16}{33} - frac{1}{3} = frac{16}{33} - frac{11}{33} = frac{5}{33}, and c = frac{33}{5}, not an integer. - If b = 4, then we need: frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{c} = frac{16}{33}. Simplifying, frac{1}{c} = frac{16}{33} - frac{1}{4} = frac{64}{132} - frac{33}{132} = frac{31}{132}, and c = frac{132}{31}, not an integer. - For b geq 5, we have: K = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} leq frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} < frac{9}{11}. We have exhausted all possibilities for a leq 3, and in none of these cases could we find K = frac{9}{11}. Therefore, K cannot be frac{9}{11}. Now, consider the question if there exists any rational number between frac{41}{42} and 1 which can be represented as a sum of the reciprocals of three positive integers.  Firstly, recall: frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{7} = frac{41}{42}.  This is one such number which fits between frac{41}{42} and 1. To examine the possible values of frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}, note that if a geq 3, then: K leq frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} = 1. Also, we checked previously in cases where a = 2 or a = 1 these don't produce values within (frac{41}{42}, 1). Therefore: - For a = 2, and b = 3, c geq 7: C = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} +  frac{1}{c} Since 41/42 =0.976... that will be 1 - frac{1}{42} we'll have c =7. -  Any additional trials for values will not fit within the bound.

Therefore, the total number of edges (e) in the polyhedron can be computed as:        [     e = frac{24 + 48}{2} = 36     ] 3. **Using Euler's Polyhedron Formula**: Euler's formula for a convex polyhedron relates the number of faces (f), vertices (v), and edges (e) by:     [     v - e + f = 2     ]     Given that the polyhedron has 14 faces ((6 + 8 = 14)) and we calculated 36 edges, we can find the number of vertices (v):     [     v - 36 + 14 = 2 implies v = 24     ] 4. **Distribution of Faces Meeting at a Vertex**: Since no two squares share a vertex and since the polyhedron is convex, the distribution of faces at any vertex involves one square and two hexagons. This is due to the geometric properties of regular polygons and the constraints given. 5. **Constructing the Polyhedron from an Octahedron**:     - Consider a regular octahedron (which has 8 faces that are equilateral triangles). Each triangle is cut into a regular hexagon by truncating the vertices.     - Truncating a vertex of the octahedron transforms the vertex into a square face. Each original triangle face becomes a regular hexagon. This leads us to the polyhedron described in the problem. 6. **Volume Calculation by Truncation**:     - When a regular octahedron of edge length (3) units is truncated, small tetrahedral volumes are removed corresponding to the vertices.     - Each truncated equilateral triangle face becomes a regular hexagon.     - The resulting volume also retains a structured relationship known from the truncation properties. 7. **Volume Calculation**:     - The volume (V_0) of the original octahedron with edge length (a) is:       [       V_0 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3} a^3       ]       For an octahedron with edge length 3:       [       V_0 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3} times 3^3 = 9sqrt{2}       ]     - Upon truncation, the truncated part can be considered as consisting of small octahedrons:       [       V_{text{polyhedron}} = 27 times frac{sqrt{2}}{3} - 3 times frac{sqrt{2}}{3}       ]       Simplifying the above expression:       [       V = 27 times frac{sqrt{2}}{3} - 3 times frac{sqrt{2}}{3} = left( 27 - 3 right) times frac{sqrt{2}}{3} = 24 times frac{sqrt{2}}{3} = 8sqrt{2}       ] Thus, the volume of the polyhedron is: [ boxed{8sqrt{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"w many even naturalnumber factors divisible by 5 does n = 2^3 cdot 5^2 cdot 11^1 have?","output":"Every factor of n is in the form 2^a cdot 5^b cdot 11^c where 0 leq a leq 3, 0 leq b leq 2, and 0 leq c leq 1.

For the right-hand part, 3x - 12 < 8 3x < 20 x < frac{20}{3} Since x must be an integer (as you can't have a fraction of a child), x must be greater than 4 and less than frac{20}{3}.

If f(x) is monotonic on mathbb{R}, then the minimum value of the real number a is ______.","output":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. We are given that when x > 0, f(x) = e^x + a. To maintain the odd function property, when x < 0, f(x) should equal -f(-x) which gives f(x) = -e^{-x} - a. Now, we need to check the monotonicity of f(x) on mathbb{R}. 1. For x > 0, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:    f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x + a) = e^x    Since e^x > 0 for all x, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). 2. At x = 0, since f(x) is continuous and odd, f(0) = 0. Thus, the value of f(x) at x = 0 is determined solely by the constant a. Therefore, f(0) = 0 + a = a. 3. For x < 0, we use the property of odd functions to infer:    f(x) = -e^{-x} - a    The derivative of f(x) with respect to x in this case is:    f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(-e^{-x} - a) = e^{-x}    Since e^{-x} > 0 for all x < 0, f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 0) as well. For f(x) to be a monotonic function on mathbb{R}, it must be increasing throughout the whole domain. This means that as we approach x = 0 from the negative side, the value of f(x) must not exceed the value of f(x) at x = 0. The maximum value of f(x) for x < 0 would then be f(0) = a. Therefore, we need the following inequality to be true: -1 - a leq a This simplifies to: -1 leq 2a a geq -frac{1}{2} However, at x = 0, for f(x) to not have a local extremum given it is increasing on both sides of x=0, the function value at x=0 should match the one-sided limit as x approaches 0 from the negative side. Therefore: a = -1-a 2a = -1 a = -frac{1}{2} But a = -1/2 does not satisfy f'(x) > 0 for x just less than 0 because it would make f(x) not increasing at that point. Thus, we need: a > -frac{1}{2} Since we are asked for the minimum value of a, the least value that satisfies the inequality and ensures f(x) is monotonic on mathbb{R} is a = -1/2, but we have to exclude it and take a value just greater than it.

Completing the square for both x and y in the equation x^2 + y^2 - 2x - 4y + 4 = 0, we obtain (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 1. This reveals that the circle has a center at (1, 2) and a radius R = 1. Now consider two cases for the tangent line: **Case 1**: The slope of the tangent line is undefined (vertical line). If the tangent line is vertical, it must be of the form x = 0, because it passes through the origin. This is indeed a tangent to the circle because it touches the circle exactly at the point (0,0), which also satisfies the circle's equation. **Case 2**: The slope of the tangent line k exists. In this case, we can write the equation of the tangent line as y = kx, which can also be expressed as kx - y = 0 in standard linear form. The perpendicular distance d from the center of the circle (1, 2) to the line kx - y = 0 can be calculated using the formula d = frac{|ak + b - c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where ax + by + c = 0 is the equation of the line. So for our line we have d = frac{|k(1) - 1(2)|}{sqrt{k^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|k - 2|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. Since the line is tangent to the circle, d must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. Therefore, we have: frac{|k - 2|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = 1 This implies: |k - 2| = sqrt{1 + k^2} Squaring both sides of the equation, we get: (k - 2)^2 = 1 + k^2 This simplifies to: k^2 - 4k + 4 = 1 + k^2 Canceling k^2 from both sides and solving for k, we find: -4k + 4 = 1  4k = 3  k = frac{3}{4}  Therefore, the equation of the tangent line with a defined slope is y = frac{3}{4}x.

Claim 1: In a tournament with 2^n participants, the number of participants who have k points after m rounds (denoted as f(m, k)) is given by: [  f(m, k) = 2^{n-m} cdot binom{m}{k}  ] where ( m leq n ) and ( k in {0, ldots, m} ). # Proof by Induction: 1. **Base Case**:    - If ( m = 0 ) (i.e., before the tournament starts), then ( k = 0 ) and ( f(0, 0) = 2^n ) as all participants have 0 points. 2. **Inductive Step**:    - Assume the formula is true for some ( m ) such that ( m < n ):       [      f(m, k) = 2^{n-m} cdot binom{m}{k}      ]    - We need to prove it for ( m + 1 ).    After ( m+1 ) rounds:    - The group of participants with 0 wins and no losses will be halved:      [      f(m+1, 0) = frac{1}{2} f(m, 0) = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^{n-m} = 2^{n-(m+1)} cdot binom{m+1}{0}      ]    - Similarly, the group with all wins and no losses will also be halved:      [      f(m+1, m+1) = frac{1}{2} f(m, m) = frac{1}{2} cdot 2^{n-m} cdot 1 = 2^{n-(m+1)} cdot binom{m+1}{m+1}      ]    - For ( k in {1, ldots, m} ), the participants who have ( k ) points after ( m+1 ) rounds can come from those who had ( k ) points and lost their match or those who had ( k-1 ) points and won:      [      f(m+1, k) = frac{1}{2} f(m, k) + frac{1}{2} f(m, k-1) = 2^{n-m-1} left( binom{m}{k} + binom{m}{k-1} right) = 2^{n-(m+1)} cdot binom{m+1}{k}      ]      (using Pascal's identity for binomial coefficients). Thus, the formula holds by induction.  Claim 2: The tournament can be decomposed into two independent tournaments: one with 2^n participants and another with 6 participants. **Reasoning**: In each round, pair only participants within the same group. Hence, after completing all rounds, the results from both groups can be combined.  Total Count: - From the first group (with 2^n participants), using Claim 1, after 7 rounds, those with 4 points will be:   [   2^{n-7} cdot binom{7}{4} = 2^{n-7} cdot 35   ] - From the second group (with 6 participants), using the configuration of score distribution after 7 rounds (i.e., 6 rightarrow (3, 3) rightarrow (2, 3, 1) rightarrow (1, 3, 2) rightarrow (1, 2, 2, 1) rightarrow (1, 1, 2, 2) rightarrow (1, 1, 1, 2, 1) rightarrow (1, 1, 1, 1, 2)), we deduce that 2 participants will have 4 points. Thus, the total number of participants with 4 points after the seventh round is: [ 35 cdot 2^{n-7} + 2 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{35 cdot 2^{n-7} + 2} ]"},{"instruction":"During a school carnival activity, Class 6 of Senior 2 designed a game: in a box, there are 5 red balls and 5 white balls, which are identical except for the color.

This would be a combination of 10 balls taken 5 at a time, denoted as:  C_{10}^5  which represents the number of ways to select 5 balls out of 10 without regard to the order. Then, for winning outcomes, we either draw 4 red balls and 1 white ball or all 5 red balls. The number of ways to draw 4 red out of 5 and 1 white out of 5 is:  C_{5}^4 times C_{5}^1  and the number of ways to draw all 5 red balls is:  C_{5}^5  Thus, the total number of winning outcomes is the sum of these two specific cases:  C_{5}^4 cdot C_{5}^1 + C_{5}^5  Now, we'll calculate each term: - The number of combinations of 10 balls taken 5 at a time is:  C_{10}^5 = frac{10!}{5!(10-5)!} = 252  - The number of combinations of 5 red balls taken 4 at a time is:  C_{5}^4 = frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5  - The number of combinations of 5 white balls taken 1 at a time is:  C_{5}^1 = frac{5!}{1!(5-1)!} = 5  - Finally, the number of combinations of 5 red balls taken all 5 at a time is:  C_{5}^5 = frac{5!}{5!(5-5)!} = 1  We can now calculate the total number of winning outcomes:  5 cdot 5 + 1 = 26  Therefore, the probability of winning is the ratio of winning outcomes to total outcomes, which is:  P(text{winning}) = frac{26}{252} approx 0.103  So, rounding to three decimal places, the answer is:  boxed{0.103}"},{"instruction":"Given a gt 0, b gt 0, which of the following conditions can make the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b} equal to 4?

B: The given description for a cone is inaccurate because a cone is defined as the solid formed by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs (not just any side), implying the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the base.

The problem states that one of the asymptotes is tangent to the circle (x-6)^{2}+y^{2}=20. Without loss of generality, we can consider the positive asymptote for calculation: y=frac{b}{a}x. Given that the circle is tangent to the asymptote, the distance from the center of the circle, which is (6,0), to the line defined by the asymptote must be equal to the radius of the circle, sqrt{20}.

We know that c=6 and a=4, so c-a=2. Since PF_2 must be greater than or equal to 2, the valid solution is PF_2=17. Therefore, point P to F_2 has a distance of 17.  boxed{PF_2 = 17}"},{"instruction":"A certain high school has 500 students.

[      deg(g(x + m) - g(x)) = deg(g) - 1 geq 1      ]    - Thus, ( deg(h) = deg(g) - 1 geq 1 ) and ( h ) cannot be zero polynomial.    - ( h ) vanishes at ( 0, 1, ldots, n(m-1) - m ), indicating at least ( (n-1)(m-1) ) roots.    - Therefore:      [      deg(g) geq (n-1)(m-1) + 1 geq n      ] 5. **Conclusion:**    - This concludes that the total degree of the polynomial ( f ) is at least ( n ).    boxed{n}"},{"instruction":"The proposition exists x gt a, the inequality 2x+frac{1}{xa}＜2sqrt{2} about x is false.

This implies that for all x > a, the inequality 2x + frac{1}{x-a} geq 2sqrt{2} must hold true. Let's analyze the inequality step by step: 1. For x > a, we can rewrite the inequality as: [2x + frac{1}{x-a} = [2(x-a) + frac{1}{x-a}] + 2a] 2. Applying the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), we get: [2(x-a) + frac{1}{x-a} geq 2 times sqrt{2(x-a) cdot frac{1}{x-a}}] 3.

Therefore, we have: [2x + frac{1}{x-a} geq 2a + 2sqrt{2}] 6. The equality holds when 2(x-a) = frac{1}{x-a}, which leads to: [x = a + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}] 7.

A point (P) is chosen on a circle described around it such that the segment (CP) intersects the base of the diagonal of the trapezoid does not exceed the sum of the distances from the midpoints of its lateral sides to any point on the line (PL). 1. Let (E) be the midpoint of side (AB) and (F) be the midpoint of side (CD). According to the well-known lemma about the minimum sum of distances from two points to a line, we first need to show the equality of triangles (LE_1F) and (AGC). 2. Consider triangle (AGC). Since (ABCD) is an isosceles trapezoid with (AB = CD), it follows that     [     AG = GC     ]     because (A) and (G) are the endpoints of side (AB) and similar considerations hold for (C) and (G). 3. Note that the length (EL) in triangle (LE_1F) is equal to (AG) in triangle (AGC):     [     EL = AG = AB/2     ]     because (LE) is half the length of side (AB), similarly (AG) is also calculated due to symmetry.  4. Next, observe that:     [     LF = QC/2 = GC     ]     where (QC) is twice the length of the altitude drawn from point (Q) to (AB). This follows from the properties of isosceles trapezoid and the fact (GC) must equal half of (CD). 5. Since ( angle PLE_1 = angle ELP ) in an isosceles configuration, and due to the circle properties we get:     [     angle APC = angle ADC = angle ALG     ]     because angles opposite equal sides are equal in an isosceles trapezoid inscribed in a circle. 6. Considering pentagon (PAEGL) inscribed in a circle, sum of internal angles in trapezoid and their symmetrical properties provide:     [     angle ALR = angle ALE_1 - angle PLE_1 = angle ALP = angle AGP     ]     and thus:     [     angle E_1LF = angle AGC     ] 7. Therefore, the triangles (LE_1F) and (AGC) are congruent by angle-side-side congruency (or more technically ASA congruency if both angles and sides are checked to meet criteria). In conclusion, the sum of distances from the midpoint of the lateral sides to any point on the line (PL) meets the required properties of being minimal when considering the symmetry and properties of the isosceles trapezoid inscribed in a circle.

Hence, the answer is: boxed{(-infty, frac{3}{2})}. This problem primarily examines the important application of derivatives in determining the monotonicity of functions. The key to solving this problem is to first determine the equivalent condition for f(x) to be a decreasing function on the closed interval [-1, 1] using the idea of complements.

Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Initial Consideration:**    - Suppose we try to solve this problem using only 2 colors. If we color each row alternately with two colors, considering that there are 5 points per row, we would end up having 3 points of the same color in at least one row, violating the condition.

Let (M) be connected to the vertices (A), (B), and (C) by line segments (AM), (BM), and (CM) respectively.     We need to determine the maximum number of these segments ((AM), (BM), and (CM)) that can be equal to one of the sides of the triangle (ABC) ((AB), (BC), or (CA)). 2. **Exploration of Side Equalities**:     - Suppose (BM = AC) and (AB = MC).     - We need to check if the segments can form a valid geometric configuration. 3. **Use of Congruence**:     Analyze the congruence of triangles formed by these equal segments:         - Consider triangles (triangle ABM) and (triangle MCA).     - If (BM = AC) and (AB = MC), then triangles (triangle ABM) and (triangle MCA) are potentially congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) theorem:       [       triangle ABM cong triangle MCA quad text{(if all three pairs of corresponding sides are equal)}       ] 4. **Parallel Lines and Contradictions**:     Since (AB = MC), these triangles being congruent implies that the corresponding angles must be equal:     [     angle BAM = angle MAC quad text{and therefore} quad AB parallel MC     ]     Similarly, suppose another equality (AC = BM). This would imply:     [     angle CAM = angle MAB quad text{and therefore} quad AC parallel MB     ] 5. **Impossible Parallelogram Configuration**:     If (AB parallel MC) and (AC parallel MB), then quadrilateral (ABMC) would be a parallelogram.     - However, in a triangle, a point inside cannot make such configurations without violating the angles or length constraints. Specifically, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and the sum of the internal angles at (M) would invalidate the interior angle sum property of the triangle. 6. **Conclusion**:     By the analysis above, it is impossible to have more than one segment originating from the point (M) inside a triangle (ABC) equal to one of the sides of the triangle without it leading to contradictions in basic geometric properties or creating impossible configurations.     Therefore, the maximum number of such segments is only one.

Consider the set ( V = { 1, 2, ldots, 25 } ). We need to show that any subset of ( V ) with 17 or more elements contains at least two distinct numbers whose product is a perfect square. 2. First, note that a product of two numbers is a perfect square if and only if the product of their prime factorizations results in all even exponents. This means that the two numbers must share the same set of prime factors with even multiplicities. 3. Consider the set of perfect squares within ( V ): ( { 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 } ). These are the squares of ( { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 } ). Any subset of ( V ) with 17 or more elements must include at least one of these perfect squares because there are only 5 perfect squares and we are choosing 17 elements. 4. Next, consider the pairs of numbers whose product is a perfect square. For example, the pairs ( (3, 12), (2, 18), (4, 24), (5, 20), (2, 8) ) are such that the product of each pair is a perfect square:    - ( 3 times 12 = 36 = 6^2 )    - ( 2 times 18 = 36 = 6^2 )    - ( 4 times 24 = 96 = 4 times 24 = 16 times 6 = 4^2 times 6 )    - ( 5 times 20 = 100 = 10^2 )    - ( 2 times 8 = 16 = 4^2 ) 5. To avoid having a pair of numbers whose product is a perfect square, we must exclude at least one number from each of these pairs. There are 5 pairs listed, so we must exclude at least 5 numbers. 6. However, we are allowed to exclude only 8 numbers from the set ( V ) (since we are choosing 17 out of 25). This means we can exclude at most 8 numbers, but we need to exclude at least 5 numbers to avoid having a pair whose product is a perfect square. 7. Since we can exclude at most 8 numbers, and we need to exclude at least 5 numbers to avoid having a pair whose product is a perfect square, it is impossible to form a subset of 17 elements without having at least one pair whose product is a perfect square.

The main idea is to prove that for any (0 leq k leq f(n)), there are (n) consecutive integers containing exactly (k) prime numbers. 2. **Prime Distribution Function (F(n, l))**:    Define (F(n, l)) as the number of prime numbers in the closed interval ([l, n+l-1]). We make the following observations:        - If both (l) and (n+l) are primes or both are non-primes, then:      [      F(n, l+1) = F(n, l)      ]        - If (l) is prime and (n+l) is not a prime, then:      [      F(n, l+1) = F(n, l) - 1      ]        - If (l) is not a prime and (n+l) is a prime, then:      [      F(n, l+1) = F(n, l) + 1      ] 3. **Behavior Over Integers**:    Therefore, (F(n, l)) changes sequentially over integers (l in mathbb{N}).

[    BA_1 = A_1C + BC = AC + BC    ] 3. **Use of Symmetry**:    Consider the triangle ( ACA_1 ).

This is because the tangential plane at the contact point is common to both spheres, and the radii perpendicular to this plane intersect at the contact point. 2. **Configuration**:     - Label the centers of the spheres O_1, O_2, O_3, and O_4.     - Consider the plane through O_1, O_2, O_4. This plane intersects each of the three spheres g_1, g_2, and g_4 in circles, where these circles are great circles specifically when passing through O_4. 3. **Projections and Great Circles**:     - The plane cuts out three circles which intersect pairwise at points.

First Approach: 1. Reflect the non-parallel sides ( AD ) and ( BC ) across the perpendicular bisector of the parallel side ( CD ), forming isosceles trapezoids ( AA'C ) and ( B'BC ). 2. From the given isosceles trapezoids:    [    begin{aligned}    &AA' = AB - A'B = a - x,     &B'B = AB + B'A = a + x    end{aligned}    ] 3.

Applying the above on the triangles formed by the diagonals:     [     begin{aligned}     & e^2 = text{(sum of areas of corresponding rectangles)},      & f^2 = text{(sum of areas of corresponding rectangles)},      & b^2 = text{(sum of areas of corresponding rectangles)},      & d^2 = text{(sum of areas of corresponding rectangles)}     end{aligned}     ] 3.

Multiplying by (sqrt{(x+y)(y+z)(z+x)}), we get:    [ frac{sqrt{x+y} + sqrt{x+z}}{sqrt{y+z}} ]    is cyclically constant, implying (x = y = z). 5. **Evaluating at Critical Points:**    The minimum is achieved when (x = y = z = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). Substituting, we get:    [ (sqrt{frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} + sqrt{frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} + sqrt{frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}})^2 = (3 sqrt{frac{2}{sqrt{3}}})^2 = 6 sqrt{3}. ] Thus, the inequality holds.

Prove that the polynomial ( P(x) ) is linear.","output":"Given the polynomial function ( P(x) ) of integer coefficients and a positive integer ( n ), we define a sequence ( {a_k} ) such that ( a_0 = n ) and for all ( k ), ( a_k = P(a_{k-1}) ). It is known that for any positive integer ( b ), there exists an infinite number of terms in the sequence ( {a_k} ) that contain ( b ) as a factor with positive power. We need to prove that ( P(x) ) is a linear polynomial. 1. **Observation on the Sequence Property:**    - For any positive integer ( b ), the sequence ( {a_0, a_1, cdots} ) contains infinitely many terms having ( b ) as a factor greater than 1. 2. **Contradiction Assumption:**    - Assume, for contradiction, that ( P(x) ) is not linear, i.e., ( P(x) ) has a degree greater than 1. 3. **Difference Sequence Analysis:**    - Define ( d_k = a_{k+1} - a_k = P(a_k) - a_k ). Suppose ( a_{k+1} equiv a_k pmod{d_k} ).    - Since ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, if ( a equiv a' pmod{d_k} ), then ( P(a) equiv P(a') pmod{d_k} ). 4. **Modulo Property:**    - By induction, for any ( s ), ( a_{k+s+1} equiv a_{k+s} pmod{d_k} ).    - Therefore, ( a_{k+s} equiv a_k pmod{d_k} ). Denote this property as (1). 5. **Divisibility Condition:**    - ( d_k mid a_k(a_k - 1) ). 6. **Detailed Proof Using Prime Factorization:**    - Let ( p^l ) be a prime factor of ( d_k ). We need to show ( p^l mid a_k(a_k - 1) ).    - Let ( b = p^{l-1}(p-1)l ). Based on the analysis, there exists ( s > k ) such that ( a_s = m^b ) for some integer ( m ).    - Given (1), ( a_s equiv a_k pmod{p^l} ). 7. **Case Analysis Based on Prime Divisibility:**    - If ( p nmid m ), then by Euler's theorem ( a_s = (m^{p^{l-1}(p-1)})^l equiv 1^l equiv 1 pmod{p^l} ), implying ( a_k equiv 1 pmod{p^l} ).    - If ( p mid m ), then ( p^l mid a_s ), hence ( p^l mid a_k ). 8. **Combining Results:**    - Hence, ( p^l mid a_k(a_k - 1) ) as desired, indicating ( P(a_k) - a_k ) consistently divides the product ( a_k(a_k - 1) ). 9. **Conclusion:**    - From the above, for each ( k ), the product ( a_k(a_k - 1) ) can be entirely divided by ( d_k = P(a_k) - a_k ).    - Given the condition that the sequence ( {a_k} ) contains an infinite number of distinct integers, there must be infinitely many integers ( x ) such that ( |x(x-1)| geq |Q(x)| ), where ( Q(x) = P(x) - x ). 10. **Degree Analysis:**     - Assume ( P(x) ) has degree greater than 1. Then ( Q(x) ) would also have a similar or higher degree.     - The condition ( |x(x-1)| geqslant |Q(x)| ) would only hold if ( Q(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial with the leading coefficient ( pm 1 ), i.e., ( Q(x) = pm x^2 + ux + v ). 11. **Special Case Verification:**     - For ( Q(x) = pm x^2 + ux + v ), the condition ( Q(x) mp x(x-1) = (u pm 1)x + v ) would hold only if ( Q(x) = pm x(x-1) ), leading to ( P(x) = x^2 ) or ( P(x) = 1 - (x-1)^2 ). 12. **Contradiction to Infinite Divisibility:**     - For ( P(x) = x^2 ), the sequence ( a_k = n^{2k} ) would not satisfy the divisibility condition for every ( b ).     - For ( P(x) = 1 - (x-1)^2 ), ( P(x) leq 1 ) implying terms are not positive integers. 13. **Conclusion:**     - Since both cases lead to contradictions, we conclude ( P(x) ) must be a linear function.

Prove that all such points (P) lie on one straight line.","output":"1. **Angles involving X:**     Given that X is a point inside triangle ABC such that angle XAB = angle XBC = varphi, we start by expressing angle XAB in terms of angle B.      [     angle ABX = angle B - varphi     ]     Next, we find angle BXA by considering that the interior angles of triangle BXA must sum to 180^circ.     [     angle BXA = 180^circ - (varphi + (angle B - varphi)) = 180^circ - angle B     ]     Therefore, from these expressions, we see that for any point X with the given properties, the segment AB is subtended by the same angle, implying that all such points X lie on a fixed circle Omega that passes through vertices B and C. 2. **Introducing point Y:**     Let Y be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from O onto the line BP. Points X and Y are both situated on a circle omega with diameter OP. This comes from the fact that points on a circle subtended by a diameter form a right angle with the circle's diameter:     [     angle XOP = 90^circ     ] 3. **Relation of angles:**     Because angles drawn from a point on the circle to the endpoints of a diameter (OX and YP) are equal if the arc they subtend is the same, we have:     [     angle XYP = angle XOP = varphi     ] 4. **Conclusion of alignment:**     Since angle XYB = angle XYP = varphi = angle XAB, it follows that point Y lies on the same circle Omega passing through points A, B, and X. 5. **Perpendicular condition:**     Additionally, since angle OYB = 90^circ, point Y must be on another circle which has a diameter OB. Now, because Y is fixed by its construction, any point P constructed to be perpendicular to OX and to satisfy angle XOP = varphi must lie along a line passing through the fixed points B and Y. Conclusively, all such points P lie on the same line determined by B and Y.

Each of the next n rooms contains 2 people.      - All rooms with more than one person move one person to the next room.      - The first room (with 1000 - 2n people) will send one person to the next room.      - Each subsequent room (up to the n^text{th} room) sends one person to the next room.      - So, after 2n + 1 minutes:        - The first room contains 1000 - (2n + 1) people.        - Each of the next n rooms still contains 2 people.        - One additional room (the (n + 1)^text{th} room) contains exactly 1 person.      - Therefore, the hypothesis holds.    - **After 2n + 1 Minutes**:      - Now, assume the first room contains 1000 - (2n + 1) people.      - The next n rooms each have 2 people, and the (n + 1)^text{th} room contains 1 person.      - All rooms with more than one person (the first n rooms) move one person to the next room.      - Therefore, after 2n + 2 minutes:        - The first room contains 1000 - (2n + 2) people.        - The next n + 1 rooms each contain 2 people.        - Thus, the hypothesis holds for 2(n + 1) minutes. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Given the pattern holds for 0 leq n leq 499, after 60 minutes (n = 30):      - The first room will contain 1000 - 2 times 30 = 940 people.      - The next 30 rooms each will contain 2 people.      - Thus, in total, 30 + 1 = 31 different rooms will contain people.

Initially, J = C + 2 is a multiple of L = 1. As L = 1 today, J + n (where n = 0, 1, 2, ...) should be a multiple of 1 + n. Joey's age must thus satisfy C + 2 + n = k(1 + n) for some integer k and for 6 distinct values of n. 3. **Determine values fulfilling the condition**: Since J - 2 = C should be a multiple, need k(1+n) - 2 = k + kn - 2 for different n. This condition will hold when k = 1, then C + n must equal n-1. Thus, C = -1 does not form viable scenario inherently. Considering k greater, e.g., k = 2, solving C + 2 + n = 2n + 2 Rightarrow C = n. Since n = 0 gives C = 0, so C = 0 when n = 0. Testing for multiple n that give J = k(1+n) for 6 values of n, the next suitable number is k = 2 yielding C + 2 = 2(1+n) Rightarrow n = C. 4. **Find next multiple of Liam’s age using Chloe’s age**: Now we need C + m = m(1 + m) for some integer m. Setting up C = m + m^2. For C = 0, m^2 + m = 0 so m(m+1) = 0, giving m = 0 or m = -1 giving values of m = 0 which satisfy the criteria. The next multiple age moment for Chloe to suit this is C = 0 but will not translate to a valid case, thus needs reconsideration. 5. **Next valid solution**: For the next valid C, let's try C=10. This position m = 1 + m^2 Rightarrow 10 = 1 + m^2. Solving gives m = 3 or m = -3. When m = 3, Chloe will be 10 + 3 = 13 years. 6. **Sum the digits of Chloe’s age**: The sum of the digits of 13 is 1 + 3 = 4.

To determine if f(x) is even, odd, or neither, we test the function for -x.   We have f(-x)=frac{-x}{(-x)^2+1}.   Since (-x)^2=x^2, we simplify f(-x) to -frac{x}{x^2+1}.   Thus, f(-x)=-f(x), which proves that f(x) is an odd function.   Therefore, we conclude   boxed{text{f(x) is an odd function.}} **(2) Determine the monotonicity of the function f(x) on (1,+infty) and prove it using the definition:**   We want to show that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1,+infty).   Take x_1, x_2 in (1,+infty) with x_1 < x_2.   Consider the difference f(x_1) - f(x_2) = frac{x_1}{x_1^2+1} - frac{x_2}{x_2^2+1}.   Simplifying, we get f(x_1)-f(x_2) = frac{(x_1x_2-1)(x_2-x_1)}{(x_1^2+1)(x_2^2+1)}.   Since x_2 > x_1 > 1, it implies x_2 - x_1 > 0 and x_1x_2 - 1 > 0.   Therefore, the product (x_1x_2-1)(x_2-x_1) > 0, leading to f(x_1)-f(x_2) > 0, which means f(x_1) > f(x_2).   This proves that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1,+infty).   Hence, we conclude   boxed{text{f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1,+infty).}} **(3) Write down the range of the function f(x) directly:**   Given f(x)=frac{x}{x^2+1}, we directly state the range of the function f(x) without the need for further proof:   The range of f(x), considering the behavior of the function at various intervals and its limits at infinity, is   boxed{[-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}]}."},{"instruction":"There is one black box and n white boxes labeled 1, 2, cdots, n.

Based on the problem, such a cipher has at most 10000 characters. 2. **Definition of Partial Words**:     - Define a \\"partial word\\" as a sequence formed by some (but not all) of the initial letters of a word encoding a single letter.     - Since a single letter can be encoded by a word no longer than 10 characters, there are different partial words for each letter. 3. **Counting Partial Words**:     - There are 33 letters in the alphabet.     - The maximum length of words encoding a single letter is 10 characters, thus there are 10 - 1 = 9 possible partial word lengths (excluding 0 and the full length).            [     text{Total number of different partial words} = 9 cdot 33 = 297     ] 4. **Decoding with Position Markers**:     - When decoding, the positions where the cipher is segmented into words (each representing letters) determine the unique decoding.     - Assume two different encoded strings having such decodings that the segmentation points (position markers) do not match (one with markers in red, another with markers in blue). 5. **Handling Position Markers**:     - Consider each red position marker and look for the word formed between the current red marker and the nearest preceding blue marker (or the start of the encoded string if no blue marker exists).     - Such a segment will always form a \\"partial word\\" defined earlier.     - Since the number of original words in the cipher is at least 1001, the number of red segmentations will be at least 1000. According to textbf{Pigeonhole Principle}, there must be repetition since 1000 > 297 (more markers than different possible partial words). 6. **Eliminating Repeated Segments**:     - If two segments are found to be identical, the portion in between can be removed without changing the \\"ambiguous\\" nature but creating a shorter cipher.     - This contradicts the original assumption that we had the shortest ambiguous cipher, hence such a scenario cannot exist. # Conclusion: - The previous contradiction establishes that the initial assumption is false.

We will use proof by contradiction to show this. 1. Assume for the sake of contradiction that the polynomial ( f(x) ) can be factored into two non-constant integer polynomials, i.e., ( f(x) = g(x)h(x) ). 2. Let's take the prime number ( p ) such that    [    p > sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i|    ]     3.

Therefore, if ( f(x) ) has any root ( alpha ), it must satisfy:    [    left|alpha^k a_kright| geqslant left| sum_{k=1}^{n} alpha^k a_k right| = p > sum_{k=1}^{n} left|a_kright|    ]    Since ( p > sum_{k=1}^{n} |a_k| ), it indicates:    [    p > sum_{k=1}^{n} left|a_kright|    ] 6. As ( sum_{k=1}^{n} |alpha^k a_k| geqslant p ), we conclude:    [    |alpha| > 1    ] 7. This leads to a contradiction because we derived that ( g(x) ) has a root ( alpha ) with ( |alpha| leq 1 ), while also requiring ( |alpha| > 1 ) from ( f(x) ) having roots whose modulus exceeds 1. 8.

Consider the effect of each shuffle on the number of inversion pairs:    - Moving cards around within the stack affects at most two new inversion pairs.    - **Example**: Shuffle sequence from \\"cdots a, b cdots c, d cdots e, f\\" to \\"a, d, e, b, c, f\\".      - Removes: (a, b), (c, d), (e, f)      - Adds: (a, d), (e, b), (c, f)    - Adding 3 inversion pairs would be contradictory, as shown:      - Suppose a<b, c<d, e<f, but a>d, e>b, c>f, then contradiction arises: a < b < e < f < c < d < a! 5. In general shuffling operations:    - Each shuffle can **at most add 2 inversion pairs**; except for the first and the last shuffles which can only introduce 1 inversion pair. Conclusively: - To achieve exactly n-1 inversion pairs:   [ leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ]   operations are sufficient and necessary.    Thus, for the card sequence to be completely reversed: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1} ]"},{"instruction":"The function ( g(x) ) satisfies [ g(x  y) = g(x) g(y) ] for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), and ( g(x) neq 0 ) for all real numbers ( x ).

What is the maximum number of dwarfs for whom all the numbers they find could be different?","output":"1. **Define the Three-Digit Number:**    Let the three-digit number be denoted by (overline{xyz}), where (x) is the hundreds digit, (y) is the tens digit, and (z) is the units digit. Since it is a three-digit number, (x) and (z) must be non-zero: (x > 0) and (z > 0). 2. **Formulate the Condition:**    According to the problem, when 198 is added to this number, the digits of the resulting number must be the reverse of the original number. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:    [    100x + 10y + z + 198 = 100z + 10y + x    ] 3. **Rearrange and Simplify the Equation:**    To find the relationship between (x) and (z), rearrange the equation:    [    100x + 10y + z + 198 = 100z + 10y + x    ]    Eliminate (10y) from both sides:    [    100x + z + 198 = 100z + x    ]    Move all terms involving (x) and (z) to one side of the equation:    [    100x - x + z - 100z = -198    ]    Simplify:    [    99x - 99z = -198    ]    Divide through by 99:    [    x - z = -2    ]    Therefore, we have:    [    x = z - 2    ] 4. **Determine Valid Values for (x):**    Since (x) and (z) are each digits from 1 to 9, we need to find all valid pairs ((x, z)) that satisfy (x = z - 2):    [    1 le x le 9 quad text{and} quad 1 le z le 9    ]    Substituting (x = z - 2) and ensuring that both (x) and (z) fall within valid digit ranges, we get:    [    1 le z - 2 le 9     ]    Solving for (z):    [    3 le z le 9    ]    Hence, (z) can take any value from 3 to 9 (inclusive).  5. **Count Possible Values:**    For each valid (z) (i.e., 7 possible values: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), there is a corresponding value of (x), specifically (x = z - 2), yielding 7 different ((x, z)) pairs. However, (y) can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 possible values) and is independent of (x) and (z). 6. **Calculate the Total Number of Distinct Three-Digit Numbers:**    Therefore, the total number of distinct three-digit numbers satisfying the condition is:    [    7 times 10 = 70    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of gnomes such that each finds a unique valid three-digit number is: [ boxed{70} ]"},{"instruction":"Make an opentop water tank from a square sheet of iron with a side length of 120cm.

Setting y' = 0, we solve to find x = 80 (we discard x = 0). When x in (0, 80), y' > 0; when x in (80, 120), y' < 0, Therefore, x = 80 is the point of maximum value for the function y = -frac{1}{2}x^{3} + 60x^{2}, at which y = 128000 cm<sup>3</sup>.

We are looking for the rate (R). So, we can rewrite the formula as: 210 = (3000 × R × 1) / 100 Now, we can solve for R: 210 = (3000R) / 100 210 = 30R R = 210 / 30 R = 7 Therefore, the rate at which Moses invested is boxed{7%} ."},{"instruction":"Which of the following inequalities are correct?

We can use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of this expression.  First, we rewrite the expression as a sum of fractions and apply the AM-GM inequality: begin{align*} (a+1+b+2)left(frac{1}{a+1}+frac{1}{b+2}right) &= 1+frac{a+1}{b+2}+frac{b+2}{a+1}+1  &geq 2+2sqrt{frac{a+1}{b+2}cdotfrac{b+2}{a+1}}  &= 4. end{align*} Therefore, we have frac{1}{a+1}+frac{1}{b+2}geqfrac{4}{6}=frac{2}{3}. The equality holds when frac{a+1}{b+2}=frac{b+2}{a+1}, which simplifies to b=1 and a=2. Thus, option A is correct. For option B: We analyze the function y=sqrt{x^2+2}+frac{1}{sqrt{x^2+2}}. By applying the AM-GM inequality, we get: begin{align*} y &= sqrt{x^2+2}+frac{1}{sqrt{x^2+2}}  &geq 2sqrt{sqrt{x^2+2}cdotfrac{1}{sqrt{x^2+2}}}  &= 2. end{align*} The equality condition sqrt{x^2+2}=frac{1}{sqrt{x^2+2}} leads to x^2=-1, which is impossible since x is real. Therefore, option B is incorrect. For option C: Given x+y=2, we want to find the maximum value of xy. By the AM-GM inequality, we have: begin{align*} xy &leq left(frac{x+y}{2}right)^2  &= 1. end{align*} The equality holds when x=y=1. Thus, option C is correct. For option D: We analyze the inequality x^3+5x^2+4xgeq ax^2 for x>0. Dividing both sides by x^2, we get: begin{align*} frac{x^3+5x^2+4x}{x^2} &geq a  x+frac{4}{x}+5 &geq a. end{align*} Applying AM-GM to x+frac{4}{x}, we find: begin{align*} x+frac{4}{x}+5 &geq 2sqrt{xcdotfrac{4}{x}}+5  &= 9. end{align*} The equality holds when x=2.

Thus, (F) lies at point (B). 3. **Locating the other vertices**:    Since ( angle ABC = 108^circ ), which matches the internal angle of a regular pentagon, vertex (G) must lie on side (BC). 4. **Formation and intersection of parallel lines**:    Extend sides (EF) and (FG) and draw parallel lines through vertices (H) and (K). This process helps form the rhombus always starting from the initially inscribed pentagon. 5. **Symmetry and properties**:    Reflecting the configuration with the initial (72^circ) angle symmetry about bisector passing through (F), parallel sides and symmetry ensure that opposite sides remain equal and parallel, forming a rhombus. 6. **Utilizing similar triangles**:    Considering triangle (BCH) and recognizing that triangle (HCG) is similar because ( angle HGC = 72^circ = angle HCG ), we examine the proportions:    [    frac{HC}{BC} = frac{GC}{HC}    ] 7. **Establishing a relationship**:    From the similarity:    [    HC^2 = BC cdot GC    ]    Let (c) be the side length of the rhombus and (a) be the side length of the pentagon.

Given that 0.3 is a fraction between 0 and 1, and we are trying to find what power of 0.3 will give us 2, we should recognize that any base raised to an exponent to achieve a number larger than itself must have a negative exponent if the base is less than 1.

The probability of rolling a sum less than 5 is therefore the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes Probability = 6 / 36 Probability = 1 / 6 So, the probability of rolling a sum less than 5 with two dice is boxed{1/6} ."},{"instruction":"Consider a Modulo m graph paper where m=11.

Each worker can produce 2 units of product A or 1 unit of product B per day. Through testing, it is found that the profit for each unit of product A is 15 yuan, and for each unit of product B is 120 yuan. However, in actual production, producing product B requires additional expenses. After calculation, it is found that for each unit of product B produced, the average profit per unit decreases by 2 yuan. Let x be the number of workers assigned to produce product B each day. (1) Fill in the table according to the information: | Product Type | Number of Workers per Day | Daily Output (units) | Profit per Unit (yuan) | ||||| | A            | 65x                    | ______               | 15                   | | B            | x                       | x                  | ______                 | (2) If the profit from producing product A per day is 650 yuan more than the profit from producing product B, what is the total profit the company can make per day by producing products A and B? (3) According to market demand, the company needs to increase the production of product C without increasing the number of workers. It is required that the daily output of products A and C be equal. It is known that each worker can produce 1 unit of product C per day (each worker can only produce one unit of product per day), and the profit for each unit of product C is 30 yuan. To ensure that the company can make the same profit as in question (2) when producing three types of products per day, how many workers should be assigned to produce product A?","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Filling in the Table Given that x is the number of workers assigned to produce product B each day, the number of workers assigned to produce product A each day is 65 - x. Since each worker can produce 2 units of product A, the daily output for product A is 2(65-x) units. For product B, since each worker assigned to it produces 1 unit per day, the daily output is x units. The profit per unit for product A remains at 15 yuan. For product B, the profit per unit decreases by 2 yuan for each unit produced, making it 120 - 2x yuan per unit. Therefore, the completed table is: | Product Type | Number of Workers per Day | Daily Output (units) | Profit per Unit (yuan) | |--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------------| | A            | 65-x                    | 2(65-x)            | 15                   | | B            | x                       | x                  | 120-2x               |  Part 2: Total Profit Calculation Given that the profit from producing product A per day is 650 yuan more than the profit from producing product B, we set up the equation based on the profits: [15 times 2(65-x) - (120-2x) times x = 650] Simplifying: [1950 - 30x - 120x + 2x^2 = 650] [2x^2 - 150x + 1300 = 650] [2x^2 - 150x + 650 = 0] Dividing the entire equation by 2: [x^2 - 75x + 325 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x = 10 (valid solution) and x = 65 (not valid, discard). With x = 10, we calculate the total profit: [15 times 2(65-10) + (120-2 times 10) times 10 = 2650] Therefore, the total profit the company can make per day by producing products A and B is boxed{2650 text{ yuan}}.  Part 3: Adjusting for Product C Let m be the number of workers assigned to produce product A, meaning 2m units of product A are produced. Since the daily output of products A and C must be equal and each worker can produce 1 unit of product C per day, 2m workers are also assigned to produce product C. This leaves 65 - 3m workers to produce product B. The total profit equation becomes: [15 times 2m + 30 times 2m + [120-2(65-3m)](65-3m) = 2650] Simplifying: [60m + [120 - 130 + 6m](65 - 3m) = 2650] [60m + [-10 + 6m](65 - 3m) = 2650] Expanding and simplifying: [3m^2 - 85m + 550 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation, we find m = 10 (valid solution) and m = frac{55}{3} (not valid, discard).

Let's calculate the maximum number of queens that can be placed under this condition. 1. **Understanding the constraints**:    - Each queen can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.    - No two queens can attack each other except at most one pair. 2. **Maximum number per row/column**:    - We cannot place more than 2 queens per row or column because the third queen would be attacked by at least one of the other two.    - This means if we had 27 queens, we would need at least some row or column to have more than 2 queens. Let's explore this systematically. 3. **Proof by contradiction for an upper bound**:    - Suppose we attempt to place 27 queens.    - Since we can have up to 2 queens per row/column, having 27 queens implies that there are at least 7 rows (or columns) with more than one queen:      [      27 text{ queens} div 2 text{ queens per row/column} = 13.5      ]      rounding up to 14 rows/columns, as a half row/column doesn't make sense.    - Thus, if we place 27 queens, a minimum of 14 queens have to share their rows/columns with others.    - Consequently, we have:      [      27 - 14 = 13 text{ queens left to have their own individual rows/columns}.      ] 4. **Diagonal Considerations**:    - If some queens share the rows or columns, each queen must also avoid attacking others diagonally to fulfill the problem constraint.    - To ensure one queen was split between row, column, and diagonal conflicts – leading to more than one attack - a contradiction proves this placement invalid:      [      27 - 13 - 13 = 1 Rightarrow text{one queen attacks two others}      ] 5. **Practical construction (final configuration)**:    - From previous calculations and reasoning, the largest practical configuration provided numerous queens (23): Therefore, constructing or configuring the grid to place 23 queens such that no queen attacks more than one other queen follows feasible placement:   [ boxed{23} ]"},{"instruction":"A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks and 4 suits.

Analyzing orientation and ensuring we account for orientation preservation or restoring via even number of reflections: - No reflections: Only rotations. Every combination should ideally sum up to full circles (360^circ), which can be achieved seamlessly as these rotations are symmetric. - Two reflections: Equivalent to no reflection, reducing back to case of using only rotations.  Calculating combinations: - Pure rotations: They can be all 180^circ rotations, or combinations achieving 360^circ (like two 60^circ and one 240^circ, etc.). - Two reflections and one rotation (180^circ) will lead back to the original position as well.

Each unique pair of the 10 fillings is used exactly once:    [    binom{10}{2} = 45    ]    This is correct as we need all combinations of 2 fillings out of 10. 2. **Explanation of the trick details:**    - Vasya breaks ( n ) pies and learns their fillings.    - He must then identify at least one filling of any remaining pies without breaking them. 3. **Logical Deduction:**    - If Vasya breaks fewer than 36 pies, then more than 9 pies would remain. Assuming the worst case where the remaining pies each have different fillings.    - If fewer than 36 pies are broken, it implies at least 10 pies are left. In the worst case, these 10 pies could each lack one of the possible 10 fillings. 4. **Calculate minimum number of pies ( n ) required:**    - Consider ( n < 36 ):      - There would be at least 10 pies left unbroken.      - Since there are only 9 pies each containing a specific filling pair.      - Therefore, among the remaining pies, there is at least one pie that does not contain a specific filling.      - In this case, Vasya cannot guarantee knowing at least one filling in any remaining pie because he might pick a pie with a filling he hasn't seen yet. 5. **Verification when ( n = 36 ):**    - If Vasya breaks exactly 36 pies, 9 pies will remain.    - There are only 9 possible ways to have pairs of fillings (each filling appears in exactly 9 pies).    - By breaking 36 pies, Vasya can ensure that he has seen at least one of every filling type.    - This means that each of the 9 remaining pies must have a filling type that Vasya has already seen, hence he can confidently identify at least one filling in each remaining pie. # Conclusion: This ensures that ( n = 36 ) is the minimum number of pies Vasya needs to break in order for the trick to work.

We select (1, 2, 3). This provides simple combinations to begin covering numbers such as:       [       {1, 2, 3}       ]     - Adding another set to expand our possibilities, include the next set containing slightly larger jumps:       [       {0, 3, 6}       ]       This inclusion ensures that we reach sums involving 3 without redundancy and extend possible combinations.     - The third set should include an increment pattern ensuring we reach intermediate numbers:       [       {0, 9, 18}       ]       Here, the jumps are significant enough to cover necessary sums at intervals while combining with the previous sets.     - The fourth set extends the range further, ensuring larger jumps to complete the necessary number range up to 81:       [       {0, 27, 54}       ] 3. **Verification**     - Each integer from 1 to 81 should be possible to form by summing one element from each of the four chosen triples.     - Consider a few examples:       - The number (10):         [         1  (from  {1,2,3}) + 0  (from  {0,3,6}) + 9  (from  {0, 9, 18}) + 0  (from  {0, 27, 54}) = 10         ]       - The number (27):         [         3  (from  {1,2,3}) + 6  (from  {0,3,6}) + 18  (from  {0, 9, 18}) + 0  (from  {0, 27, 54}) = 27         ]       - The number (81):         [         3  (from  {1,2,3}) + 6  (from  {0,3,6}) + 18  (from  {0, 9, 18}) + 54  (from  {0, 27, 54}) = 81         ] By ensuring each integer from 1 to 81 can be represented by adding one element from each triple, the process demonstrates that we can achieve the desired sums comprehensively. **Conclusion:** The four triples of non-negative integers that satisfy the problem's requirement are: [ boxed{ begin{array}{c} {1, 2, 3},  {0, 3, 6},  {0, 9, 18},  {0, 27, 54} end{array} } ]"},{"instruction":"Given the ellipse C:dfrac{x^2}{a^2}+dfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1 left( a > b > 0 right), its eccentricity e=dfrac{sqrt{6}}{3}, and the sum of distances from a point on the ellipse to the two foci is 2sqrt{3}.

Then, b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 1. Hence, the standard equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1. 2. (Liberal Arts) Let N be the point (x, y). Then, M is the point (x, 0), and P is the point (x, frac{1}{2}y). Substitute these values into the standard equation of the ellipse: frac{x^2}{4} + frac{(frac{1}{2}y)^2}{1} = 1 Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = 4. Thus, the trajectory equation of point N is x^2 + y^2 = 4. 3. (Science) Let M be the midpoint of line segment PA with coordinates (x, y). If P has coordinates (x_0, y_0), then by the midpoint formula: x = frac{x_0 + 1}{2} and y = frac{y_0 + frac{1}{2}}{2}. Solving for x_0 and y_0, we get x_0 = 2x - 1 and y_0 = 2y - frac{1}{2}. Since P lies on the ellipse, substitute x_0 and y_0 into the standard equation of the ellipse: frac{(2x - 1)^2}{4} + (2y - frac{1}{2})^2 = 1.

Show that if  F  is a perfect family consisting of some subsets of a given finite set  U , then  leftlvert Frightrvertleleftlvert Urightrvert+1 . *Proposed by Michał Pilipczuk*","output":"We proceed by strong induction on the size of the set ( U ), denoted as ( |U| = u ). Assume all sets in ( F ) are non-empty and we aim to prove ( |F| leq |U| + 1 ). 1. **Base Case:**    For ( u = 1 ), the set ( U ) has only one element. Any subset of ( U ) can either be the empty set or the set itself. Thus, ( F ) can have at most 2 subsets: ( emptyset ) and ( U ). Therefore, ( |F| leq 2 = |U| + 1 ). The base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement holds for all sets ( U ) with ( |U| leq k ). We need to show it holds for ( |U| = k + 1 ).    Pick a random subset ( S subseteq U ) and suppose it has ( s ) elements. Divide the remaining sets in ( F ) into two groups:    - ( A ): All subsets of ( S ).    - ( B ): The remaining sets in ( F ).    Let ( C ) be the family of intersections of all sets in ( F ) with ( S ). 3. **Lemma 1:**    In ( C ), we cannot have two non-empty sets ( X ) and ( Y ) such that both ( (X setminus Y) ) and ( (Y setminus X) ) are non-empty.    **Proof:**    Consider sets ( G ) and ( D ) in ( F ) such that ( G cap S = X ) and ( D cap S = Y ). Apply the problem condition on ( G, D, S ). Since ( F ) is perfect, at least one of the sets ( (G setminus D) cap S ) or ( (D setminus G) cap S ) must be empty. This implies that one of ( (X setminus Y) ) or ( (Y setminus X) ) must be empty. Hence, ( X ) and ( Y ) are comparable, meaning one is a subset of the other.    This means that if we pick any two sets from ( C ), one is a subset of the other, which implies ( C ) has at most ( s ) elements. 4. **Lemma 2:**    We cannot have two sets in ( B ) such that they have the same elements that are not in ( S ) (non-zero number).    **Proof:**    Let their common non-( S ) set be ( H ) and their intersections with ( S ) be ( X ) and ( Y ). Without loss of generality, assume ( Y subseteq X ). Now, consider the sets ( X_1 = S ), ( X_2 = H cup Y ), and ( X_3 = H cup X ). Applying the problem condition, we see that one of the sets ( (X_1 setminus X_2) cap X_3 ) or ( (X_2 setminus X_1) cap X_3 ) must be empty. This implies that ( X ) and ( Y ) are comparable, meaning one is a subset of the other. 5. **Combining Lemmas:**    From these lemmas, we have that ( A ) has at most ( s ) elements and ( B ) contains at most ( u - s ) elements by the induction hypothesis on ( B ) (since no two sets in ( B ) have the same non-( S ) elements). Therefore, the total number of non-empty sets in ( F ) is at most ( s + (u - s) = u ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Since ( F ) can have at most ( u ) non-empty sets, and including the empty set, we have ( |F| leq u + 1 ).

The player who cannot make a move loses. Prove that the game ends in a finite number of moves. Who has a winning strategy?","output":"1. **Interpret the Problem in Binary System:**    Consider the sequence of coins where each coin facing heads up is denoted by 1 and each coin facing tails up is denoted by 0. Thus, any sequence of coins can be represented as a binary number. 2. **Example:**        For instance, a sequence represented as text{IFFIIF} (assuming I stands for tails and F stands for heads) can be translated into the binary number 011001_2 = 25_{10}. 3. **Reduction of the Binary Number:**    At each turn, the player selects a coin with heads up (a 1), flips it to tails (0), and flips all coins to its right. This operation effectively changes the bit from 1 to 0 and all subsequent bits are toggled. Here's why the binary number decreases strictly at each step:        - The bit selected (a 1) is changed to a 0, which reduces the value of the binary number.    - Toggling all subsequent bits swaps 1s to 0s and vice versa, but since the higher order bit (the one being flipped) is turning from 1 to 0, the overall value of the binary number decreases. 4. **Monotonic Sequence:**    Since every move results in a strictly decreasing binary number, starting from some positive integer, we get a sequence of strictly decreasing nonnegative integers. Thus, there is no infinite descending sequence, implying the game must end in a finite number of steps. 5. **Determining Winning Strategy:**        Let's address the strategy:        - **Initial Coin Configuration:**      - If the last coin is heads up (1), the initial player always has a move. Since the game's moves lead to a strictly decreasing binary number, the initial player keeps making moves until no further moves are possible, forcing the second player to lose. Thus, the initial player wins.      - If the last coin is tails up (0), similar logic applies to the second player, who will always have a move until no further moves can be made by the initial player. In this case, the second player wins. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore:    - If the last coin is heads up, the first player has a winning strategy.    - If the last coin is tails up, the second player has a winning strategy.

Similarly, ( M_B ) and ( M_C ) are the midpoints of ( BB' ) and ( CC' ).  3. **Perpendicular Bisectors and Circles**:    - The perpendicular bisector of ( AA' ) meets the line ( BC ) at ( X_A ).

By definition, ( A' ) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), and ( B' ) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ) and the angle bisector of ( angle ABC ).    - Since ( A' = B' ), this point must lie on both the perpendicular bisectors and the angle bisectors of ( triangle ABC ). This implies that ( A' ) is both the incenter and the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ).    - In any triangle, the incenter and circumcenter coincide if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

Since ( A' ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), it divides ( angle BAC ) into two equal parts, each of ( frac{1}{2} angle BAC ).    - The perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) is also the angle bisector of the external angle at ( A ) in ( triangle ABC ). Therefore, ( angle B'A'C' ) is the external angle at ( A' ) in ( triangle A'B'C' ).    - The external angle at ( A' ) is equal to ( 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAC ).    - Since ( angle B'A'C' ) is an external angle, it is supplementary to the internal angle at ( A' ), which is ( 90^circ ) (as ( A' ) lies on the perpendicular bisector).    - Therefore, ( angle B'A'C' = 180^circ - 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAC = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BAC ).

How many links will need to be opened?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints imposed by the ordering requirement and determine the maximum number of links that need to be opened to achieve the desired order. Here’s a step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:**    The jeweler made an open chain of N numbered links. The client demands a rearrangement that necessitates the opening of as many links as possible. We need to find out how many links the jeweler must open. 2. **Identify Pairs Needing an Adjust:**    Any pair of links that were originally neighbors but no longer neighbors in the new arrangement must have at least one link in the pair opened. Similarly, any two links that were not neighbors but need to become neighbors in the new arrangement also require opening at least one link in the pair. 3. **Group Strategy:**     We can break down the chain into smaller groups and rearrange them to maximize the number of links opened. One efficient way to do this is to use groups of 4 links since it balances complexity and the number of operations needed. 4. **Analysis with Example:**    Consider groups of 4 links each in an original order such as 1-2-3-4. In the new order, a possible arrangement might be 2-4-1-3. This change ensures that significant reordering is possible within a small subset of the total number of links. 5. **Generalizing to All Links:**    Suppose we divide the N links into groups of 4. Each group can be arranged in a new order that requires the jeweler to open links to break existing connections and form new ones. Each such rearrangement involves opening 3 out of every 4 links in the group.    Therefore, the number of groups is leftlfloor frac{N}{4} rightrfloor. In each group, 3 links need to be opened, leading to 3 cdot leftlfloor frac{N}{4} rightrfloor links being opened. 6. **Counting Remainder Links:**    Any remainder links (when N is not exactly divisible by 4) also need to be considered. If the remainder is 1, 2, or 3, it might result in extra links needing to be opened depending on the required rearrangement, but this does not significantly affect our calculation. 7. **Final Calculation:**    Therefore, the final number of links the jeweler must open is:    [    leftlfloor frac{3N}{4} rightrfloor.    ] # Conclusion: The jeweler must open at least: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{3N}{4} rightrfloor}  ] links to satisfy the client's demands."},{"instruction":"Find the largest constant C so that [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1 ge C(x + y + z)] for all real numbers x, y, and z.","output":"Given the inequality: [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1 ge C(x + y + z).] We aim to complete the squares for x, y, and z: [ left(x - frac{C}{2}right)^2 + left(y - frac{C}{2}right)^2 + left(z - frac{C}{2}right)^2 + 1 - frac{3C^2}{4} geq 0. ] For this inequality to hold for all x, y, and z, the constant term must be non-negative: [ 1 - frac{3C^2}{4} geq 0. ] [ frac{3C^2}{4} leq 1. ] [ 3C^2 leq 4. ] [ C^2 leq frac{4}{3}. ] [ C leq frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. ] Thus, the largest possible value of C is boxed{frac{2}{sqrt{3}}}."},{"instruction":"Let (a), (b), and (c) be real numbers greater than 1.

Solving frac{2}{3}f'(1) = 2 for f'(1), we find: [ f'(1) = 3 ] Substituting f'(x) = 2ax + frac{1}{x} at x = 1 and setting it equal to 3 gives us: [ 2a(1) + frac{1}{1} = 3 ] Simplifying, we find 2a + 1 = 3, which upon further simplification gives us the value of a as: [ a = 1 ] Now, substituting a = 1 back into the derivative formula f'(x) = 2ax + frac{1}{x}, we get: [ f'(x) = 2x + frac{1}{x} ] To find the slope of the tangent line at the point left(frac{1}{2}, fleft(frac{1}{2}right)right), we compute f'left(frac{1}{2}right): [ f'left(frac{1}{2}right) = 2 times frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 + 2 = 3 ] Therefore, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the given point is boxed{3}."},{"instruction":"Bully Vasya and Petya tore up the wall newspaper, with Petya tearing each piece into 5 parts and Vasya into 9 parts.

When Vasya rips each piece into 9 parts, the number of pieces increases by 8 each time (since (1) piece becomes (9), so (9-1=8)). 5. Each ripping action (by either Petya or Vasya) results in an even number of additional pieces of the newspaper (either (4) or (8)). 6. Since the initial number of pieces was (1), an odd number, adding an even number of pieces multiple times (any such combination of ripping actions by Petya or Vasya) will always result in an odd total number of pieces.    - Let's denote the number of pieces after some operations by ( N = 1 + text{(sum of even numbers)} ). 7.

When a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, each vertex of the polygon lies on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle (point O) is equidistant from all the vertices of the polygon. Since the polygon is regular, all its sides and angles are equal. The total angle around point O (the center of the circle) is 360 degrees. This total angle is divided equally among all the central angles formed by connecting the center of the circle to each pair of adjacent vertices. For a regular n-sided polygon, each central angle (angle formed by two radii and two adjacent vertices) would be 360/n degrees. In the case of a 20-sided polygon, each central angle would be 360/20 degrees. However, ∠OAB is not the central angle but an angle at the vertex of the polygon. To find ∠OAB, we need to consider the isosceles triangle formed by the radii OA and OB and the side AB of the polygon. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length, and thus triangle OAB is isosceles. The central angle O corresponding to the side AB of the polygon is bisected by the line segment AB, creating two equal angles at A and B. Since the central angle is 360/20 degrees, each of these angles at A and B (which are ∠OAB and ∠OBA) would be half of that. So, ∠OAB = (360/20) / 2 = 360/(2*20) = 360/40 = 9 degrees.

After n1 rounds of the game, the rabbit is located at point A_{n1}, and the hunter is located at point B_{n1}. In the nth round, the following events occur in sequence: 1. The rabbit moves invisibly to point A_n, such that the distance between points A_{n1} and A_n is exactly 1; 2. A locating device feeds back a point P_n to the hunter, and the device can only guarantee that the distance between point P_n and A_n is at most 1; 3. The hunter moves visibly to point B_n, such that the distance between points B_{n1} and B_n is exactly 1. The question is: Regardless of how the rabbit moves and regardless of the points fed back by the locating device, can the hunter always choose his movement in such a way that after 10^9 rounds, he can ensure that the distance between himself and the rabbit is at most 100?","output":"1. Let us denote the distance between the rabbit and the hunter at the end of the (n)-th round as (d_n = A_n B_n). 2. If for some (n leq 10^9), we already have (d_n geq 100), then the rabbit can maintain a distance of more than 100 from the hunter by moving in the opposite direction along the line connecting the rabbit and the hunter in each subsequent round.  3. Hence, let us assume (d_n < 100). 4. We need to show that regardless of the hunter's movement strategy, after 200 rounds, we always have the possibility that  [ d_{n+200}^2 geq d_n^2 + frac{1}{2}. ] 5. Suppose at the end of the (n)-th round, the rabbit is at (A = A_n) and the hunter is at (B = B_n). Let's further assume that the hunter knows the position (A) of the rabbit, thus rendering any previous information from the tracking device trivial. 6. Consider the following setup: draw the ray (BA) (if (B) and (A) coincide, draw a ray starting from (A)). Suppose the next 200 points reported by the tracking device are positioned every 1 unit along the direction of this ray starting from point (A), i.e.,  [ A_n P_{n+1} = P_{n+1}P_{n+2} = cdots = P_{n+199}P_{n+200} = 1. ] 7. Let (P = P_{n+200}). 8. Suppose the hunter is informed in advance of the subsequent 200 tracking points, i.e., (P_{n+1}, P_{n+2}, ldots, P_{n+200}). This will give the hunter more information to work with.   9. Clearly, the rabbit is within a circle (Gamma_1) centered at (P) with a radius of 1 unit. It is also within a circle (Gamma_2) centered at (A) with a radius of 200 units. Let (X) and (Y) be the points of intersection of (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2), as depicted in Figure 1. 10. Therefore, the rabbit could be at point (X) or (Y), and it may choose to hop from (A) either towards (X) or (Y). The distance covered in each jump is 1 unit. This distance complies with the game's rules. 11. Assume the hunter moves from (B) to point (C) along the line (BP_{n+200}), where (BC = 200). We can then express (d_{n+200}^2 = CX^2). 12. If the hunter adopts any other arbitrary strategy moving to point (Z) such that point (Z) lies to the left of (C), then position (Z) is either above or below line (BC). If point (Z) is above (BC), then (ZY^2 geq CY^2); if (Z) is below (BC), then (ZX^2 geq CX^2).  13. Ultimately, whichever path the hunter takes, we have (d_{n+200}^2 geq CX^2). 14. Now, let us compute (CX^2) using Stewart’s Theorem: [ begin{array}{l} CX^2 = frac{AX^2 cdot CP + PX^2 cdot AC}{AP} - AC cdot CP  = frac{(200)^2 cdot d_n + (1)^2 cdot (200 - d_n)}{200} - (200 - d_n) cdot d_n  = d_n^2 - frac{d_n}{200} + 1 geq d_n^2 + frac{1}{2}. end{array} ] 15. Initially, (d_n = 0). Therefore, after (n_0 = 4 times 10^6 + 200 < 10^9) rounds, it follows that (d_{n_0}^2 geq 10^4 + frac{1}{2}), implying that no strategy of the hunter can ensure (d_{n_0} leq 100). 16. Consequently, after (10^9) rounds, the hunter is unable to guarantee that the distance from the rabbit will be within 100 units. Hence, the conclusion: [boxed{text{The hunter cannot ensure the distance from the rabbit is within 100 units after } 10^9 text{ rounds.}}] square"},{"instruction":"William and Zach are playing a game, alternating turns throwing a ball at a can sitting on a fence.

In this case, we have a^2 = 1 and b^2 = frac{1}{4}, therefore, the eccentricity is: e = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} When m = -4, the equation changes to x^{2} - frac{y^{2}}{4} = 1, representing a hyperbola. For a hyperbola, the eccentricity e is calculated as e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}. Here, a^2 = 1 and -b^2 = frac{1}{4} (since b^2 is associated with the negative term in the hyperbola equation), thus we have: e = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{1}} = sqrt{2} = sqrt{5} In conclusion, the conic section x^{2} + frac{y^{2}}{m} = 1 has an eccentricity of: boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} text{ or } boxed{sqrt{5}}"},{"instruction":"Let a, b in mathbb{R}.

The total amount paid after n payments can be represented as a geometric series: Total amount = P1 + P2 + P3 + ... + Pn Total amount = P1 + 3*P1 + 3^2*P1 + ... + 3^(n-1)*P1 We know that the total amount Joan must pay back is 109300, and P1 is 100. So we can write the equation as: 109300 = 100 * (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^(n-1)) The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) where a is the first term of the series, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a = 100, r = 3, and the sum is 109300. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 109300 = 100 * (1 - 3^n) / (1 - 3) Solving for n: 109300 = 100 * (1 - 3^n) / (-2) 109300 * (-2) = 100 * (1 - 3^n) -218600 = 100 - 100 * 3^n -218700 = -100 * 3^n 2187 = 3^n Now we need to find the value of n for which 3^n equals 2187.

Due to the odd function property, f(-x) = -f(x), this increasing behavior reflects symmetrically about the origin. Therefore, in the interval left(-b,-aright), f(x) will also be increasing. This is because if f(x) increases as x increases in left(a,bright), then f(x) decreases as x decreases in left(-b,-aright), which, due to the odd function property, translates to an increase in f(x) as x increases in left(-b,-aright). Therefore, Option A is correct. **Option B: g(x) is increasing on the interval left(-b,-aright)** For an even function, such as g(x), if it is increasing in the interval left(a,bright), this does not necessarily imply it is increasing in left(-b,-aright). Because g(x) is even, g(-x) = g(x), meaning the function mirrors itself across the y-axis. If g(x) is increasing in left(a,bright), then in left(-b,-aright), g(x) will actually be decreasing, since g(-x) = g(x) and for x_1 < x_2 in left(-b,-aright), we would have g(x_1) = g(-x_1) > g(-x_2) = g(x_2). Hence, Option B is incorrect. **Option C: frac{f(x)}{g(x)} is odd and increasing on left(a,bright)** Taking the specific example of f(x) = x (odd) and g(x) = x^2 (even), where both functions are increasing on left(1,2right), we can test the behavior of frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = frac{x}{x^2} = frac{1}{x}, which is an odd function. However, frac{1}{x} is decreasing on left(1,2right) since as x increases, frac{1}{x} decreases. Therefore, Option C is incorrect. **Option D: f(x)+g(x) does not have odd or even symmetry, and the monotonicity on left(a,bright) is uncertain** Considering the function F(x) = f(x) - g(x), and analyzing its symmetry, F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = -f(x) - g(x) because f(x) is odd and g(x) is even. This shows that F(x) does not exhibit odd or even symmetry. Since f(x) is increasing on left(a,bright) and g(x) is also increasing on left(a,bright), it makes the monotonicity of F(x) = f(x) - g(x) uncertain on left(a,bright). Therefore, Option D is correct.

Let ( L ) be the point diametrically opposite ( M ) in this circle. Here ( angle LAM ) is right, so:    [    angle AMO = 90^circ - angle ALM    ]    Because ( AD perp BM ), we have:    [    angle BDA = angle BAD = 90^circ - angle ABM    ]    Since ( angle ABM ) and ( angle ALM ) subtend the same arc in the circumcircle of (triangle ABM), we get:    [    angle ABM = angle ALM    ]    Thus, proving:    [    angle BDA = angle AMO    ] 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**    We now aim to show A, D, M, and K' are concyclic. According to the theorem on cyclic quadrilaterals, this can be proven if either of the following conditions holds:    - (angle AMK' + angle ADK' = 180^circ)    - (angle AMG = angle AHF) for points ( E, F, G, H ) to be concyclic.    We consider the possible positions of M relative to AD.    **Case a.** (M) lies to the right of (AD), (O) and (K') are on the same side of (M):    - i. If B and (K') are on the same side of D, then:      [      angle AMK' = angle AMO = angle ADB = angle ADK'      ]      Hence, quadrilateral AMDK' is cyclic by condition 2.    - ii. If B and (K') are on opposite sides of D, then:      [      angle AMK' = angle AMO = angle ADB = 180^circ - angle ADK'      ]      So  angle AMK' + angle ADK' = 180^circ, making quadrilateral AMK'D cyclic by condition 1.    **Case b.** (M) lies to the left of (AD), (O) and (K') are on opposite sides of (M):    - i. If B and (K') are on the same side of D, then:      [      angle ADK' = angle ADB = angle AMO = 180^circ - angle AMK'      ]      Thus,  angle ADK' + angle AMK' = 180^circ, making quadrilateral ADK'M cyclic by condition 1.    - ii. If B and (K') are on opposite sides of D, then:      [      angle ADK' = 180^circ - angle ADB = 180^circ - angle AMO = angle AMK'      ]      Therefore, quadrilateral AK'DM is cyclic by condition 2. 5. **Conclusion:**    This confirms that points A, D, M, and (K') are concyclic. Since k is the unique circle passing through A, D, and M, it follows that (K' ) must lie on k, hence (K' = K). Consequently, (BK) is the same line, independent of the position of M on segment BC. This proves the desired result that (BK) is invariant for any choice of M on segment BC, as long as all constructions remain well-defined.

For Vasya to be following a winning strategy, ( c_k ):    [    c_k notequiv 0 pmod{n}    ]    Suppose ( c_k equiv 0 pmod{n} ), then the remaining stones ( a_k - c_k ) would be of the form:    [    r + nk - c_k = r + nleft(k - frac{c_k}{n}right)    ]    In this case, Petya can proceed by following Vasya's strategy for ( r + nleft(k - frac{c_k}{n}right) ) stones, contradicting Vasya's guaranteed win. Hence each ( c_k ) must be less than ( n ). 4. **Pigeonhole principle**: Since ( c_k ) are responses for ( n ) possible ( a_k ) values, and each ( c_k < n ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two indices ( k ) and ( l ) such that:    [    c_k = c_l text{ for } k neq l    ] 5. **Petya's strategy**: Assume Petya leaves ( a_l = r + nl ) stones by his first move. Vasya takes ( c_l ) stones in response. This results in:    [    a_l - c_l = r + nl - c_l    ]    Then, Petya can take ( n(l - k) ) stones, leaving exactly:    [    r + nk - c_l = a_k - c_k    ]    Thus, if Vasya had a winning strategy for ( a_k ) and ( c_k ), Petya can continue to follow Vasya's supposed winning strategy from this point, eventually taking the last stone, contradicting the initial assumption. 6. **Conclusion**: Since our assumption led to a contradiction, Vasya does not have a winning strategy, and Petya can always act to ensure he takes the last stone regardless of Vasya's actions.

Prove that with such movements, it is possible to move the hole to any other corner.","output":"1. **Labeling the Grid:**    We start by labeling the rows and columns of the rectangular grid formed by the box of dimensions (m times n), where both (m) and (n) are odd numbers. Let's assign coordinates ((i, j)) to the cell located at the intersection of the (i)-th row and (j)-th column, starting from (1) to (m) in the row and from (1) to (n) in the column. 2. **Definition of \\"Fields\\":**     Define \\"fields\\" to be the cells located at the intersections of rows and columns with odd indices. Notably, all four corner cells of our grid are \\"fields\\".  3. **Movement of the Hole:**     The hole initially placed in one of the corners is the starting point. When a domino piece adjacent to the hole moves to cover it, it exposes a new hole in a new position. 4. **Arrow Assignment:**     Assign an arrow from the center of each \\"field\\" (A) to the center of an adjacent \\"field\\" (B) if (A) and (B) are separated by a domino (assuming (A) is covered by a domino and (B) is the \\"field\\" exposed when this domino moves). Note: Due to the constraints, the hole remains within the set of \\"fields\\". 5. **Path Tracing:**     Construct arrows from each \\"field\\" (other than the initial hole) following the previous diagram. If a \\"field\\" (A) has an arrow pointing to another \\"field\\" (B), then the hole can move from (B) to (A) by sliding the domino along the direction of the arrow. 6. **Cycle Analysis:**     Consider the possibility of cycles (sequences of \\"fields\\" where movement can return to the same point). Given our domino arrangement and the properties of the grid (odd dimensions), any cycle formed will enclose a region with an odd number of cells—impossible in our configuration since each domino covers two cells, implying an even number of cells must be enclosed. 7. **Conclusion - Absence of Cycles:**     Since cycles in the paths are impossible (they contradict the even covering requirement and odd grid dimension), there will always be a path from any given \\"field\\" to the current position of the hole. This forms an acyclic connected structure allowing continuous movement of the hole through all odd-indexed cells. 8. **Final Proof:**     The non-existence of cycles guarantees that there is always a sequence of moves (defined through \\"fields\\" and arrows) to transfer the hole from its initial position to any other corner. As moving the hole involves sliding dominoes that respect the grid's odd structure, it reassures us that covering/uncovering operations maintain logical consistency. Given these steps and logical coherence, the problem is thus proven. The hole can indeed be moved to any corner of the box by following the paths predefined by the arrows and corresponding movements.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation is given by: Delta = (-2)^2 - 4(2a)(1) = 4 - 8a. For the discriminant to be positive: Delta > 0 Longrightarrow 4 - 8a > 0 Longrightarrow a < frac{1}{2}. But since we already have a > 0, combining these inequalities gives us: 0 < a < frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the range of a for which f(x) has two distinct extreme points is: a in left(0, frac{1}{2}right). To verify the solution, we have found that for a in the range (0,frac{1}{2}), the discriminant is positive, and a is greater than zero, satisfying the conditions for which the quadratic equation has two distinct positive roots. As such, the function f(x) has two different extreme points in this range of a.

(Walther Janous)","output":"1. **Determine Number of Quadratic Residues:**    We start by considering the set M consisting of frac{p^2 + 1}{2} quadratic residues modulo p. These are the numbers that can be written in the form a^2 bmod p for some integer a. 2. **Properties of Quadratic Residues modulo p:**    Since p is an odd prime, the quadratic residues modulo p belong to specific residue classes. It is known that the quadratic residues modulo p include 0 and exactly half of the non-zero residues. Therefore, the number of distinct quadratic residues modulo p is:    [    1 + frac{p - 1}{2} = frac{p + 1}{2}.    ]    This count includes the residue 0 and the rest being distinct residues modulo p. 3. **Distribution of Quadratic Residues:**        We distribute frac{p^2 + 1}{2} quadratic residues into frac{p + 1}{2} residue classes modulo p. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle (Schubfachprinzip):    [    leftlceil frac{frac{p^2 + 1}{2}}{frac{p + 1}{2}} rightrceil    ]    ensures that at least one residue class contains:    [    leftlceil frac{p^2 + 1}{p + 1} rightrceil    ]    numbers. 4. **Simplify the Expression:**    Simplify the fraction:    [    frac{p^2 + 1}{p + 1} = frac{p^2 + p + p - p + 1}{p + 1} = p + frac{p - 1}{p + 1}.    ]    Since 0 < frac{p - 1}{p + 1} < 1, we have:    [    leftlceil p + frac{p - 1}{p + 1} rightrceil = p.    ] 5. **Conclusion from the Pigeonhole Principle:**    At least one residue class has at least p quadratic residues. Select these p quadratic residues. Clearly, all these residues are congruent to the same value modulo p, making their sum divisible by p:    [    sum_{i=1}^p a_i equiv 0 pmod{p}.    ] 6. **Arithmetic Mean is an Integer:**        Since the sum of the selected p numbers is divisible by p, the arithmetic mean:    [    frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_p}{p}    ]    is an integer. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to select p elements from the set M such that their arithmetic mean is an integer.

For a **rectangle**: - Opposite sides are equal and parallel. - All angles are right angles, so opposite angles are equal. - Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. Comparing these properties, a rhombus and a rectangle share the properties of having equal opposite angles and parallel and equal opposite sides. They both also have diagonals that bisect each other.

It costs 1800 to paint the outside of a cube having each side of certain length. What is the length of each side of the cube?","output":"First, let's find out how many kilograms of paint were used to paint the cube if it cost 1800. Since the paint costs 60 per kilogram, we can divide the total cost by the cost per kilogram to find the number of kilograms used: 1800 / 60/kg = 30 kg Now we know that 30 kilograms of paint were used. Next, we need to find out how much area can be covered by 30 kilograms of paint. Since 1 kilogram of paint covers 20 square feet, 30 kilograms will cover: 30 kg * 20 sq ft/kg = 600 sq ft So, the total surface area of the cube that was painted is 600 square feet. A cube has 6 equal sides, so to find the area of one side, we divide the total surface area by 6: 600 sq ft / 6 = 100 sq ft per side The area of one side of the cube is 100 square feet. Since the area of a square (which is the shape of each side of the cube) is equal to the length of one side squared, we can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area: √100 sq ft = 10 ft Therefore, the length of each side of the cube is boxed{10}  feet."},{"instruction":"Solve the system of inequalities with respect to x: left{begin{array}{l}{frac{x1}{x+2}≤0}{{x}^{2}2x3＜0}end{array}right..","output":"To solve the system of inequalities with respect to x, we have the given system: left{begin{array}{l}{frac{x-1}{x+2}≤0}{{x}^{2}-2x-3＜0}end{array}right. 1. **Solving the first inequality** frac{x-1}{x+2}≤0:    - The critical points occur when the numerator x-1=0 or the denominator x+2=0.    - Solving these gives x=1 and x=-2, respectively.    - Testing intervals around these points, we find the solution for this inequality to be -2＜x≤1. 2. **Solving the second inequality** {x}^{2}-2x-3＜0:    - This quadratic inequality can be factored to (x+1)(x-3)<0.    - The critical points here are x=-1 and x=3.    - By testing values between these points, we determine the solution to this inequality is -1＜x＜3.

According to the circle theorem, if point ( C_1 ) lies on the circle with ( AB ) as the diameter, then the angle ( angle AC_1B ) is a right angle since the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle. 4. By this property, the length of the segment perpendicular to ( AB ) from point ( C_1 ) (the height) should satisfy the relation:    [    AD cdot BD = DC_1^2     ]     5.

It follows that {tma} < {(tm - 1)a} and {tmb} < {(tm - 1)b}, contradiction.     - If {tb} = 1 - epsilon > 1 - frac{ab}{mn} then {tmb} = 1 - mepsilon > 1 - frac{ab}{n} > 1 - b and {tma} = {tnb} > 1 - frac{ab}{m} > 1 - a.

WLOG m, n, k are all positive and k is minimal.     - Assume for the sake of contradiction k ge 2. Thus, either ma ge 1 or nb ge 1. WLOG nb ge 1, so it suffices to take {Xa} < a and {Xb} < frac{1}{n} < b. WLOG gcd(k, m, n) = 1. Let {Xa} = Z + epsilon, then I want Xk - Zm equiv 1 (bmod; n), which wins because {frac{X(k - ma)}{n}} = { frac{Xk}{n} - Xa frac{m}{n}} = { frac{Xk - (Z + epsilon)m}{n}}. But this is doable by density; (X, Xa (bmod; n)) are dense in mathbb{Z}_n times [0, n) so we can clearly take Xk equiv Zm + 1 (bmod; n) and {Xa} < epsilon for any epsilon > 0 (another way to think about it is that {frac{Xa}{n}} is dense in [0, 1), and fixing X mod n preserves the density). blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Jungkook has 5 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 3 yellow balls.

The domain of f(x) is mathbb{R}. 2. **Setting y=1 to find a recursive formula**:    - By setting y=1, we obtain f(x+1)+f(x-1)=f(x)f(1).    - Since f(1)=1, this simplifies to f(x+1)+f(x-1)=f(x).    - Rearranging, we get f(x+1)=f(x)-f(x-1). 3. **Finding the period of f(x)**:    - Using the recursive formula, we find that f(x+2)=f(x+1)-f(x) and f(x+3)=f(x+2)-f(x+1).    - This leads to f(x+3)=-f(x), implying that f(x+6)=-f(x+3)=f(x).    - Therefore, the period of f(x) is 6. 4. **Calculating specific values of f(x)**:    - Setting x=1 and y=0, we get f(1)+f(1)=f(1)f(0), which simplifies to 2=f(0), so f(0)=2.    - Using the recursive formula, we calculate:      - f(2)=f(1)-f(0)=-1,      - f(3)=f(2)-f(1)=-2,      - f(4)=f(3)-f(2)=-1,      - f(5)=f(4)-f(3)=1,      - f(6)=f(5)-f(4)=2. 5. **Summing up values of f(x) for k=1 to 6**:    - We find that sum_{k=1}^{6}f(k)=1-1-2-1+1+2=0. 6. **Extending the sum to k=1 to 22**:    - Since the period of f(x) is 6, the sum of f(k) for k=1 to 22 can be broken down into 3 periods of 6 plus the remaining terms.    - Thus, sum_{k=1}^{22}f(k)=3times0+f(19)+f(20)+f(21)+f(22).    - Given the periodicity, f(19)=f(1), f(20)=f(2), f(21)=f(3), and f(22)=f(4).    - Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{22}f(k)=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1-1-2-1=-3.

What is the smallest possible value of (N)?","output":"1. **Analyzing the problem:**    We need to find the smallest value of ( N ) for which we can place 13 points in an ( (N-1) times (N+1) ) rectangular grid such that the distance between any two points is greater than 2. 2. **Consider grid of size ( 6 times 8 ):**    To show that ( N le 7 ) is impossible, we begin with a grid of size ( 6 times 8 ) since this falls within the parameters ( (N-1) times (N+1) ) when ( N = 7 ). 3. **Breaking down the grid:**    We can divide the ( 6 times 8 ) grid into smaller ( 2 times 2 ) squares. This helps in analyzing the placement of points more systematically.  4. **Checking inside ( 2 times 2 ) squares:**    Inside each ( 2 times 2 ) square, the pairwise distances between cell centers are:    - ( sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2} approx 1.414 )    This distance is always less than 2. Therefore, each ( 2 times 2 ) square can have at most 1 point. 5. **Calculating maximum points possible in the grid:**    The ( 6 times 8 ) grid can be divided into:    [    left(frac{6}{2}right) times left(frac{8}{2}right) = 3 times 4 = 12 text{ squares}    ]    Since each square can contain at most 1 point, the total number of points in the ( 6 times 8 ) grid is 12, which is less than 13. 6. **Conclusion: ( N le 7 ) is not sufficient:**    Therefore, we cannot place 13 points in a grid of size ( (N-1) times (N+1) = 6 times 8 ). 7. **Considering a larger grid ( 7 times 9 ) when ( N = 8 ):**    Now checking if ( N = 8 ) allows for 13 points. Consider a ( 7 times 9 ) grid and place points such that no two points are within a distance of 2. 8. **Example placement in ( 7 times 9 ) grid:**    We find a placement strategy as follows:    [    begin{array}{ccccccccc}        &   &   & mathrm{X} &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &           & mathrm{X} &   &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &   &           &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &   &   &   &          mathrm{X} &   & mathrm{X} &   &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &           &   &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &   &   &           & mathrm{X} &   & mathrm{X} &   &   &   & mathrm{X} &       end{array}    ]    This placement ensures that all pairwise distances exceed 2. 9. **Conclusion: ( N = 8 ) works:**    We successfully placed 13 points in the ( 7 times 9 ) grid such that the distance between any two points is more than 2.

He notices that if he switches the two digits of his age (an integer), he gets Mary's age. Moreover, the difference between the squares of their ages is the square of an integer. How old are Mary and John?","output":"1. **Variables Definition**:    Let (10a + b) be John's age, where (a) and (b) are digits such that (0 leq a, b leq 9). Since we are swapping the digits, Mary's age is (10b + a). 2. **Given Condition**:    We know that the difference between the squares of their ages is the square of an integer. This can be written as:    [    (10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2 = k^2    ]    for some integer (k). 3. **Simplifying the Condition**:    Expanding both squares, we get:    [    (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2,    ]    [    (10b + a)^2 = 100b^2 + 20ab + a^2.    ]        Hence the difference is:    [    (10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2 = (100a^2 + 20ab + b^2) - (100b^2 + 20ab + a^2).    ]        Simplifying further, we get:    [    (10a + b)^2 - (10b + a)^2 = 100a^2 + b^2 - 100b^2 - a^2.    ]    [    = 99a^2 - 99b^2,    ]    [    = 99(a^2 - b^2).    ] 4. **Factoring the Difference of Squares**:    We know that:    [    a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b).    ]    Thus,    [    99(a^2 - b^2) = 99(a - b)(a + b).    ] 5. **Given that the Difference is the Square of an Integer**:    We set:    [    99(a - b)(a + b) = k^2,    ]    for some integer (k).  6. **Divisibility by 11**:    For (99(a - b)(a + b)) to be a perfect square, both (a+b) and (a-b) must satisfy certain conditions. Note that 99 can be factored as (9 times 11). Thus one of the factors, (a + b) or (a - b), must be divisible by 11. 7. **Finding Suitable Digits**:    Since (0 leq a, b leq 9) and (a > b), the only possibility for (a + b = 11). This is because 11 is the only number between 0 and 18 that makes (a + b) divisible by 11.

Since (AB = BC) and (AD = CD), triangles (ABD) and (CBD) are constructed with equal segments such that the diagonal segments (B rightarrow D) and the midpoint calculations around triangle (BDC). 2. Given that (MC = 6), and (MC) forms an altitude in the right triangle (BCD), we relate (MC) to the segments (MB) and (MD):    [    MB cdot MD = MC^2 = 6^2 = 36.    ] Conclusion: 1.

Let's denote the number of large rooms as L and the number of small rooms as S. Each large room can accommodate 3 people, and each small room can accommodate 2 people. We have a total of 26 people to accommodate. The total number of people accommodated can be represented by the equation: 3L + 2S = 26 We want to maximize L (the number of large rooms) while ensuring that S (the number of small rooms) is a non-negative integer because we can't have a fraction of a room. Let's start by seeing how many large rooms we can use: If we use 8 large rooms, we would accommodate 24 people (because 8 * 3 = 24), leaving 2 people to be accommodated in a small room. So, we would need 1 small room. This would give us: 3 * 8 + 2 * 1 = 24 + 2 = 26 So, we can accommodate all 26 people using 8 large rooms and 1 small room.

Therefore, if we let ( E ) be the total number of edges of the polyhedron, we get:    [    sum_{k} k cdot p_k = 2E    ] 4. **Contribution of Different Vertex Degress:**    Considering vertex degrees, we can express the sum more explicitly as:    [    sum_{k} k cdot p_k = 3p_3 + 4p_4 + 5p_5 + cdots    ] 5. **Total Number of Edges:**    Summing the previous expression gives us:    [    2E = 3p_3 + 4p_4 + 5p_5 + cdots    ] 6. **Translation to Total Face Contribution:**    To find ( a ), we consider ( a ) as the total number of edges ( E ), divided by 2 because each edge is counted at two vertices:    [    a = E    ] 7. **Equating ( 2a ) to Vertex Contributions:**    Therefore, substituting back, we get:    [    2a = 2E    ]    And since we derived that:    [    2E = 3p_3 + 4p_4 + 5p_5 + cdots    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    We conclude that:    [    2a = 3p_3 + 4p_4 + 5p_5 + cdots    ] Thus, the proof is complete, and the equality has been demonstrated as required.

Let's analyze the conditions step by step: 1. **Divisibility by 2:**     - A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is an even number.     - The possible choices for the last digit are 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. This gives us 5 different possibilities. 2. **Divisibility by 9:**     - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.     - The sum of the given digits 2, 0, 1, 6, 0 is 9.     - Let's denote the five digits to replace the asterisks as d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, and d_5.

Using all possible residues:     - Since digits d_1, d_2, d_3 can each be any digit independently, they cover all possible remainders 0 through 8.     - We handle the remaining sum modulo 9 by choosing d_4 such that it compensates for the choice of d_1, d_2, and d_3, ensuring the final sum modulo 9 is congruent to 0.     After choosing d_1, d_2, d_3 and ensuring the desired sum with d_4, we have guaranteed an appropriate d_5.

The problem gives us two scenarios: 1. If each person contributes 5 coins, they are short of 45 coins. 2. If each person contributes 7 coins, they are short of 3 coins. From these scenarios, we can set up equations based on the total amount of money needed to buy the sheep. In the first scenario, the total amount of money collected plus the shortfall equals the total cost of the sheep. In the second scenario, the same logic applies. This gives us two equations: 1. 5x + 45 equals the total cost of the sheep. 2. 7x + 3 also equals the total cost of the sheep. Since both expressions equal the total cost of the sheep, we can set them equal to each other to find the number of people in the group.

So, the coefficient for 4^3 is 2. Now, subtract 128 from 157 to get a remainder of 29. Then, the largest multiple of 16 that fits into 29 is 1 cdot 16 = 16, and the coefficient for 4^2 is 1. This leaves a remainder of 29 - 16 = 13. For 4^1 = 4, the largest multiple fitting into 13 is 3 cdot 4 = 12. The coefficient for 4^1 is 3. Finally, the remainder is 13 - 12 = 1.

This implies that g(x+1) = e^{x+1} = e cdot e^x = e^x, which is consistent with the definition of an extended function. Therefore, g(x) can be considered a periodic function with a period of 1 within the context of the problem, and its range within the interval (0,1) is (1,e). For statement (1), we analyze the intersection points between y = kx + b and y = g(x) = e^x. Since g(x) is not truly periodic across all real numbers but is defined piecewise with the property of an extended function, and its range is (1,e), a line y = kx + b (with k neq 0) cannot intersect g(x) infinitely many times because the slope k and the range of g(x) limit the number of possible intersections. Therefore, statement (1) is incorrect. **For h(x) = x^{10} when x in (0,1):** Given that h(x+1) = h'(x), we find h'(x) = 10x^9. However, the key insight here is not the derivative itself but the fact that for a specific value of k, specifically k = 10!, there can be a unique scenario where y = kx + b overlaps with y = x^{10} over an interval, leading to infinitely many intersection points due to the extension property of h(x). For statement (2), when k = 10!, we can adjust b such that y = 10!x + b aligns with y = x^{10} over a certain interval, like (9,10). This alignment, considering the extension property and the behavior of h(x), results in infinitely many intersection points between the line and the function within the extended definition.

This is because knights and liars would give different responses to the same question. 2. **Responses Analysis**:    - More likely, the answers will vary since there are both liars and knights.    - In this case, neighboring individuals will have given differing responses. We then investigate the interval (arc) between those who gave different responses. 3. **Intermediate Placement**:    - The traveler then stands in the middle of this arc (which is between one knave and one knight).    - He repeats the question at this new position. 4. **Response Consistency**:    - Since at least one of the individuals is a liar, the distance to the nearest liar from either position is known.    - Knights will truthfully provide this distance, while liars will give incorrect distances. 5. **Identification of Liars and Knights**:    - Based on the mentioned distances, those revealing the correct distance are knights.    - All remaining ones who provide incorrect information are liars.

If the conclusion of the problem does not hold, for any vertex (X), it either:    - Is connected by an edge to 4 other vertices (known people), and     - Those 4 vertices ((A, B, C, D)) each must connect to 3 more vertices since (X) is already one of their 4 connections. This suggests that these vertices (A, B, C, D) connect with the rest of the graph behind the original connections of (X). 4. Hence, these 4 vertices each account for additional 12 connections, but we haven't connected any vertex more than once (i.e., beyond 4 connections for each of (A, B, C, D)). 5. Since we have 34 edges in total and we used ( 4 times 3 + 4 = 16 ) for the immediate 4 vertices discussing connections around vertex (X), this means we need to connect the rest freely. 6.

Any line that defines a side of the smaller polygons passes through two vertices of the original n-gon. 4. Each vertex of the original n-gon can be a part of at most two such lines:    - Because each vertex can be a part of one of the original n-gon's sides.    - And can be part of at most one of the diagonals forming the subdivided polygons. 5.

Let's denote vertices of the original n-gon as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. 4. Suppose diagonals A_1A_p and A_1A_q forming the sides of the new polygon originate from vertex A_1. For any vertex A_1 to turn the new polygon to have n sides:    - Both A_p and A_q must be neighboring vertices (since diagonals must connect vertices without splitting the boundary's interiors).    - This implies that vertices A_p and A_q are adjacent, thereby not adding any new vertex within.    - Generally, resulting in q = p + 1. 5. This must hold for every vertex in the original polygon for it to construct a new subdivided polygon having n sides. 6. If every vertex in the original n-gon follows this pattern, no additional vertex diagonals would split the resulting internal smaller polygons into having fewer sides. 7. However, this specific scenario leaves us with the realization that subdividing any original vertex’s diagonals ensures at most n-1 across newly formed polygons.

We denote a_n as the probability of the bug being at vertex A after crawling n meters. Specifically, this is defined as the probability that the bug returns to point A after n meters of crawling. 2. If the bug has crawled n-1 meters and is not at vertex A, the probability of this happening is (1 - a_{n-1}). From any point other than A, the probability of moving towards A on the next crawl is (frac{1}{3}) since each vertex (other than A) has three edges. 3.

Express vector ( overrightarrow{AN'} = overrightarrow{n'} ) 2. Prove that (left(BCN'right) = frac{| vec{c} |}{|vec{b}|}) # Steps: 1. **Consider the vector form of the bisector properties:**    According to the properties of the angle bisectors in vector form:    - The internal bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent side lengths.    - Similarly, the external bisector divides the opposite side into a ratio of the same lengths but with opposite vector directions.     2. **Express the vector through given (vec{b}) and (vec{c}):**    We know:    [    overrightarrow{AN'} = k vec{c} + m (vec{b})     ]    Since (N') is on (BC), it lies on the line segment (BC). Therefore, any vector from (A) to (N') can be expressed as:        [    overrightarrow{AN'} = lambda overrightarrow{AB} + (1-lambda) overrightarrow{AC}    ] 3. **Apply external bisector theorem:**    The external bisector theorem states that for an angle bisector of exterior angle at (A), the point (N') divides (BC) such that:    [    frac{BN'}{CN'} = -frac{AB}{AC} = -frac{|vec{c}|}{|vec{b}|}    ] 4. **Setting up the proportions:**    Given ( overrightarrow{AB} = vec{c} ) and ( overrightarrow{AC} = vec{b} ),    we replace the segments with corresponding vectors:    [    N' = frac{- vec{c} cdot vec{BC} + b cdot vec{BC}}{b - c}    ] 5. **Deriving (overrightarrow{n'}):**    Use:    [    overrightarrow{n'} = frac{overrightarrow{BC} cdot vec{c} - c vec{b}}{|vec{b}| - |vec{c}|}    ]        Thus, the vector for ( overrightarrow{n'} ) becomes:    [    overrightarrow{n'} = frac{vec{b} cdot -vec{c} + vec{b} cdot |vec{b}|}{|vec{b}| + |vec{c}|}    ] 6. **Verification:**    Verify the derived result of the ratio:    [    left(BCN' right) = frac{| vec{c} |}{|vec{b}|}    ]    Using the derived proportion paths and calculating, we get the defined ratio.

James earns 2 points for each correct answer, so for 24 correct answers, he earns 24 times 2 = 48 points. 3. Then, we determine the bonus points. James missed one question, which means he only missed the bonus for one round. Since there are 5 rounds, and he missed the bonus in one, he gets the bonus for 5 - 1 = 4 rounds. Each bonus is worth 4 points, so the total bonus points are 4 times 4 = 16 points. 4. Finally, we add the points from correct answers and the bonus points to find the total points James scored.

Therefore, the point ((x_0, y_0)) lies on both graphs of ( y = f(x) ) and ( x = f(y) ). 3. Conversely, if a point ((x_0, y_0)) lies at the intersection of these graphs, then it satisfies both equations ( y_0 = f(x_0) ) and ( x_0 = f(y_0) ).

This variability in their potential relationship means that we cannot conclusively say m is parallel to n.    **Conclusion for A:** Incorrect **For Option B:**   If m is parallel to alpha and n is a subset of alpha, then it's clear m does not lie on alpha by the definition of parallelism. The line n, being a subset of alpha, lies entirely within the plane.
