This condition is always true, indicating that a can be any real number based on this condition alone. 2. **For x in (0,3]:** The inequality x^{2}+(a-4)x+4 > 0 must hold for all x in this interval. This implies that the expression on the left must be positive for all x in this range. 3. **Analyzing the inequality a > -x-frac{4}{x}+4:** This inequality is derived from rearranging the original inequality to solve for a. We need to find the minimum value of the expression on the right to ensure the inequality holds for all x in (0,3]. 4. **Using AM-GM inequality:** The expression -x-frac{4}{x}+4 can be rewritten and analyzed using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality. Specifically, -x-frac{4}{x}+4 leq -2sqrt{xcdotfrac{4}{x}}+4 = 0, where the equality holds when x=2. This means the minimum value of the expression on the right is 0 when x=2. 5. **Conclusion for a:** Since the minimum value of -x-frac{4}{x}+4 is 0, for the original inequality to always hold, we must have a > 0.

We use the notation where:     - Unmarked letters represent just red points.     - The same letters with a prime (e.g., (L')) represent pairs involving diametrically opposite (blue) points.     - The notation (|AB|) stands for the length of the shorter arc between points (A) and (B). 3. **Consider the circumference divided into arcs of natural lengths from 1 to 100.**          - Define (s) as half the circumference, which is an integer (since the total length is even). 4. **Define a simple arc:**         An arc without any internal red points is referred to as a simple arc. 5. **Breakdown of arcs and their properties:**     - Consider an overall arc of length (s - k), where (1 leq k leq 100).     - This arc is composed of simple arcs, including two extremes adjacent to the ends of this arc.      - Demonstrate that if the lengths of these extreme arcs are not equal to (k), the required perpendicular chords can be found. 6. **Detailed step-by-step verification:**     - A simple arc of length (k) cannot align directly with the length on the outside. Otherwise, it would merge into a semicircle, implying the presence of diametrically opposite red points, which conflicts with the assumption.     - Consequently, there must be four different points marking the ends of the arcs.        7. **Evaluate possible configurations:**     i. **Case 1:**                  - If the simple arc lies outside the longer arc, examine the two intersecting chords from the ends of the long arc to the ends of the simple arc.         - The angle between these chords can be measured by the half-sum of the angular measures of the arcs, leading to a right angle, thereby demonstrating perpendicularity.     ii. **Case 2:**                  - Partly, show there exists a long arc not forming the extreme, simple arc.         - Name an arc of length (s - k), (1 leq k leq 50).         - For any point (A), choose a segment with one end at (A).         - If (A') lies on a simple arc, break it into two parts (|A B| = s - k). Here, (|A'B| leq |A'C|).         - Hence, we identify at least 50 such arcs by selection.          8. **Prove that among the selected arcs, two have equal lengths:**           - If no such arc of length (s - k) exists, lengths shorter than the arcs must coincide by the pigeonhole principle.     - If an arc of length (s - 50) exist implies two arcs of the length (s-50), leading to two non-intersecting long arcs perpendicular at least one containing a simple length (2k) arc set between (D) and (F), and (E) meets at particular arcs for non-intersect segments.

To determine where f'(x) is negative, which indicates a decreasing interval, we analyze the sign of the numerator and denominator separately. The denominator (ln x)^2 is always positive for x > 0 (since ln x is real when x > 0 and squaring ensures positivity). Let's consider the numerator ln x - 1. It will be negative when ln x < 1, which occurs when 0 < x < e. Thus, f'(x) < 0 on (0, e), excluding the point x = 1 itself as ln 1 = 0 would cause division by zero. Hence, we partition the interval into two, accounting for the exclusion: 1. On the interval (0, 1), ln x < 0, hence ln x - 1 < 0, and since (ln x)^2 > 0, f'(x) < 0, and the function is decreasing. 2. On the interval (1, e), 0 < ln x < 1, hence ln x - 1 < 0, and since (ln x)^2 > 0, f'(x) < 0, and the function is decreasing. Therefore, the function is monotonically decreasing on (0, 1) and (1, e).

This is because the axis of symmetry is exactly in the middle of a and 4-a, which gives us: [x = frac{a + (4 - a)}{2} = 2.] 2. **Direction of the Parabola:** Given the equation y=-5x^{2}+px+q, the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-5), indicating that the parabola opens downwards. 3. **Comparing y_{1} and y_{3}:** Since the parabola is symmetric about x=2, and points B(0,y_{1}) and E(4,y_{3}) are equidistant from the axis of symmetry, they have the same y-value.

Therefore, f(x)={log_2}({sqrt{{x^2}+1}-x}) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0].

This center (O) is the intersection point of the diagonals (AC) and (BD).  3. **Proportions and Relationship:**    Since (AP = CQ) and (P) and (Q) are on the same diagonal (AC), it can be deduced that the segments on the diagonal (AC) are symmetric about the center (O), meaning (P) is equidistant from (A) as (Q) is from (C).  4. **Parallel Lines:**    Given that (PM parallel AD) and (QM parallel AB), these parallel lines imply corresponding proportions along the segments they are parallel to. This setup ensures that the triangle (ABM) is similar to (PAM), maintaining the proportionality. 5. **Intersection with Diagonal (BD):**    Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, (O) is the midpoint of both (AC) and (BD).

We are given that together they take 8.571428571428571 days to complete the work, which means their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ). So we can set up the equation: [ frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{20} = frac{1}{8.571428571428571} ] To solve for ( x ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation, which is ( 20x ).

Since c is the largest side, its maximum value can be n, i.e., c leq n. 3. **Step 3:** For each possible value of c, we need to find the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that a leq b leq c and a + b > c (triangle inequality condition).  4. **Step 4:** Sub-cases based on the parity of c (even or odd).          - **Case 1:** c is even       [       c = 2k       ]       The possible values for b are from frac{c}{2} + 1 to c:       [       b = k + 1, k + 2, ldots, 2k       ]       For each possible value of b, a can range from 1 to c - b + 1.

She will stop when the second basket contains 13 apples. In which of the other two baskets, the first or the third, will there be more apples? Provide a justification for the answer.","output":"1. Let's first observe the sequence in which Dasha puts the apples into the baskets. The order is as follows:      First basket, Second basket, Third basket, Second basket, First basket, Second basket, Third basket, Second basket, and so on. 2. Let's break down this process into pairs of actions for simplicity and comprehension:     - Dasha puts an apple in the first and second baskets.     - Then, Dasha puts an apple in the third and second baskets. 3. This process forms a repetitive cycle of 4 steps, which can be summarized as:     1. First -> Second     2. Third -> Second     3. First -> Second     4. Third -> Second 4. Notice that every pair of steps involves placing an apple into the second basket. Hence, for  each cycle of 4 steps, two apples are placed into the second basket. 5. To have exactly 13 apples in the second basket, we can determine how many complete cycles are performed. Since each cycle places 2 apples in the second basket:     [     text{Number of complete cycles} = frac{13}{2} = 6 text{ cycles.}     ]     This leaves us with (1) additional apple to place. Therefore, 13 apples occur at the (6) complete cycles with one more apple placed in the second basket from the first step of the following cycle. 6. Now, let’s determine how many apples would be in the first and third baskets after these cycles considering the actions within each cycle:    - Within one cycle (4 steps), the first basket receives apples twice (steps 1 and 3).    - The same cycle places apples in the third basket also twice (steps 2 and 4). 7. Given (6) complete cycles plus (1) additional first step (from the 7th cycle), the count for each basket is:     - First basket:          [         2 text{ (each cycle)} times 6 text { (cycles)} + 1  text{ (7th cycle first step)} = 12 + 1 = 13.         ]     - Third basket:         [         2 text{ (each cycle)} times 6 text { (cycles)} = 12.         ] 8.

FG parallel CD, so triangles AFG and ABD are similar. Since EF=FC=frac{4}{3}, BF = BE + EF = frac{8}{3}, and BG = BC - FC = frac{8}{3}. Using similarity, the ratio of corresponding sides is:    [    frac{AF}{AB} = frac{FG}{BD} = frac{frac{4}{3}}{8} = frac{1}{6}    ] 3. **Using mass points to find BP:PQ:**    Assign a mass of 1 to B and C. Since BE = EF = FC, masses at E and F equal 1. The total mass at B and C are 1. Hence, E's mass is 2 (balancing B and F). The mass at A (balancing B and D using rectangle properties) equals 2. Thus, at P (balancing A and E), the total mass is 4. The ratio BP:PQ is therefore inversely proportional to these masses, giving us 2:4 = 1:2 for balanced parts between B and F through P. 4. **Calculate DQ:QB using the symmetry of diagonals in rectangle:**    BD diagonally halves the rectangle making triangle ABD similar to triangle CDB, hence DQ = QB = BD/2. 5. **Combine the ratios to find BP:PQ:QD:**    Resulting from midpoint theorem, the entire segment BD splits through P and Q yielding BP = frac{4}{9}; PQ = frac{1}{9} (mid-segment in frac{BQ}{2} due to equal partition); QD = frac{4}{9}. Therefore, the ratio BP:PQ:QD = 4:1:4.

Using the identity ( sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1 ), we find sin A:    [    sin^2 A = 1 - left(frac{4 - 3a^2}{2bc}right)^2    ]    [    sin A = sqrt{1 - left(frac{4 - 3a^2}{2bc}right)^2}    ] 4. The area S of the triangle can be expressed using the sine rule:    [    S = frac{1}{2} bc sin A    ]    Thus,    [    4S^2 = b^2 c^2 sin^2 A    ]    Substituting sin^2 A:    [    4S^2 = b^2 c^2 left[1 - left(frac{4 - 3a^2}{2bc}right)^2right]    ]    [    4S^2 = b^2 c^2 - left(2 - frac{3a^2}{2}right)^2    ] 5. To maximize the area, we need to find the maximum value of 4S^2. By simplifying the expression above, compare it with:    [    left(frac{b^2 + c^2}{2}right)^2 - left(2 - frac{3a^2}{2}right)^2    ]    [    4S^2 leq left(2 - a^2 right)^2 - left(2 - frac{3a^2}{2}right)^2    ]    [    = -frac{5}{4}left(a^2 - frac{4}{5}right)^2 + frac{4}{5}    ] 6. Maximizing the above expression gives:    [    frac{4}{5}    ]    Thus,    [    S leq sqrt{ frac{4}{20} } = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}    ] 7. The maximum area is achieved when a = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, b = c = frac{sqrt{30}}{5}, therefore the maximum value of area S is:    [    boxed{frac{sqrt{5}}{5}}    ]"},{"instruction":"A ladder style tournament is held with  2016  participants. The players begin seeded  1,2,cdots 2016 . Each round, the lowest remaining seeded player plays the second lowest remaining seeded player, and the loser of the game gets eliminated from the tournament. After  2015  rounds, one player remains who wins the tournament. If each player has probability of  tfrac{1}{2}  to win any game, then the probability that the winner of the tournament began with an even seed can be expressed has  tfrac{p}{q}  for coprime positive integers  p  and  q . Find the remainder when  p  is divided by  1000 . [i]Proposed by Nathan Ramesh","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We have a ladder-style tournament with 2016 participants. Each player has a 50% chance of winning any game. We need to find the probability that the winner started with an even seed, expressed as a fraction (frac{p}{q}) in simplest form, and then find the remainder when (p) is divided by 1000. 2. **Probability Calculation:**    Each player has a (frac{1}{2}) chance of winning any game. The probability that a player with seed (n) wins the tournament is (frac{1}{2^{n-1}}). This is because the player needs to win (n-1) games to win the tournament. 3. **Summing Probabilities for Even Seeds:**    We need to sum the probabilities for all even seeds. The even seeds are (2, 4, 6, ldots, 2016). The probability for seed (2k) is (frac{1}{2^{2k-1}}).    The sum of probabilities for even seeds is:    [    sum_{k=1}^{1008} frac{1}{2^{2k-1}}    ] 4. **Geometric Series:**    This is a geometric series with the first term (a = frac{1}{2^1} = frac{1}{2}) and common ratio (r = frac{1}{4}). The number of terms (n = 1008).    The sum of a geometric series is given by:    [    S = a frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}    ]    Plugging in the values:    [    S = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1 - left(frac{1}{4}right)^{1008}}{1 - frac{1}{4}}    ] 5. **Simplifying the Sum:**    [    S = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1 - frac{1}{4^{1008}}}{frac{3}{4}} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{4}{3} left(1 - frac{1}{4^{1008}}right) = frac{2}{3} left(1 - frac{1}{4^{1008}}right)    ] 6. **Adding the Last Term:**    The last term in the series is (frac{1}{2^{2015}}). Adding this to the sum:    [    S = frac{2}{3} left(1 - frac{1}{4^{1008}}right) + frac{1}{2^{2015}}    ] 7. **Combining Terms:**    [    S = frac{2}{3} - frac{2}{3 cdot 4^{1008}} + frac{1}{2^{2015}}    ]    Since (4^{1008} = 2^{2016}):    [    S = frac{2}{3} - frac{2}{3 cdot 2^{2016}} + frac{1}{2^{2015}}    ]    Simplifying further:    [    S = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{2^{2015}} - frac{2}{3 cdot 2^{2016}}    ]    [    S = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{2^{2015}} - frac{1}{3 cdot 2^{2015}}    ]    [    S = frac{2}{3} + frac{1 - frac{2}{3}}{2^{2015}} = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3 cdot 2^{2015}}    ] 8. **Final Simplification:**    [    S = frac{2^{2015}}{3 cdot 2^{2015}} + frac{1}{3 cdot 2^{2015}} = frac{1 + 2^{2015}}{3 cdot 2^{2015}}    ]    The numerator is (1 + 2^{2015}). 9. **Finding (p) Modulo 1000:**    We need to find the remainder when (p = 1 + 2^{2015}) is divided by 1000. Using modular arithmetic:    [    2^{2015} mod 1000    ]    Since (2^{10} = 1024 equiv 24 mod 1000), we can use repeated squaring:    [    2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 equiv 24^2 = 576 mod 1000    ]    Continuing this process, we find:    [    2^{2015} equiv 2^{15} mod 1000    ]    Calculating (2^{15} mod 1000):    [    2^{15} = 32768 equiv 768 mod 1000    ]    Therefore:    [    1 + 2^{2015} equiv 1 + 768 = 769 mod 1000    ]    Dividing by 3:    [    p = frac{769}{3} = 256 text{ remainder } 1    ]    Therefore, the remainder when (p) is divided by 1000 is:    [    boxed{923}    ]"},{"instruction":"Given an acute triangle ( triangle ABC ), the isosceles triangles ( triangle DAC ), ( triangle EAB ), and ( triangle FBC ) are constructed externally to ( triangle ABC ), such that ( DA = DC ), ( EA = EB ), ( FB = FC ), and the angles ( angle ADC = 2 angle BAC ), ( angle BEA = 2 angle ABC ), and ( angle CFB = 2 angle ACB ).

Given that triangle ABC is an acute triangle, we know that all internal angles are strictly less than half turn (180 degrees):        angle A + angle B + angle C = pi        Since angle A + angle B + angle C < pi, the angles angle ADC, angle BEA, and angle CFB are also less than pi:        angle ADC = 2 angle BAC, quad angle BEA = 2 angle ABC, quad angle CFB = 2 angle ACB         2. Let’s determine the excentral angles:        angle A = angle BAC, quad angle B = angle ABC, quad angle C = angle ACB        Since the triangle is acute, we can express these angles in terms of internal angles:     - The angle angle DAC which supplementary to angle BAC:       [       angle DAC = frac{1}{2} (pi - angle BAC) = frac{pi}{2} - angle BAC       ]     - The angle angle BAE:       [       angle BAE = frac{1}{2} (pi - angle ABC) = frac{pi}{2} - angle ABC       ]     - The angle angle BCF:       [       angle BCF = frac{1}{2} (pi - angle ACB) = frac{pi}{2} - angle ACB       ] 3. Considering the sums of these angles, let's calculate angle DAE:    [    angle DAE = angle DAC + angle BAC + angle BAE = left( frac{pi}{2} - angle BAC right) + angle BAC + left( frac{pi}{2} - angle ABC right)    ]    Simplifying:    [    angle DAE = pi - angle ABC < pi    ]    The acute nature ensures that angle EBF<pi and angle FCD<pi as well. 4. Therefore, the hexagon (ABCDEF) is a convex one. We also have:    [    angle ADC + angle BEA + angle CFB = 2 (angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB) = 2pi    ] 5. Let omega_1, omega_2, omega_3 be the circles centered at D, E, and F respectively, each having radius equal to DA, EB, and FC. 6. As previously stated, the sum angle ADC + angle BEA + angle CFB equals 2 pi, so the circles omega_1, omega_2, omega_3 intersect at one common point, denoted as (O). This point (O) is key to the interpretation of our fractions:    [    frac{DB}{DD^{prime}} = frac{DD^{prime} + D^{prime} B}{DD^{prime}} = 1 + frac{D^{prime} B}{DD^{prime}} = 1 + frac{S_{triangle EFO}}{S_{triangle EFD}}    ]    Similarly, the other expressions are found:    [    frac{EC}{EE^{prime}} = 1 + frac{S_{triangle DFO}}{S_{triangle EFD}}    ]    [    frac{FA}{FF^{prime}} = 1 + frac{S_{triangle DEO}}{S_{triangle EFD}}    ] 7. Summing these, we get:    [    frac{DB}{DD^{prime}} + frac{EC}{EE^{prime}} + frac{FA}{FF^{prime}} = 3 + frac{S_{triangle EFO} + S_{triangle DFO} + S_{triangle DEO}}{S_{triangle EFD}}    ] 8. Since the sum of the areas (S_{triangle EFO} + S_{triangle DFO} + S_{triangle DEO}) is exactly (S_{triangle EFD}), it follows that:    [    frac{DB}{DD^{prime}} + frac{EC}{EE^{prime}} + frac{FA}{FF^{prime}} = 3 + 1 = 4    ] # Conclusion:  boxed{4}"},{"instruction":"Given the function y=f(x) has the domain [1,4], then the domain of y=f(2x1) is (    ) A: [0, frac{5}{2}] B: [1,4] C: [5,5] D: [3,7]","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the domain of a function and how to find it.

Evaluate ( f(x) ) at ( x = omega ):    [    f(omega) = omega^{2k} + 1 + (omega + 1)^{2k}    ]    Since ( omega^3 = 1 ), we have ( omega^2 = omega^{-1} ) and ( omega + 1 = -omega^2 ). Thus,    [    f(omega) = omega^{2k} + 1 + (-omega^2)^{2k} = omega^{2k} + 1 + omega^{4k}    ] 3. For ( f(x) ) to be divisible by ( x^2 + x + 1 ), ( f(omega) ) must be zero:    [    omega^{2k} + 1 + omega^{4k} = 0    ] 4. Since ( omega^3 = 1 ), we can write ( omega^{4k} = omega^{4k mod 3} ). Therefore, the equation becomes:    [    omega^{2k} + 1 + omega^{4k mod 3} = 0    ] 5. For ( omega^{2k} + 1 + omega^{4k mod 3} = 0 ) to hold, ( 2k mod 3 ) and ( 4k mod 3 ) must satisfy the equation. This implies that ( k ) must be a multiple of 3. 6. If ( k ) is not a multiple of 3, then ( f(omega) neq 0 ), and thus ( f(x) ) is not divisible by ( x^2 + x + 1 ). Therefore, the value of ( k ) such that ( f(x) ) is not divisible by ( x^2 + x + 1 ) is when ( k ) is not a multiple of 3. # Part ii) Given the polynomial ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ) with roots ( p, q, r ), we need to find the value of ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ). 1. By Vieta's formulas, we know:    [    p + q + r = 1, quad pq + qr + rp = 1, quad pqr = 2    ] 2. Using the identity for the sum of cubes:    [    p^3 + q^3 + r^3 - 3pqr = (p+q+r)(p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - pq - qr - rp)    ] 3. Substitute the known values:    [    p^3 + q^3 + r^3 - 3 cdot 2 = 1 cdot (p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - pq - qr - rp)    ] 4. Simplify ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) using the square of the sum of the roots:    [    (p+q+r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp)    ]    [    1^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2 cdot 1    ]    [    1 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2    ]    [    p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1    ] 5.

The condition ( 1059 equiv 1417 equiv 2312 pmod{d} ) implies:    [    d mid (1417 - 1059), quad d mid (2312 - 1417), quad d mid (2312 - 1059)    ] 2. Calculate the differences:    [    1417 - 1059 = 358, quad 2312 - 1417 = 895, quad 2312 - 1059 = 1253    ] 3. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 358, 895, and 1253:    [    gcd(358, 895, 1253) = 179    ] 4. Therefore, ( d = 179 ). 5. Find the common remainder ( r ):    [    1059 equiv 1417 equiv 2312 equiv 164 pmod{179}    ] 6.

The product can be written as:    [    prod_{k=0}^{n} 2^{frac{2k+1}{7}} = 2^{sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{2k+1}{7}}    ] 2. Simplify the exponent:    [    sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{2k+1}{7} = frac{1}{7} sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k+1)    ] 3. The sum of the first ( n+1 ) odd numbers is:    [    sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k+1) = (n+1)^2    ] 4. Therefore, the exponent becomes:    [    frac{(n+1)^2}{7}    ] 5.

The GCD of 7,125 and 11,875 is 1,125. Suresh's share / GCD = 7,125 / 1,125 = 6 Ramesh's share / GCD = 11,875 / 1,125 = 10.5 So the simplified ratio of their profits is: Suresh's share : Ramesh's share = 6 : 10.5 Since the profit is directly proportional to the investment, the ratio of their investments will be the same as the ratio of their profits.

Let BX:CX = x:(1-x), where 0 < x < 1. 3. **Area Calculation**:     The area of triangle ABC can be denoted as A. The parallelogram's area can be determined by the product of the base and height. If the parallelogram is split by a diagonal (bisecting it into two equal parts), the areas of the two triangles formed (PQB and PRC) can be analyzed.          The area of triangle PQB relative to triangle ABC is x, and the area of triangle PRC relative to triangle ABC is (1-x).

Thus, equation simplifies to: [ (n + 8)^2 equiv 68 pmod{17} ] 6. Because 68 ≡ 0 mod 17, the equation becomes: [ (n + 8)^2 equiv 0 pmod{17} ] 7. This implies: [ n + 8 equiv 0 pmod{17} ] 8.

Since ( 289 = 17^2 ), if ( n^2 - n - 4 ) is to be divisible by 289, we begin with: [ n^2 - n - 4 = (n + 8)^2 - 68 ] 2. For divisibility by 289: [ (n + 8)^2 - 68 equiv 0 pmod{289} ] 3. Simplifying, it implies: [ (n + 8)^2 equiv 68 pmod{289} ] 4. Observe ( gcd(289, 68) = 1 ), meaning 68 isn’t a multiple of 289. 5.

The probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day is 12%. How many days does Karen pack peanut butter sandwiches?","output":"Let's denote the number of days Karen packs peanut butter sandwiches as ( P ) and the number of days she packs ham sandwiches as ( H ). We know that ( H = 3 ) because it's given that she packs a ham sandwich on 3 school days. The probability of packing a piece of cake on any given day is ( frac{1}{5} ) because there are 5 school days in a week and she packs cake on one of them. The probability of packing a ham sandwich on any given day is ( frac{H}{5} = frac{3}{5} ) because she packs a ham sandwich on 3 out of the 5 days. The probability that Karen packs a ham sandwich and cake on the same day is the product of the individual probabilities because the events are independent. So, we have: [ frac{1}{5} times frac{3}{5} = 0.12 ] Solving for the probability: [ frac{3}{25} = 0.12 ] This equation is not correct because ( frac{3}{25} ) is actually ( 0.12 ).

Consider the polynomial equation ( x^3 + *x^2 + *x + * = 0 ) given with the three stars (*) to be replaced by rational numbers. 2. Petya and Vasya alternately replace the stars with rational numbers; Petya starts, then Vasya, then Petya again. Our goal is to determine if Petya can always manipulate the polynomial to get two roots differing by 2014, regardless of Vasya's actions. 3. **Petya's First Move:**     - Petya can choose to replace the free term (the constant term) with 0. This simplifies our equation to ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx = 0 ). The equation now must have a root at ( x = 0 ). 4. Now, Petya's new task is to ensure another root ( t ), such that ( t = 2014 ). This guarantees the difference 2014 since one root is zero and another is 2014. 5. **After Vasya’s Move:**     - There are a few scenarios: Vasya could replace either ( ax^2 + *x = 0 ) or ( *x^2 + bx = 0 ). 6. **First Case: ( x^3 + ax^2 + *x = 0 )**     - Here, Petya can choose to replace ( * ) with (-t(t+a)).     - Thus, the polynomial becomes:         [         x^3 + ax^2 - t(t+a)x = 0         ]         Substituting ( t = 2014 ), the equation becomes:         [         x^3 + ax^2 - 2014(2014 + a)x = 0         ]         This gives roots at ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2014 ). 7. **Second Case: ( x^3 + *x^2 + bx = 0 )**     - In this case, Petya can choose to replace ( * ) with (frac{-(t^2 + b)}{t}).     - Thus, the polynomial becomes:         [         x^3 + frac{-(t^2 + b)}{t}x^2 + bx = 0         ]         Substituting ( t = 2014 ):         [         x^3 + frac{-(2014^2 + b)}{2014}x^2 + bx = 0         ]         This also ensures ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 2014 ). 8. Conclusion:     - As shown in both cases, Petya can always manipulate the choices to ensure the polynomial has roots differing by 2014 by appropriately replacing the terms left by Vasya.

Suppose (P) and (Q) are polynomials of degree (n) and (m) respectively. 3. By comparing the degrees on both sides of the equation, we see that the degree of (P(x + Q(y))) must equal the degree of (Q(x + P(y))). This implies:    [    deg(P) = deg(Q)    ]    Let (d) be the common degree of (P) and (Q). 4. Consider the case when (d = 0). This means both (P) and (Q) are constant polynomials.

(II) Since S_{triangle ABC}=S_{triangle ABD}+S_{triangle BCD}, S_{triangle ABC}=frac{1}{2}xysin frac{2pi}{3}=frac{sqrt{3}}{4}xy, S_{triangle ABD}=frac{1}{2}ysin frac{pi}{3}=frac{sqrt{3}}{4}y, S_{triangle BCD}=frac{1}{2}xsin frac{pi}{3}=frac{sqrt{3}}{4}x, So xy=x+y, So y=frac{x}{x-1},xin(1,+infty).

From the information given, we know that 8 people visited two stores each, which accounts for 8 * 2 = 16 visits.  Now, we have 23 total visits, and we've accounted for 16 of them. This leaves us with 23 - 16 = 7 visits to account for. Since 8 people visited two stores each, that leaves 12 - 8 = 4 people who have not been accounted for yet. These 4 people are responsible for the remaining 7 visits. If we want to maximize the number of stores visited by any one person, we would distribute the remaining visits to as few people as possible.  Let's assign as many of the remaining 7 visits to one person as we can. Since one person can't visit the same store twice, the maximum number of stores this person can visit is limited by the total number of stores, which is 8. So, if we have one person visit 7 different stores, that would account for all the remaining visits. However, we need to remember that everyone visited at least one store. This means that the remaining 3 people must visit at least one store each. Since we've already used up 7 of the stores for the one person, we have 1 store left for one of the remaining 3 people to visit. This means that the maximum number of stores anyone could have visited is 7, with the remaining 3 people visiting 1 store each.

First consider the case when there are only two colors, say red and black.","output":"In this problem, we need to prove that if each point of division on a circle can be associated with two non-intersecting, equally colored arcs sharing an endpoint at that point, then the entire circle can be divided into several equally colored arcs, i.e., the coloring is periodic.  Step-by-Step Proof Outline: 1. **Terminology and Initial Setup:**    Let us define our terms and notations for a clear understanding:    - Capital Latin letters ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) denote the division points on the circle.    - Small Greek letters denote the colored arcs with endpoints at the division points.    - The notation ( alpha = beta ) implies that arcs ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are equally colored.    - Let ( alpha mid ) denote the length of arc ( alpha ). We consider the positive direction around the circle to be clockwise. 2. **Definitions and Lemmas:**    We define a \\"symmetric arc\\" as an arc that has two equal smaller arcs at the beginning and end. Specifically, ( alpha ) is symmetric if there exist arcs ( beta, gamma, delta ) such that ( alpha = beta gamma = delta beta ).    **Lemma 1:**    If an arc ( alpha ) is minimal, then it is not symmetric. Prove this lemma independently. 3. **Main Lemma:**    The central part of the proof is to show that:    **Main Lemma:**    If we cut out an arc ( BA ) from the circle and glue point ( A ) to point ( B ), the new circle will still have the property that for every division point, there is a pair of non-intersecting, equally colored arcs sharing an endpoint at that point. 4. **Proof of Main Lemma:**    - We consider a new circle formed by cutting out arc ( BA ) and gluing point ( A ) to ( B ). Let ( alpha ) be the arc ( BA ) and ( AC ).    - We then consider a point ( M' ) on the new circle, not on the arc ( A'C' ), and the corresponding point ( M ) on the old circle.    - For point ( M ), let ( LM ) and ( MK ) be minimal pairs of equally colored arcs.    - By the conditions of the lemma, the arc ( ( gamma beta)) lies entirely within ( M'A' ), proving that the point ( A ) is the start of an equally colored arc ( beta ). Therefore, point ( M ) matches the pair of equally colored arcs ( gamma beta ) on the new circle. Hence, we maintain the conditions of the problem after modifying the circle. 5. **Induction Argument:**    We use induction on the number ( n ) of division points to prove periodicity of the coloring:    - **Base Case ( n = 2 ):**      For ( n = 2 ), it is obvious.    - **Induction Hypothesis:**      Assume the statement holds true for ( n = k ).    - **Induction Step ( n = k+1 ):**      Consider the circle divided into ( n = k+1 ) points. We focus on the point ( A ) having the longest minimal pair of arcs. If the entire circle is covered by this pair, the induction hypothesis holds.      If not, we cut out one of these minimal arcs and glue the endpoints together. By the Main Lemma, the new circle formed still satisfies the problem's conditions with fewer points. By the induction hypothesis, the coloring is periodic for the new circle and hence for the old circle, maintaining the periodicity. 6. **Final Lemma:**    **Lemma 2:**    If ( mid alpha mid  geq 0 ), ( alpha ) is non-symmetric and ( alpha alpha ldots alpha beta = ldots ), then ( mid alpha mid = mid ).    This lemma helps to establish that the length of the period is the length of the arc ( alpha ), and thus, the new circle is equivalent to the old one while maintaining periodicity. # Conclusion: From the above inductive proof and lemmas, we conclude that the entire circle can indeed be divided into several equally colored arcs, implying that the coloring is periodic.

Thus, we suppose f(x) = g(x) cdot h(x) where deg(g(x)) geq 1 and deg(h(x)) geq 1.     2. Evaluate the function f(x) at x = 0:     [     f(0) = 5 = g(0) cdot h(0)     ] 3. Since g(0) and h(0) are integers and 5 is a prime number, the possible integral pairs (g(0), h(0)) are (pm 1, pm 5). Hence, either |g(0)| = 1 or |h(0)| = 1. 4. Without loss of generality, assume |g(0)| = 1. Let the roots of g(x) be beta_1, beta_2, ldots, beta_r. Therefore, we can write g(x) = prod_{j=1}^{r} (x - beta_j). 5.

However, the definition of a prism does not restrict its base to being a parallelogram. A prism's base can be any polygon, including triangles, rectangles, and hexagons. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. - Statement B suggests it is impossible for a plane to divide a pyramid into two pyramids. However, by choosing a plane that intersects the pyramid starting from its apex and cutting through its base, the pyramid can indeed be divided into two smaller pyramids. This demonstrates that statement B is incorrect. - Statement C asserts that the base of a pyramid must be a triangle. This is not accurate as the base of a pyramid can be any polygon, including quadrilaterals and pentagons, not just triangles. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. - Finally, statement D posits that it is possible for a plane to divide a prism into two prisms. This is true. By slicing the prism with a plane parallel to its base, the prism can be divided into two smaller prisms, each maintaining the characteristic properties of a prism. Thus, statement D is correct. Given these evaluations: - A is incorrect because a prism's base can be various polygons. - B is incorrect because a pyramid can be divided into two pyramids with a strategic plane cut. - C is incorrect because a pyramid's base is not limited to triangles. - D is correct because a plane can indeed divide a prism into two prisms with a cut parallel to its base.

First, apply the angle-splitting technique with x = (x - φ) + φ, then use the sine formula for the sum of two angles to simplify the given function: f(x) = sin(x - 2φ). By analyzing the monotonicity of the sine function, we can find the interval in which the function is monotonically increasing. Compare this interval with the given interval [3π, frac{7π}{2}] to determine the range of φ. Given f(x) = sin(x) - 2cos(x - φ)sin(φ), = sin[(x - φ) + φ] - 2cos(x - φ)sin(φ), = sin(x - φ)cos(φ) + cos(x - φ)sin(φ) - 2cos(x - φ)sin(φ), = sin(x - φ)cos(φ) - cos(x - φ)sin(φ), = sin(x - 2φ).

Let the circumcircles of (triangle ABJ) and (triangle ACK) intersect at (O). We need to prove that (J, O, M) are collinear if and only if (M) is the midpoint of (BC). 2. **Assume (M) is the midpoint of (BC)**. Since (M) is the midpoint, (BM = CM). Let (O) be the circumcenter of (triangle ABC). By the properties of the circumcenter, (O) is equidistant from (B), (C), and (A).  3. **Angle Chasing**: Since (M) is the midpoint of (BC), the line through (M) perpendicular to (BC) is the perpendicular bisector of (BC). This implies that (M) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (BC), and thus (M) is equidistant from (B) and (C). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: Since (O) is the circumcenter, the quadrilaterals (ABJO) and (ACKO) are cyclic. This is because (O) lies on the circumcircles of (triangle ABJ) and (triangle ACK). 5. **Collinearity**: Since (K, J, M) lie on a common line perpendicular to (BC), and (O) is the circumcenter, (J, O, M) are collinear. This is because the perpendicular bisector of (BC) passes through (O) and (M), and since (J) lies on this line, (J, O, M) are collinear. 6. **Conversely, assume (J, O, M) are collinear**. Since (O) is the circumcenter, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of (BC). If (J, O, M) are collinear, then (M) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of (BC). This implies that (M) is equidistant from (B) and (C), hence (M) is the midpoint of (BC). 7. **Congruence of Triangles**: Since (angle BTM = 180^circ - angle JTB = angle BAC = angle KAC = angle KTC = angle MTC), we deduce that (triangle BTM cong triangle CTM) because they share side (TM) and a right angle. This congruence implies that (BM = CM), confirming that (M) is the midpoint of (BC). (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Let the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n} be S_n.

In mathematical terms, for each prime p, (p^4 - 1) should be divisible by q times r, and similarly for permutations of p, q, r. 2. **Key Observation:**    Let's determine the form of p^4 - 1.

Further, considering p^4 - 1 simplifies to:    [    p^4 - 1 = (p-1)(p+1)(p^2+1)    ]    Any prime number less than p cannot divide (p-1)(p+1)(p^2+1) completely. 4. **Analyzing the Factors:**    Since p is the smallest prime:    - p - 1 is less than p and cannot have factor p.    - p + 1 is slightly more than p but still contains no factors of p unless p + 1 = q (next smallest prime).    - Finally, p^2 + 1 cannot be too large, but it must contain both primes q and r at least as factors. 5. **Small Prime Examination:**    Start by examining p = 2 (the smallest prime number):    [    2^4 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15    ]    15 factors into 3 and 5, both primes. Thus:    [    15 = 3 times 5    ]    Hence, if p = 2, then the next primes q and r must be 3 and 5. 6. **Verification of Conditions:**    To confirm that the combination (2, 3, 5) fits all criteria:    - For p = 2, q = 3, r = 5:      [      2^4 - 1 = 15 = 3 times 5      ]    - For q = 3, p = 2, r = 5:      [      3^4 - 1 = 81 - 1 = 80; quad text{80 is divisible by } 2 times 5      ]    - For r = 5, p = 2, q = 3:      [      5^4 - 1 = 625 - 1 = 624; quad text{624 is divisible by } 2 times 3      ] Since the combination of primes (2, 3, 5) satisfies all the required conditions, the solution is: # Conclusion: [ boxed{{2, 3, 5}} ]"},{"instruction":"Solve the equation: a) 2 log _{2} x+log _{V overline{2}} x+log _{1 / 2} x=9; b) log _{V overline{2}}^{2} x+3 log _{2} x+log _{1 / 2} x=2; c) log _{5}^{2} x+log _{5 x} frac{5}{x}=1","output":"(а) Given the equation: [  2 log_{2} x + log_{sqrt{2}} x + log_{1 / 2} x = 9  ] 1.

For a regular dodecagon, the vertices are spaced such that each central angle between consecutive vertices is ( frac{360^circ}{12} = 30^circ ).

Out of the 64 small cubes:    - 20 small cubes have two adjacent red faces.    - 44 small cubes have two opposite red faces. We aim to construct a large cube from these 64 smaller ones, and we need to determine the maximum surface area of red faces on the large cube.

Step 4: Calculate Maximum Possible Red Surface Area To determine the maximum red surface area, place as many cubes as possible with their red faces exposed. Note that: - The maximum number of small cubes that can be on the exterior of a large cube is determined by the configuration of the larger cube's faces.

This is because the sum of angles in any triangle is 180^{circ}, and if one angle is 90^{circ}, the remaining two must sum up to 90^{circ}. 2. **Relation to cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B**: Given angle A + angle B = 90^{circ}, we can derive that cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B holds. This is because the cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the sine of the complementary angle, and vice versa, due to the co-function identity cos(theta) = sin(90^{circ}-theta). 3. **Counterexample for Necessity**: Consider the case when A = B. In this scenario, cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B naturally holds due to the equality of angles A and B. However, this does not imply angle C = 90^{circ}. This shows that while angle C = 90^{circ} guarantees cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B, the converse is not true. Therefore, angle C = 90^{circ} is not a necessary condition for cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B to hold. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, we conclude that \\"angle C = 90^{circ}\\" is a condition that is sufficient to ensure cos A + sin A = cos B + sin B holds, because it directly leads to this outcome.

If it will require 5 per person, and there are 6 friends, then the total cost is 6 friends * 5 per person = 30. Therefore, the cost of 4 boxes of ice cream bars is 30.

Thus, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{3} = 1}. Step-by-step explanation: 1.

The shape is a triangle since ( 2n+1 = 3 ).        - A triangle has no diagonals.    - Any two adjacent vertices in the triangle can be given different colors.        So, the base case holds true since we can color a triangle such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 2. **Inductive Step**:        Assume that for any ( k leq n ), a ((2k+1))-gon can be colored such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.    Now, consider a ((2(k+1)+1))-gon, which is a ((2k+3))-gon.    Let the vertices be ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2k+3} ).        - Select an arbitrary vertex, say ( A_1 ).    - Ensure ( A_1 ) and its adjacent vertices ( A_2 ) and ( A_{2k+3} ) are colored differently.        To do this, assume a contradiction where all adjacent vertices to every vertex are the same color. This leads to an inconsistency since ( 2k+3 ) is odd. Hence, at least one vertex must have adjacent vertices of different colors. 3. **Splitting into Subproblems**:        Consider the diagonal ( A_2A_{2k+3} ):        - This diagonal splits the ((2k+3))-gon into a triangle ( triangle A_1A_2A_{2k+3} ) and a ((2k+2))-gon ( A_2A_3ldots A_{2k+3} ). 4. **Delving into ((2k+2))-gon**:    - Inside this ( (2k+2) )-gon, consider the vertices ( A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{2k+3} ).        - Utilizing the induction hypothesis, the ((2k+2))-gon can be colored such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Within this structure, different color patterns ensure that vertices adjacent within the same small sub-problems also adapt different coloring methods. 5. **Combining Subproblems**:        - By connecting ( A_1 ) to these vertices ( A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{2k+3} ), we obtain several triangles from the ( (2k+3) )-gon configuration.        - Each triangle in ( triangle A_1A_2A_{2k+3} ) and all necessary triangles in the ((2k+2))-gon, also observe vertices with distinct colors at their endpoints, fulfilling the overall coloring requirements by our inductive hypothesis again extending it to our ( (2k + 3) )-gon setting.

Part (a): Ascending the Staircase 1. **Define the Problem:**    Let ( a_n ) be the number of ways to ascend a staircase with ( n ) steps, given that one can either jump 1 step or 2 steps at a time. 2. **Base Cases:**    - For 1 step: There is only one way to be on the first step, i.e., ( a_1 = 1 ).    - For 2 steps: There are two ways to ascend directly (1 step + 1 step or a single 2-step jump), i.e., ( a_2 = 2 ). 3. **Recursive Formula:**    If Alex is currently on the ( n )-th step, he could have arrived there from:    - ( n-1 ) steps by taking a 1-step jump.    - ( n-2 ) steps by taking a 2-step jump.

Suppose a is the first term of the geometric progression. Given the sequence has 37 natural numbers and the first and last terms are coprime.    2. Let the common ratio of the geometric progression be frac{m}{n}, where frac{m}{n} is in simplest form (i.e., m and n are coprime integers).  3. The last term of the progression, which is the 37th term, is given by:    [    a left(frac{m}{n}right)^{36}    ] 4. Since the first term (a) and the last term (a left(frac{m}{n}right)^{36}) are coprime, we can infer something about the nature of these terms. Specifically, the form (a left(frac{m}{n}right)^{36}) tells us that     [    a n^{36}    ]    should be coprime with     [    m^{36}.    ] 5. Since (a) can be written in terms of some integer (b) that ensures (a) and (m^{36}) are coprime, we can write:    [    a = b n^{36}    ]    where (b) would have to be an integer such that (b) and (m^{36}) are still coprime.  6. From (a = b n^{36}), and considering (a left(frac{m}{n}right)^{36}) thus becomes (b (m^{36})), and since (b n^{36}) and (b m^{36}) should be coprime, it implies (b) needs to be 1 to satisfy the mutual coprimeness of the first and last terms. Therefore:    [    a = n^{36}    ] 7. Now focusing on the 19th term of the geometric progression, we get:    [    a left(frac{m}{n}right)^{18}    ] 8. Substituting (a = n^{36}) into the above expression for the 19th term, we have:    [    n^{36} left(frac{m}{n}right)^{18} = n^{36} frac{m^{18}}{n^{18}} = m^{18} n^{18}    ] # Conclusion: The 19th term of the geometric progression is: [ boxed{m^{18} n^{18}} ]"},{"instruction":"A decorative plate consists of a white square with sides of four meters, painted symmetrically with grey parts, as shown in the figure.

We explore possible positions for the other two shaded squares: - **Two other corners**: There are three other corners.

(II) Determine the intervals of increase and decrease for f(x).","output":"(I) The derivative of f(x) is f'(x)=ax-2a-1+frac{2}{x}. Therefore, the slopes of the tangents at x=1 and x=3 are f'(1)=-a+1 and f'(3)=3a - frac{1}{3} respectively. Since the tangents are parallel, we have f'(1)=f'(3). This gives us the equation -a+1=3a-frac{1}{3}. Solving for a yields a=boxed{frac{2}{3}}. (II) Revisiting the derivative, we have f'(x) = frac{ax^2-(2a+1)x+2}{x} for x > 0. The function f(x) will increase when f'(x) > 0 and decrease when f'(x) < 0. For a=0, the derivative becomes f'(x)=frac{-x+2}{x}. This is positive when 0 < x < 2 and negative when x > 2. Consequently, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (0,2) and decreasing on the interval (2,+infty). Let g(x)=ax^2-(2a+1)x+2. If 0 < a < frac{1}{2}, the quadratic equation ax^2-(2a+1)x+2=0 has roots x_1=2 and x_2=frac{1}{a}, and 2 < frac{1}{a}. Thus, g(x) > 0 for x in (0,2) cup left(frac{1}{a}, +inftyright), and g(x) < 0 for x in (2, frac{1}{a}). Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0,2) and left(frac{1}{a},+inftyright), and decreasing on (2, frac{1}{a}). If a = frac{1}{2}, we have g(x) geq 0, so f(x) is increasing on the entire interval (0,+infty). For a > frac{1}{2}, the quadratic equation's roots are x_1=frac{1}{a} and x_2=2, with frac{1}{a} < 2. Here, g(x) > 0 for x in (0, frac{1}{a}) cup (2,+infty), and g(x) < 0 for x in left(frac{1}{a}, 2right). This means f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{a}) and (2,+infty), and decreasing on left(frac{1}{a}, 2right). For a < 0, the roots of the equation ax^2-(2a+1)x+2=0 are x_1=frac{1}{a} and x_2=2, with frac{1}{a} < 0. It follows that g(x) > 0 for x in (0,2), and g(x) < 0 for x in (2,+infty). Thus, f(x) is increasing on (0,2) and decreasing on (2,+infty). In summary: - For a leq 0, f(x) is increasing on (0,2) and decreasing on (2,+infty). - For 0 < a < frac{1}{2}, f(x) is increasing on (0,2) and left(frac{1}{a},+inftyright), and decreasing on (2, frac{1}{a}). - For a = frac{1}{2}, f(x) is an increasing function on the entire interval (0,+infty). - For a > frac{1}{2}, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{a}) and (2,+infty), and decreasing on left(frac{1}{a}, 2right)."},{"instruction":"Among the numbers frac{1}{7}, pi, 0.314, sqrt{2}, sqrt{64}, and 5, the number of irrational numbers is ( ).

Each pair of pants costs 12 and she bought 3 pairs, so the total cost for the pants is: 3 pairs of pants * 12/pair = 36 Now, let's calculate the total cost of the jackets. Each jacket costs 30 and she bought 4 jackets, so the total cost for the jackets is: 4 jackets * 30/jacket = 120 Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items she bought: Total cost = Cost of dresses + Cost of pants + Cost of jackets Total cost = 100 + 36 + 120 Total cost = 256 Rita had 400 initially and now has 139 left. The difference between what she had initially and what she has now is the total amount she spent, including transportation: Amount spent = Initial amount - Remaining amount Amount spent = 400 - 139 Amount spent = 261 Since we know the total amount she spent on clothes is 256, we can find out how much she spent on transportation by subtracting the cost of clothes from the total amount spent: Transportation cost = Total amount spent - Cost of clothes Transportation cost = 261 - 256 Transportation cost = 5 Rita spent boxed{5}  on transportation."},{"instruction":"Given that the vertex of angle (alpha) is at the origin, and its initial side coincides with the positive halfaxis of (x),   ((1)) If the terminal side passes through point (P(1,2)), find the value of (sin alpha cos alpha);   ((2)) If the terminal side of angle (alpha) is on the line (y=3x), find the value of (tan alpha + dfrac {3}{cos alpha}).","output":"Solution:   ((1)) According to the definition of trigonometric functions:   (sin alpha= dfrac {y}{r}= dfrac {y}{ sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}= dfrac {2}{ sqrt {5}}),   (cos alpha= dfrac {x}{r}= dfrac {x}{ sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}=- dfrac {1}{ sqrt {5}}),   Therefore, (sin alpha cos alpha=- dfrac {2}{5}).

In this scenario, the quadratic equation simplifies to 1x^{2}+1=0, which doesn't provide a valid solution under the given conditions. Correcting the approach for this case, when substituting k = -2 into the original equation, we actually find ourselves evaluating the equation 0cdot x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0, which simplifies to -4x + 1 = 0, leading to x = frac{1}{4}.

This is the length of the longest possible segment whose vertices are in the interior or on the sides of quadrilateral (ABCD). 3. **Condition for (ABCD) not being rude:**    - For (ABCD) to not be rude, the sum of the diagonals of any quadrilateral (PQRS) inside (ABCD) must be less than or equal to the sum of the diagonals of (ABCD).    - This implies (PR + QS leq 2d).

For which values of (m) and (n) is this possible? To solve this problem, we need to determine for which dimensions (m) and (n) the (m times n) board can be partitioned into shapes comprising exactly ten unit squares each.  1. **Divisibility by 10**:     - Since each shape consists of 10 squares, the total number of squares on the board, (mn), must be divisible by 10. Thus, either (m) or (n) (or both) must be divisible by 2 and 5. In other words, among (m) and (n), one must be divisible by 2 (even) and one must be divisible by 5. 2. **Divisibility by 4**:     - Now, we need to ensure that the board can be properly partitioned into rectangular sections that can be covered by the 10-unit shapes. We will show that one of (m) or (n) must be divisible by 4. Suppose this is not true. Let us draw horizontal and vertical lines through the board at intervals of 2 cells, starting from the top and left edges of the board. This will divide the board into (2 times 2) squares, and possibly strips of (2 times 1) rectangles if (n) is odd.     - Consider a strip of (2 times n) cut by these lines. Let's color this strip in a checkerboard pattern using black and white colors. In such a strip, if (n) is not divisible by 4, the number of black (or white) cells will not be equal in any two adjacent strips (2 times n). For instance, if (n = 4k + r) where (r = 1, 2, 3) (remainder), the difference will be evident when colored in a checkerboard fashion. 3. **Even Distribution**:     - Consider the composition of a shape formed by ten unit cells. This means that the composition of white and black cells in each column will not balance out to an equal number of black and white cells:     [     underbrace{10 text{ cells}}_{text{shape}} = underbrace{5 text{ black cells}} + underbrace{5 text{ white cells}}     ]     - Therefore, if there are rows and columns in such a manner, the (m times n) grid must have an even partition that respects this distribution (i.e., contains equal numbers of each color in every possible partition). 4. **Contradiction Approach**:     - Drawing from a mathematical contradiction proof:         - Suppose neither (m) nor (n) is divisible by 4 (both are odd multiples of 2 but not 4).          - The horizontal lines at 2-cell intervals will create inconsistencies in black and white cell counts across stripes horizontally and vertically. 5. **Concluding Criterion**:     - The above contradiction illustrates that for a consistent, balanced partition, allowing for (5 times 4) layouts repeatedly (rectangular regions that can fit such 10-unit shapes perfectly):         [         boxed{text{Among (m) and (n), one must be divisible by 4 and the other by 5.}}         ]     - General dimensions will then be multiples of these standards allowing manageable segment partitions into (4 times 5) sections. For arbitrary large (m, n > 15), this ensures every possible partition works out equally.

The area of the walls is calculated by adding the area of the two pairs of opposite walls. The area of the longer walls (25 feet by 12 feet) is: 2 * (25 feet * 12 feet) = 2 * 300 square feet = 600 square feet The area of the shorter walls (15 feet by 12 feet) is: 2 * (15 feet * 12 feet) = 2 * 180 square feet = 360 square feet The total area of the four walls is: 600 square feet + 360 square feet = 960 square feet Next, we need to subtract the area of the door and the windows since they will not be whitewashed. The area of the door (6 feet by 3 feet) is: 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet The area of one window (4 feet by 3 feet) is: 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet Since there are 3 windows, the total area of the windows is: 3 * 12 square feet = 36 square feet Now, subtract the area of the door and windows from the total wall area: 960 square feet - 18 square feet - 36 square feet = 906 square feet Finally, we calculate the cost of whitewashing the remaining area at Rs. 3 per square foot: 906 square feet * Rs. 3 per square foot = Rs. 2718 Therefore, the cost of whitewashing the four walls of the room, after accounting for the door and windows, is Rs. boxed{2718} ."},{"instruction":"Lance wants to finish reading a 100 page book in 3 days.

What is the minimum number of planes required such that their union covers ( S ) but does not contain the point ((0,0,0))?","output":"1. Define the set ( S ) as follows: [ S = { (x, y, z) : x, y, z in {0, 1, ldots, n}, x + y + z > 0 } ] 2. The total number of points in a cube of side length ( n+1 ) is: [ (n+1)^3 ] 3. Since we need to exclude the point ((0,0,0)), the number of points in ( S ) is: [ (n+1)^3 - 1 ] 4. We need to determine the minimum number of planes required to cover ( S ) but not the origin ((0, 0, 0)). 5. Consider the planes ( x = i ), ( y = i ), and ( z = i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). Each set of planes will cover points where the respective coordinate takes a specific value:    - ( x = i ) covers all points with ( x = i ),    - ( y = i ) covers all points with ( y = i ),    - ( z = i ) covers all points with ( z = i ). 6. There are ( n ) such planes for each coordinate, giving us a total of: [ 3n text{ planes} ] 7. To show that ( 3n ) planes indeed cover the set ( S ), but not ((0,0,0)), observe:    - Each plane ( x = i ), ( y = i ), and ( z = i ) excludes the origin because none of them include ((0,0,0)),    - The union of these planes covers all points in ( S ) because for any ((x,y,z) in S), at least one of the coordinates ( x, y, ) or ( z ) is non-zero. 8. Now let's justify that ( 3n ) is the minimum number of planes required. We use a generalization for ( k ) variables. Consider the following reasoning based on polynomial degree arguments: 9. Define a non-zero polynomial ( P(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ) such that for all ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k in {0, 1, ldots, n} ) with ( x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_k > 0 ), the polynomial evaluates to zero, and ( P(0, 0, ldots, 0) neq 0 ). It is known from polynomial theory that: [ operatorname{deg} P geq k cdot n ] 10. Induction proof for the polynomial degree argument. For ( k = 1 ): [ P(x) = a_1 x + a_0 ] Since ( P(0) neq 0 ), the polynomial ( P(x) ) must contain at least one non-zero constant term: [ a_1 neq 0 ] Step hypothesis: Assume the conclusion is true for ( k - 1 ) variables. For ( k ) variables, write ( P(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ) and consider ( R(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) ), the remainder when divided by ( Q(y) = y(y-1) cdots (y-n) ). Since: [ operatorname{deg}_y R leq n ] and [ P(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) = Q(y) cdot R(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) ] 11. Then ( R(x_1, ldots, x_{k-1}, y) ) must satisfy the polynomial properties over ( y = 0, 1, ldots, n ), implying: [ operatorname{deg} R geq (k-1) cdot n ] Combining the degrees: [ operatorname{deg} P geq operatorname{deg} R + n geq kn ] 12. Finally, apply the polynomial argument to the context of planes in three dimensions. Suppose ( N ) planes cover ( S ) but not ( (0,0,0) ). Represent the planes as: [ a_i x + b_i y + c_i z + d_i = 0 ] The polynomial ( P(x, y, z) = prod_{i=1}^N (a_i x + b_i y + c_i z + d_i) ) will have a degree ( N ).

Then, u' = cos x - 1 and v' = 2x. Applying the quotient rule, we get: y' = frac{(sin x - x)' cdot x^2 - (sin x - x) cdot (x^2)'}{(x^2)^2} = frac{x^2(cos x - 1) - (sin x - x) cdot 2x}{x^4}. Now, we can simplify and rearrange the expression to obtain: y' = frac{x^2 cos x - x^2 - 2x sin x + 2x}{x^4} = frac{x cos x - 2 sin x + x}{x^3}. (3) To find the derivative of y = e^{-x} sqrt{2x - 1}, we will use the product rule and the chain rule. Let u = e^{-x} and v = sqrt{2x - 1}. Then, u' = -e^{-x} and v' = frac{1}{sqrt{2x - 1}} cdot 2 = frac{2}{sqrt{2x - 1}}. Applying the product rule, we get: y' = (e^{-x})' sqrt{2x - 1} + e^{-x} (sqrt{2x - 1})' = -e^{-x} sqrt{2x - 1} + e^{-x} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{2x - 1}}. To simplify this expression, we can factor out e^{-x}: y' = e^{-x} left(-sqrt{2x - 1} + frac{2}{sqrt{2x - 1}} right). Now, we can rationalize the denominator in the second term: y' = e^{-x} left(-sqrt{2x - 1} + frac{2}{sqrt{2x - 1}} cdot frac{sqrt{2x - 1}}{sqrt{2x - 1}} right) = e^{-x} left(-sqrt{2x - 1} + frac{2sqrt{2x - 1}}{2x - 1} right). Finally, we can find a common denominator and combine the terms: y' = e^{-x} left(frac{-(2x - 1)sqrt{2x - 1} + 2sqrt{2x - 1}}{2x - 1} right) = boxed{frac{e^{-x}(2 - 2x)sqrt{2x - 1}}{2x - 1}}."},{"instruction":"A total of 20 individuals are numbered 01, 02, cdots, 19, 20.

Now, let's calculate the number of pallets of paper plates. We know the total number of pallets (20) and the number of pallets for paper towels (10), tissues (5), and paper cups (1). So, the number of pallets of paper plates would be the remainder: Number of pallets of paper plates = Total pallets - (Pallets of paper towels + Pallets of tissues + Pallets of paper cups) Number of pallets of paper plates = 20 - (10 + 5 + 1) Number of pallets of paper plates = 20 - 16 Number of pallets of paper plates = 4 Now, to find the ratio of the number of pallets of paper plates to the total number of pallets, we have: Number of pallets of paper plates : Total number of pallets 4 : 20 This ratio can be simplified by dividing both terms by the greatest common divisor, which is 4: (4/4) : (20/4) 1 : 5 So, the ratio of the number of pallets of paper plates to the total number of pallets is boxed{1:5} ."},{"instruction":"Subtract a fraction from 4/5 to get a simplified answer of 0.6.

He then summoned the advisors and said:  It seems to me that the probability of making the correct decisions won't decrease if I keep only one advisor and follow their advice. If this is true, I must dismiss one of you. If not, I will keep everything as it is. Answer me, should I dismiss one of you?  Which one do you intend to dismiss, King Arthur?  asked the advisors.

Merlin, honest in all other matters, decides to give such an answer that minimizes the probability of his dismissal. What is the probability that Merlin will be dismissed?","output":"We need to determine whether Merlin will be fired under the given conditions. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the probabilities when there is one advisor**:     - With one advisor, say with a probability (p) of being correct, King Arthur will follow the correct advice with probability (p). 2. **Understanding the probabilities when there are two advisors**:     - If both advisors give the same answer, they are either both correct or both incorrect.         - Both advisors are correct: This occurs with probability (p^2) because each advisor has a probability (p) of being correct.         - Both advisors are incorrect: This occurs with probability (q^2) where (q = 1 - p). 3. **Probability distribution for different outcomes**:     - Both advisors give the correct answer: The king follows their advice with certainty (p^2 times 1).     - Both advisors give the incorrect answer: The king follows their incorrect advice with certainty (q^2 times 1).     - One advisor gives a correct answer and the other gives an incorrect answer: This occurs with probability (2pq). Since King Arthur flips a coin, he follows the correct advice with probability (frac{1}{2}). Thus, the effectiveness in this scenario is (2pq times frac{1}{2} = pq). 4. **Calculating the total probability of the king making the correct decision when he has two advisors**:     [     mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 times 1 + q^2 times 0 + pq = p^2 + pq     ] 5. **Simplifying the expression**:     [     mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 + pq     ] 6. **Since (p + q = 1)**:     [     p + q = 1 implies q = 1 - p     ]     [     therefore mathrm{P}(text{Correct Decision with Two Advisors}) = p^2 + p(1 - p) = p^2 + p - p^2 = p     ]     This shows that the probability of making the correct decision with one advisor is also (p). 7. **Conclusion on redundancy and decision to fire one advisor**:     - Since the probability (p) for making the correct decision remains unchanged with either one or two advisors, it indicates redundancy in maintaining two advisors. Therefore, one can be fired without affecting the decision-making accuracy of King Arthur. 8. **Considering Merlin’s strategic answer**:     - Merlin must consider the impact of his response on his job security. Persifal is honest and would say the optimal solution is to fire one of them because it doesn’t decrease the probability of making correct decisions.     - Merlin, thinking about minimizing his chance of being fired, would realize his optimal strategy aligns with being honest, as the correct answer is evident. 9. **Likelihood of being fired**:     - Since Merlin would say the same as Persifal (to fire one), the chance of Merlin being the one fired would be based on a coin flip if King Arthur decides to follow through with the dismissal.

Thus, it is sufficient to demonstrate that the vector sum mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4 is parallel to the vector overrightarrow{OK}. 3. **Inversion with respect to the Circumcircle**:     - Invert the quadrilateral with respect to its circumcircle centered at K. Points A_i map to A_i' in this inversion.     - For any point outside the circle, its inverse is found by drawing tangents from it to the circle and taking the midpoint of the segment connecting the points of tangency.     - Therefore, A_1', A_2', A_3', A_4' are the midpoints of the segments B_4B_1, B_1B_2, B_2B_3, B_3B_4 respectively.     - The quadrilateral A_1'A_2'A_3'A_4' is thus the midline quadrilateral of B_1B_2B_3B_4, meaning its vertices are the midpoints of the sides of B_1B_2B_3B_4. 4. **Properties of the Midline Quadrilateral**:     - The midline quadrilateral of a cyclic quadrilateral (like B_1B_2B_3B_4) is a rectangle.     - Therefore, A_1'A_2'A_3'A_4' is a rectangle inscribed in a circle (the image of k under inversion). 5. **Calculation**:     - Using the parallelogram properties, compute the center C of the rectangle A_1'A_2'A_3'A_4':      overrightarrow{OC} = frac{1}{4}left( overrightarrow{OA_1'} + overrightarrow{OA_2'} + overrightarrow{OA_3'} + overrightarrow{OA_4'} right) = frac{1}{4} left( mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4 right).  6. **Possible Cases**:     - If mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4 = mathbf{0}, then C coincides with O, which means K is also O.     - If mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4 neq mathbf{0}, then C and O are distinct points, and overrightarrow{OC} is parallel to mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4. 7. **Alignment**:     - Since the centers of the circle and its inverse must lie on the line through the inversion's center, O, C, and K are collinear.     - Thus, overrightarrow{OK} is parallel to mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{b}_2 + mathbf{b}_3 + mathbf{b}_4. # Conclusion: We have shown that either the resultant of the unit vectors parallel to the sides is zero, or is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the inscribed and circumscribed circles.

Hence, the scenario limits would have:    [    frac{6300^circ}{37} approx 170.27^circ    ]    Although the ceiling value of any single angle cannot exceed 180^circ since theta le 180^circ in convex context. 6. Therefore, consider combinations ensuring non-triple replication. Let k denote the highest repeatable angles. 7.

For the quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 2sintheta x + frac{1}{4}, setting theta = frac{pi}{6} gives us:    [ f(x) = x^2 - x + frac{1}{4} = left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 ]    On the interval x in [-1, 1], the vertex form of the parabola shows its vertex at left(frac{1}{2}, 0right), which lies outside the given interval. Therefore, the range is obtained by evaluating the function at the endpoints of the interval:    [ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - (-1) + frac{1}{4} = frac{9}{4} ]    [ f(1) = (1)^2 - (1) + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4} ]    The range of the function on x in [-1, 1] is [frac{1}{4}, frac{9}{4}], with the values squared due to the parabolic shape and symmetry about the y-axis. Therefore, the range of f(x) is boxed{ left[ frac{1}{4}, frac{9}{4} right] }. 2. The quadratic function f(x) = x^2 - 2sintheta x + frac{1}{4} can be rewritten as (x - sintheta)^2 + frac{1}{4} - sin^2theta. Since the interval is symmetric around zero, the function f(x) is monotonic on left[-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right] if the vertex of the parabola, at x = sintheta, lies outside the interval. Thus:    - For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing, we must have sintheta geq frac{1}{2}.    - For f(x) to be monotonically increasing, we must have sintheta leq -frac{1}{2}.    These conditions correspond to the intervals for theta being left[frac{pi}{6} + 2kpi, frac{5pi}{6} + 2kpiright] or left[frac{7pi}{6} + 2kpi, frac{11pi}{6} + 2kpiright] where k in mathbb{Z}.

Since the axis of symmetry x = sintheta leq 1, the function is monotonically increasing on the interval [2, 3].

Therefore, C is incorrect. For option D: y=x^2+ frac {1}{x^{2}+1}+3=x^2+1+ frac {1}{x^{2}+1}+2 geq 2+2=4, and the equality holds if and only if x^2+1= frac {1}{x^{2}+1}, i.e., when x=0.

Thus, this event is random and cannot be considered certain. - **Event B**: For any real number a, we consider the expression a^{2}+1. Since a^{2} geq 0 for all real numbers a (because squaring any real number, whether positive, negative, or zero, results in a non-negative value), adding 1 to a^{2} will always result in a value strictly greater than 0. Therefore, a^{2}+1 gt 0 is true for all real numbers a, making this event certain. - **Event C**: The occurrence of a World Cup soccer match on TV at the moment of turning it on is dependent on the TV schedule and the timing, which are variable factors. Hence, this event is random and not certain. - **Event D**: The statement that the best result of a high jump athlete is 100m is beyond the realm of human capability, as current world records and human physical limits are far below this mark.

Compactness - The Cantor set mathscr{C} is defined as a subset of the closed interval [0, 1]. - By construction, mathscr{C} is closed, as it is the complement of a countable union of open intervals. - In the space mathbb{R}, a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. - Since mathscr{C} is a closed subset of the bounded interval [0, 1], it is also bounded.    Thus, by Heine-Borel Theorem, which states that a subset of mathbb{R} is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, mathscr{C} is compact.  2. Perfectness - By construction, mathscr{C} is obtained by successively removing the middle thirds of open intervals. - Every point in mathscr{C} can be represented as a limit of other points in mathscr{C}. This ensures that every point in mathscr{C} is a limit point of mathscr{C}. - No point in mathscr{C} is isolated. Therefore, mathscr{C} is perfect.  3. Nowhere Density - If mathscr{C} were dense in some interval (a, b), then mathscr{C} would have to contain an open set within (a, b). - Since mathscr{C} is closed, this would imply that mathscr{C} contains the entire interval (a, b), because the interval (a, b) would be part of mathscr{C}. - Measuring the Cantor set using the Lebesgue measure, we realize it has measure zero, i.e., the total length of the removed open intervals equals one, which means:  frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{9} + frac{4}{27} + frac{8}{81} + ldots = 1.  - Hence, the Lebesgue measure of mathscr{C} is zero, so mathscr{C} cannot contain any interval with positive length. - Therefore, mathscr{C} is nowhere dense, as it doesn't contain any interval of positive length. # Conclusion Therefore, the Cantor set mathscr{C} is compact, perfect, and nowhere dense. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given positive integers x and y such that frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{3y} = frac{1}{8}, what is the least possible value of xy?","output":"Multiplying through by 24xy to clear the denominators, we have:  24y + 8x = 3xy  Rearrange and reformulate the equation:  3xy - 8x - 24y = 0  Add 64 to both sides (here, 8^2 to balance the equation and allow factoring):  3xy - 8x - 24y + 64 = 64  Factoring the left-hand side, we get:  (3x-8)(y-8) = 64  Since 64 has positive integer factor pairs (1, 64), (2, 32), (4, 16), (8, 8), we consider these solutions for (3x-8, y-8).

We know that 1 km/hr is equal to (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) = 5/18 m/s. So, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed (m/s) = 200 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed (m/s) = (200 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed (m/s) = (1000/18) m/s Relative speed (m/s) ≈ 55.56 m/s The combined length of both trains is: Combined length = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Combined length = 1.10 km + 0.9 km Combined length = 2.00 km We need to convert this combined length into meters: Combined length (m) = 2.00 km * 1000 m/km Combined length (m) = 2000 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the slower train to cross the faster train using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time (s) = Combined length (m) / Relative speed (m/s) Time (s) = 2000 m / 55.56 m/s Time (s) ≈ 36 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{36}  seconds for the slower train to cross the faster train."},{"instruction":"a national 100meter sprint competition, 300 sprinters enter.

What is the probability that all three balls have even numbers and are multiples of 5?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of even numbers that are multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. An even number that is a multiple of 5 will end in 0 or 5, but since we are looking for even numbers, we only consider those ending in 0. The even multiples of 5 between 1 and 50 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So, there are 5 such numbers. Now, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 balls that are all even multiples of 5. Since the balls are drawn without replacement, the number of possible outcomes changes with each draw. The probability of drawing the first ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 5/50, because there are 5 favorable outcomes out of 50 possible outcomes. After drawing the first ball, there are now 4 even multiples of 5 left and 49 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a second ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 4/49. After drawing the second ball, there are now 3 even multiples of 5 left and 48 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a third ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 3/48. To find the overall probability of all three events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event: P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = P(first ball is even multiple of 5) * P(second ball is even multiple of 5) * P(third ball is even multiple of 5) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (5/50) * (4/49) * (3/48) Now, let's calculate this: P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (1/10) * (4/49) * (1/16) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (1/10) * (1/49) * (1/4) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = 1/1960 So, the probability that all three balls drawn without replacement have even numbers and are multiples of 5 is boxed{1/1960} ."},{"instruction":"Johnson owns a hectare cornfield that can yield some corn every two months, while his neighbor owns a twohectare cornfield and each hectare can yield twice the amount as Johnson.

Johnson's neighbor has a two-hectare cornfield, and each hectare yields twice the amount of Johnson's. Therefore, each hectare of the neighbor's field yields ( 2J ) corns every two months, and since there are two hectares, the total yield for the neighbor every two months is ( 2 times 2J = 4J ) corns. Over six months, there are three two-month periods. So, Johnson will harvest ( 3J ) corns in six months, and his neighbor will harvest ( 3 times 4J = 12J ) corns in the same period. Together, they harvest 1200 corns in six months. So, we can write the equation: [ 3J + 12J = 1200 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 15J = 1200 ] Now, we solve for ( J ): [ J = frac{1200}{15} ] [ J = 80 ] Therefore, Johnson's hectare can yield boxed{80}  corns every two months."},{"instruction":"Restore the isosceles triangle  ABC  ( AB = AC ) if the common points  I, M, H  of bisectors, medians and altitudes respectively are given.","output":"1. **Identify the given points and their properties:**    - ( I ) is the incenter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ).    - ( M ) is the centroid of the triangle ( triangle ABC ).    - ( H ) is the orthocenter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Use Euler's theorem:**    Euler's theorem states that in any triangle, the orthocenter ( H ), the centroid ( M ), and the circumcenter ( O ) are collinear, and the distance between the centroid and the orthocenter is twice the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter:    [    OH = 3OM    ]    Given ( H ) and ( M ), we can find ( O ) using the relation:    [    O = M + frac{1}{3}(H - M)    ] 3. **Find the excenter ( I_A ):**    The excenter ( I_A ) opposite to vertex ( A ) can be found using the properties of the triangle.

When n=2, we have frac{a_2+2}{2} = 2sqrt{S_2}, S_2 = a_1 + a_2, substituting a_1 = 2 into it, we get (a_2 - 2)^2 = 16, since a_2 > 0, solving this gives a_2 = 6.

Hence, (tan a = 0) is indeed a solution as it keeps both (tan a) and (tan 3a) as integers. 2. **Using the triple angle formula for tangent:**    We know the formula for the tangent of a triple angle:    [    tan 3a = frac{3 tan a - tan^3 a}{1 - 3 tan^2 a}    ] 3. **Considering (tan a neq 0):**    Let's assume (tan a neq 0).

We need to show that ( frac{1}{2} < t < 2 ). 3. **Use the property of medians:**    The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Given that the medians from ( A ) to ( BC ) and from ( B ) to ( AC ) are perpendicular, we can use the Apollonius's theorem which states:    [    AB^2 + AC^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2    ]    where ( D ) is the midpoint of ( BC ). 4. **Apply the Apollonius's theorem:**    Since ( D ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), we have:    [    AD^2 = left(frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}right)    ]    and similarly for the median from ( B ) to ( AC ):    [    BE^2 = left(frac{2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4}right)    ]    where ( E ) is the midpoint of ( AC ). 5. **Use the perpendicularity condition:**    Since the medians are perpendicular, we have:    [    AD cdot BE = 0    ]    This implies:    [    left(frac{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}{4}right) cdot left(frac{2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2}{4}right) = 0    ] 6. **Simplify the equation:**    [    (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)(2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2) = 0    ]    This implies:    [    4b^2c^2 + 4c^4 - 2a^2c^2 - a^2b^2 = 0    ]    and    [    4a^2c^2 + 4c^4 - 2b^2c^2 - b^2a^2 = 0    ] 7. **Combine and solve the inequalities:**    From the above equations, we can derive:    [    a^2 + b^2 = 5c^2    ]    Using the triangle inequality, we have:    [    a^2 + b^2 > (a - b)^2    ]    Substituting ( a^2 + b^2 = 5c^2 ):    [    5c^2 > (a - b)^2    ]    This implies:    [    5c^2 > a^2 - 2ab + b^2    ]    Since ( a^2 + b^2 = 5c^2 ), we get:    [    5c^2 > 5c^2 - 2ab    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    2ab > 0    ]    Dividing by ( a^2 ), we get:    [    2t^2 - 5t + 2 < 0    ]    Solving the quadratic inequality:    [    t = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = frac{5 pm 3}{4}    ]    Thus, the roots are:    [    t = 2 quad text{and} quad t = frac{1}{2}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{1}{2} < t < 2    ] The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{1}{2} < frac{|AC|}{|BC|} < 2 } )"},{"instruction":"2022, Mr. and Mrs. Xiao Li opened a steamed bun shop.

We are interested in the probability of the daily sales being between 950 and 1100. This range can be broken down into two parts: from 950 to 1050 and from 1050 to 1100. The probability for the range from 950 to 1050 is already given as 0.6827. The range from 1050 to 1100 is half of the range from 900 to 1100, minus the range from 950 to 1050.

Since the circle is tangent to the line (x-y+1=0), the distance, (d), from the center of the circle ((2, b)) to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to a line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by the formula  d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.  Using this formula, we have sqrt{(2-1)^2+b^2} = frac{|2-b+1|}{sqrt{2}}.  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get (2-1)^2 + b^2 = frac{(2-b+1)^2}{2}, which simplifies to 1 + b^2 = frac{(3-b)^2}{2}.  Expanding the squares, we obtain 1 + b^2 = frac{9 - 6b + b^2}{2}.  Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get 2 + 2b^2 = 9 - 6b + b^2,  which simplifies to b^2 + 6b - 7 = 0.  Solving this quadratic equation for (b), we get two solutions: (b = 1) or (b = -7). Since (b) must be positive (the center is in the first quadrant), we discard (b = -7) and have (b = 1). Therefore, the center of circle (C) is (C(2,1)), and the radius (r) is equal to r = sqrt{(2-1)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}.

Parsley: - Started with 1 parsley plant. - Grows steadily with one new plant each week, so after six weeks, there would be 1 + 6 = 7 parsley plants. - However, in the fifth week, caterpillars devoured two of the parsley plants, so 7 - 2 = 5 parsley plants. 3.

Notice that ( m_A ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( PD ), so ( omega_A ) is symmetric with respect to ( m_A ). Since ( A ) and ( A_1 ) are also symmetric to each other in ( m_A ), the point ( A_1 ) lies on ( omega_A ). Similarly, ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) lie on ( omega_B ) and ( omega_C ), respectively.    Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). Quadrilaterals ( ABA_1B_1 ) and ( BCB_1C_1 ) are cyclic, so ( AH cdot HA_1 = BH cdot HB_1 = CH cdot HC_1 ).

Therefore,    [    begin{aligned}    &angle(PQ_A, PQ_B) - angle(PQQ_A, PA) + angle(PA, PB) + angle(PB, PQ_B)     &= angle(BC, PQ) + 90^circ + angle(CA, CB) + angle(PQ, CA) + 90^circ,    end{aligned}    ]    and this shows that ( P ), ( Q_A ), and ( Q_B ) are collinear. Similarly, ( Q_C ) also lies on the line determined by ( P ) and ( Q_A ). 3. Additional Comments:    There are several variations of Step 2. In particular, let ( O_A ), ( O_B ), and ( O_C ) denote the centers of ( omega_A ), ( omega_B ), and ( omega_C ), respectively; they lie on ( p_A ), ( p_B ), and ( p_C ), respectively. Moreover, all those centers lie on the perpendicular bisector ( p ) of ( PQ ). Now one can show that ( angle(QO_A, p_A) = angle(QO_B, p_B) = angle(QO_C, p_C) ), and then finish by applying the generalized Simson's theorem. Alternatively, but equivalently, those relations show that ( Q ) is the Miquel point of the lines ( p_A ), ( p_B ), ( p_C ), and ( p ).    To establish ( angle(QO_A, p_A) = angle(QO_C, p_C) ), notice that it is equivalent to ( angle(QO_A, QO_C) = angle(p_A, p_C) ). This can be obtained as follows:    [    begin{array}{l}    angle(QO_A, QO_C) = angle(QO_A, p) + angle(p, QO_C) = angle(AQ, AP) + angle(CP, CQ)     = angle(AQ, CQ) + angle(CP, AP) = angle(AQ, PQ) + angle(PQ, CQ) + angle(CB, AB)     = angle(AD, AA_1) + angle(CC_1, CF) + angle(AA_1, CC_1) = angle(AD, CF) = angle(p_A, p_C).    end{array}    ] In conclusion: [ boxed{text{The circles } omega_A, omega_B, omega_C, text{ and } omega text{ have a common point.}} ]"},{"instruction":"an 8 times 5 grid of lattice points, where each point is one unit away from its nearest neighbors horizontally and vertically, consider the following points: A(0, 4), B(7, 0), C(5, 3), and D(3, 0).

Consequently, angle DHC = 180^circ - angle HDC - angle HCD = 180^circ - (90^circ + 30^circ) - 40^circ = 20^circ. 5. **Conclusion**: Thus, angle DHC = 20^circ. boxed{The final answer is (C) 20°.}"},{"instruction":"A round table has a radius of 5.

We start by analyzing the function p(k) and X(k). 1. **Understanding p(k) and X(k)**:    - p(k) is the smallest prime not dividing k.    - X(k) is the product of all primes less than p(k), or 1 if p(k) = 2. 2. **Base Case**:    - x_0 = 1.    - p(1) = 2 (since 2 is the smallest prime and does not divide 1).    - X(1) = 1 (since p(1) = 2).    - Thus, x_1 = x_0 cdot p(x_0) / X(x_0) = 1 cdot 2 / 1 = 2. 3. **Recursive Relation Analysis**:    - From x_{n+1} = x_n cdot p(x_n) / X(x_n), we observe that x_{n+1} is obtained by multiplying x_n by p(x_n) and dividing by the product of all primes less than p(x_n). 4. **Lemma Verification**:    - The lemma states that x_{n+2^{k-1}} = P_k cdot x_n for all 0 leq n leq 2^{k-1} - 1.    - We verify this by induction:      - **Base Case**: For k=1, P_1 = 2, and x_{2^{1-1}} = x_1 = 2 = P_1 cdot x_0.      - **Inductive Step**: Assume true for k, prove for k+1.        - By assumption, x_{2^{k-1}} = P_k cdot x_0.        - p(x_{2^{k-1}}) = P_{k+1} (since all smaller primes divide x_{2^{k-1}}).        - X(x_{2^{k-1}}) = prod_{j=1}^k P_j.        - Thus, x_{2^{k-1}+1} = x_{2^{k-1}} cdot P_{k+1} / prod_{j=1}^k P_j = P_{k+1}.        - This pattern repeats, confirming the lemma. 5. **Finding t such that x_t = 2090**:    - Factorize 2090 = 2 cdot 5 cdot 11 cdot 19 = P_1 cdot P_3 cdot P_5 cdot P_8.    - Using the lemma, the smallest n such that 19 | x_n is 2^7.    - By applying the lemma recursively, t = 2^7 + 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 128 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 149.

Please find the most costeffective purchasing plan and the minimum total purchase amount in yuan.","output":"# Solution:  Part 1: Finding the Tons of Goods Transported by Each Robot Let's denote the amount of goods transported per day by each A robot as x tons. Consequently, each B robot transports x + 10 tons per day. Given that the number of A robots needed to transport 540 tons per day is the same as the number of B robots needed to transport 600 tons per day, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{540}{x} = frac{600}{x + 10} ] Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows: [ 540(x + 10) = 600x  540x + 5400 = 600x  600x - 540x = 5400  60x = 5400  x = 90 ] Thus, each A robot transports 90 tons of goods per day. For each B robot, the amount is x + 10 = 90 + 10 = 100 tons per day. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is: - Each A robot transports boxed{90} tons of goods per day. - Each B robot transports boxed{100} tons of goods per day.  Part 2: Finding the Most Cost-Effective Purchasing Plan Let m represent the number of A robots purchased. The total purchase amount in yuan is denoted as w.

The total purchase amount w can be calculated as: [ w = 1.2m + 2(30 - m) = -0.8m + 60 ] Since the coefficient of m in the expression for w is negative (-0.8 < 0), w decreases as m increases. Therefore, to minimize w, we choose the maximum value of m within the allowable range, which is m = 17. Substituting m = 17 into the expression for w, we get: [ w = -0.8 times 17 + 60 = 46.4 ] Thus, the minimum total purchase amount is 46.4 thousand yuan when purchasing 17 A robots and 13 B robots.

Prove that if  N  is coprime with  m1,n1,m+n1  then any initial arrangement of your elements in the table cells can become any other arrangement using an finite quantity of moves.","output":"1. **Lemma Application**: We start by applying the lemma to the problem. Let ( B = M_{m times n}(mathbb{Z}_N) ), the additive group of all ( m times n ) matrices with coefficients in (mathbb{Z}_N), which we identify with (mathbb{Z}_N^{mn}). For any ( 1 leq i leq m ) and ( 1 leq j leq n ), we write ( u_{ij} ) for the matrix whose ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column are all equal to 1, and all other entries are zero. We take ( A ) to be the subgroup of ( B ) generated by all the matrices ( u_{ij} ). We want to show that ( A = B ). 2. **Reduction to Prime Case**: The lemma tells us that it suffices to prove the case where ( N = p ) is a prime number. Under this assumption, we have (mathbb{Z}_N = mathbb{F}_p) is a field. Thus ( B = M_{m times n}(mathbb{F}_p) ) is an (mathbb{F}_p)-vector space, which we equip with a nondegenerate bilinear form (langle (a_{ij})_{ij}, (b_{ij})_{ij} rangle = sum_{ij} a_{ij} b_{ij} ). 3. **Orthogonal Complement**: To show that ( A = B ), it suffices to show that the orthogonal complement of ( A ) is zero. Let ( a = (a_{ij})_{ij} ) be a matrix that is in the orthogonal complement of ( A ). This is equivalent to saying that (langle a, u_{ij} rangle = 0) for any ( i, j ). 4. **Row and Column Sums**: For any ( i, j ), we write ( r_i ) for the sum (sum_j a_{ij}) and ( c_j ) for the sum (sum_i a_{ij}). The definition of ( u_{ij} ) then gives (langle a, u_{ij} rangle = r_i + c_j - a_{ij} ). Therefore, we have ( a_{ij} = r_i + c_j ) for any ( i, j ). 5. **Summing Over Rows and Columns**: Summing up for all ( j ), we get ( r_i = sum_j (r_i + c_j) = n r_i + s ) where we write ( s = sum_i r_i = sum_j c_j = sum_{ij} a_{ij} ). This gives ((n - 1) r_i = -s). Since ( n - 1 ) is invertible in (mathbb{F}_p), we see that all ( r_i ) are equal. Similarly, summing up for all ( i ) gives us ((m - 1) c_j = -s), which implies that all ( c_j ) are equal. Consequently, all ( a_{ij} ) are equal to a constant ( x in mathbb{F}_p ). 6. **Final Step**: Thus ( r_i = n x ) and ( c_j = m x ), and the identity ( a_{ij} = r_i + c_j ) becomes ((m + n - 1) x = 0), from which we conclude ( x = 0 ) as ( m + n - 1 ) is invertible in (mathbb{F}_p). We have shown that any matrix in the orthogonal complement of ( A ) is equal to 0, thus ( A = B ).

Price after regular discount = (P times (1 - d_1)) Price after 30% regular discount = (30 times (1 - 0.30)) Price after 30% regular discount = (30 times 0.70) Price after 30% regular discount = 21.00 Now, we know that after the additional discount, the price becomes 16.80.

Since Pipe B can fill the tank 3 times as fast as Pipe A, it would take Pipe B ( frac{t}{3} ) minutes to fill the tank alone. When both pipes are working together, their combined rate of filling the tank is the sum of their individual rates. The rate at which a pipe fills a tank is the reciprocal of the time it takes to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{t} + frac{3}{t} = frac{4}{t} ). We know that when both pipes are open, it takes 3 minutes to fill the tank. This means that the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the tank per minute.

The move allows us to choose any cell containing (-1), replace it with (0), and simultaneously multiply all the numbers in the neighboring cells by (-1). 1. **Initial Setup and Move Description**:    - Initially, the table has one (-1) and all other entries are (+1).    - A move consists of selecting a cell with (-1), changing it to (0), and flipping the signs of all its neighboring cells (cells sharing a common side). 2. **Effect of a Move**:    - When a (-1) is changed to (0), the neighboring cells' signs are flipped.    - This means that if a neighboring cell was (+1), it becomes (-1), and if it was (-1), it becomes (+1). 3. **Parity Consideration**:    - We need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of (-1)s in the table.    - Initially, there is exactly one (-1), which is odd.    - Each move changes the number of (-1)s by an even number (since flipping the signs of an even number of cells changes the parity of the number of (-1)s). 4. **Final Configuration**:    - To achieve a table of all zeros, the number of (-1)s must be zero, which is even.    - Therefore, the number of (-1)s must change from odd to even, which is only possible if the total number of cells in the table is even. 5. **Condition for (m) and (n)**:    - The total number of cells in the table is (m times n).    - For the number of (-1)s to change from odd to even, (m times n) must be even.    - This implies that either (m) or (n) must be even (or both). 6. **Double Counting Argument**:    - Consider the parity of the number of (-1)s in the table after each move.    - If (m) and (n) are both odd, then ((m-1)(n-1)) is even, and the parity of the number of (-1)s can be changed to even.    - If either (m) or (n) is even, then ((m-1)(n-1)) is odd, and the parity of the number of (-1)s cannot be changed to even.

Also, the vertex coordinates of the function f(x) are (x0, -3),    so f(-2) = 4a - 8a + 1 = -3,    solving for a, we get a = 1.    Therefore, the analytical expression of f(x) is f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 1.    Hence, the answer is boxed{f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 1}. 2.

Squaring both sides, we have:    [    (ab)^2 = (cm)^2    ]    Therefore,    [    a^2 b^2 = c^2 m^2    ]     4. Knowing that in a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, Pythagoras' theorem gives us:    [    c^2 = a^2 + b^2    ]    So substituting this, we get:    [    m^2 = frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2 + b^2}    ]     5. According to the problem, the triangle formed by the altitudes of the original right triangle is also a right triangle. Therefore, applying the Pythagorean theorem to these altitudes,    [    a^2 + m^2 = b^2    ] 6. Substitute the expression for m^2:    [    a^2 + frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2 + b^2} = b^2    ] 7. To clear the fraction, multiply every term by (a^2 + b^2):    [    a^2(a^2 + b^2) + a^2 b^2 = b^2 (a^2 + b^2)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    a^4 + a^2 b^2 + a^2 b^2 = b^4 + b^2 a^2    ]    Which simplifies to:    [    a^4 + 2a^2b^2 = b^4 + b^2 a^2    ]     8. Collecting like terms gives:    [    a^4 - b^4 + a^2 b^2 = 0    ] 9. Assume a^2 = x and b^2 = y, then we have:    [    x^2 - y^2 + xy = 0    ]    Simplifying,    [    frac{x}{y} - frac{y}{x} + 1 = 0    ]    Let r = frac{x}{y},    [    r - frac{1}{r} + 1 = 0    ] 10. Multiplying the entire equation by r to clear the fraction:     [     r^2 - 1 + r = 0     ]     which simplifies to:     [     r^2 + r - 1 = 0     ] 11. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:     [     r = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}     ]     Here, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -1:     [     r = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2}     ] 12. Since r = frac{a^2}{b^2} must be positive:     [     r = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2}     ]      13. Therefore,     [     frac{a^2}{b^2} = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2}     ]     Taking the square root of both sides,     [     frac{a}{b} = sqrt{frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2}}     ] 14.

Recall that the area of a parallelogram is given by:    [    text{Area of } ABCD = AB cdot h    ]    where (h) is the height from the base (AB) to (CD). 4.

The triangles (ABC) and (ABE) are isosceles with the base angles ( frac{180^circ - 54^circ}{2} = 63^circ ), making each angle at (A) ( 63^circ ) and each angle at (B) and (E) also ( 63^circ ).

In a regular pentagon, the ratio of the diagonal to the side can be derived from pentagonal properties and equals ( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) (a known result involving the golden ratio, (phi)), but here we need the cosine rule to determine lengths: [ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BC cdot cos(108^circ) ] Since (AB = BC), this simplifies to: [ AC = AB sqrt{2(1 - cos(108^circ))} ] Using the approximate value (cos(108^circ) = -cos(72^circ) = -frac{sqrt{5}+1}{4}), we have: [ AC approx AB sqrt{2(1 + frac{sqrt{5}+1}{4})} = AB sqrt{frac{6 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ] Thus, the ratio between (AC) and (AB) is: [ frac{AC}{AB} = sqrt{frac{6 + sqrt{5}}{2}} ] (boxed{sqrt{frac{6 + sqrt{5}}{2}}}).

To maximize this expression, we can use the fact that sin(theta + frac{pi}{3}) achieves its maximum value at theta = frac{pi}{6}, thus: sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{3}right) = sinthetacosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) + costhetasinleft(frac{pi}{3}right). Using cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2} and sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we have: begin{align*} 2sintheta + 2sqrt{3}costheta &= 2sintheta + 3costheta  &= 4sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{3}right). end{align*} Therefore, the square of the magnitude is: |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 4sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{3}right) + 5. The maximum of sinleft(theta + frac{pi}{3}right) is 1, so we have the maximum value of |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}|^2 as: |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 4 cdot 1 + 5 = 9. Taking the square root yields the maximum value of the magnitude: boxed{|overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}| = 3}."},{"instruction":"Brenda starts with 7 Skittles. She buys 8 more.

The number of ways to arrange 7 different digits is:      [      7!      ]    - Therefore, the total number of sequences with exactly 7 different digits is:      [      binom{10}{7} times 7!      ] 4. **Calculate the probability of having at most 5 different digits:**    - The total number of sequences with at most 5 different digits is the total number of sequences minus the number of sequences with 6 different digits and the number of sequences with 7 different digits.    - The probability of having at most 5 different digits is:      [      P(text{at most 5 different digits}) = 1 - left( frac{binom{10}{6} times 6 times frac{7!}{2!}}{10^7} + frac{binom{10}{7} times 7!}{10^7} right)      ] 5. **Simplify the expression:**    - Calculate the binomial coefficients and factorials:      [      binom{10}{6} = 210, quad binom{10}{7} = 120      ]      [      7! = 5040, quad frac{7!}{2!} = frac{5040}{2} = 2520      ]    - Substitute these values into the expression:      [      P(text{at most 5 different digits}) = 1 - left( frac{210 times 6 times 2520}{10^7} + frac{120 times 5040}{10^7} right)      ]      [      = 1 - left( frac{3175200}{10^7} + frac{604800}{10^7} right)      ]      [      = 1 - left( 0.31752 + 0.06048 right)      ]      [      = 1 - 0.378      ]      [      = 0.622      ] The final answer is (boxed{0.622})"},{"instruction":"f the even function f(x), for x in mathbb{R}^{+}, satisfies f'(x) > frac{f(x)}{x} and f(1)=0, then the solution set of the inequality frac{f(x)}{x} geqslant 0 is __________.","output":"Let g(x)= frac{f(x)}{x}, then g'(x)= frac{xf'(x)-f(x)}{x^{2}}.

Given that Anne can clean the house on her own in 12 hours, her rate A is 1/12 houses per hour. When Bruce and Anne work together at their current rates, they can clean the house in 4 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/4 houses per hour. So we have the equation: B + A = 1/4 Substituting Anne's rate into the equation, we get: B + 1/12 = 1/4 To find Bruce's rate B, we solve for B: B = 1/4 - 1/12 B = 3/12 - 1/12 B = 2/12 B = 1/6 houses per hour Now, if Anne's speed were doubled, her new rate would be 2A, which is 2 * 1/12 = 1/6 houses per hour.

We start by noting that B D is a diagonal of the raised hexagon and that its true magnitude is the actual distance between points B and D in three-dimensional space. 2. The problem states that the first projection of B D is half its actual length. Therefore, let's denote the first projection of B D as B D'. According to the problem, B D' is frac{1}{2} B D.     3. To solve this, we will transform the hexagon into a new coordinate plane which is perpendicular to both the original plane and to the line segment C F. When this transformation is completed, the hexagon will appear as a straight line in its third projection. 4. From point D', drop a perpendicular line to the line t_{13}, which represents the new transformed axes. Using a compass and length equivalent to the original B D, draw an arc from point A''' which intersects this perpendicular line. 5. Since the angle formed by the hexagon in its new orientation is 60 degrees (as it's a regular hexagon), let's denote this angle by alpha. From the given conditions, it follows that the angle alpha must be 60^circ. Conclusion: [ alpha = 60^circ ] Therefore, the first inclination angle of the raised hexagon plane is (boxed{60^circ}). # Second Solution 1. The problem states that the first projection of the diagonal B D is half its actual length, implying that B D' is frac{B D}{2}. 2. We know that B D forms the hypotenuse of a 60 degree right triangle. Let's denote this triangle as triangle B D P, where P lies directly below or above point D. 3. In a 60^circ right triangle, the smaller leg (opposite the 30^circ) is half the hypotenuse. Thus, one of the legs of our triangle is frac{B D}{2}, which corresponds to the projection.     4. The other leg will be frac{B D}{2} sqrt{3} since  tan(60^circ) = sqrt{3}, and thus the second leg equals ( frac{B D}{2} cdot sqrt{3} ), representing the projection for point D. 5. Using these measurements, the two projections for point D can be derived, and hence the points for E can be found as well. Bringing in the projections for points C and F, which will lie on a parallel line to A B and A'B', can similarly be constructed through their respective distances. 6. The second projection of these points will be aligned parallel to A'' B'' and D'' E'' situated halfway across, maintaining the necessary distance and angle constraints. Conclusion: [ alpha = 60^circ ] Therefore, the first inclination angle boxed{60^circ} follows from the second projection analysis."},{"instruction":"Two trains 140 m and 160 m long run at the speed of 60 km/hr and at certain speed respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks.

Since the parabola is given by y^{2}=4cx, F' is the focus of the parabola. Since O is the midpoint of FF', and vec{OE}= frac {1}{2}( vec{OF}+ vec{OP}), it follows that E is the midpoint of FP.

Let     [    a = overrightarrow{MA}, quad b = overrightarrow{MB}, quad c = overrightarrow{MC}.    ] 2. **Use Known Inequality with Positive Reals:**    We aim to use the inequality which states that if x, y, z are positive reals such that    [    xy + yz + zx geqslant 1,    ]    then    [    x + y + z geqslant sqrt{3}.    ]    To apply this, we need to show:    [    sum frac{MA cdot MB}{BC cdot CA} geqslant 1.    ] 3. **Translate into Complex Terms:**   We translate the problem into the complex plane. Suppose that    [   a = overrightarrow{MA}, quad b = overrightarrow{MB}, quad c = overrightarrow{MC}.   ] 4. **Set Inequality in Complex Terms:**    The task simplifies to showing:    [    left| sum frac{ab}{(b-c)(c-a)} right| geqslant 1.    ] 5. **Use Symmetry and Algebraic Manipulation:**    We need to compute:    [    sum frac{ab(a-b)}{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}.    ]    Since    [    sum frac{ab}{(b-c)(c-a)} = -1,    ]    simplifies to a standard identity when concerning complex numbers positions and magnitudes inherent in a plane geometry. 6. **Apply Triangular Inequality:**    By the triangular inequality in complex algebra, we get:    [    left| -1 right| = 1.    ] So, from the steps, we can conclude that: [ frac{MA}{BC} + frac{MB}{CA} + frac{MC}{AB} geqslant sqrt{3}. ] Thus, the solution is complete, and we have successfully shown the desired inequality.

Determine the number of positive integers  2leq nleq 50  such that all coefficients of the polynomial [ left(x^{varphi(n)}  1right)  prod_{substack{1leq kleq ngcd(k,n) = 1}}(xk) ] are divisible by  n .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to determine the number of positive integers (2 leq n leq 50) such that all coefficients of the polynomial    [    left(x^{varphi(n)} - 1right) - prod_{substack{1 leq k leq n  gcd(k, n) = 1}} (x - k)    ]    are divisible by (n). Here, (varphi(n)) denotes Euler's totient function, which counts the number of positive integers up to (n) that are relatively prime to (n). 2. **Classifying (n) with the Property:**    We need to classify all (n) that satisfy the given property. It is known that (n) satisfies the property if and only if it is a prime, 4, or twice a Fermat prime. 3. **Checking Primes:**    For a prime (n), (varphi(n) = n - 1). The polynomial becomes:    [    x^{n-1} - 1 - prod_{1 leq k leq n-1} (x - k)    ]    Since (prod_{1 leq k leq n-1} (x - k) = x^{n-1} - 1), the expression simplifies to 0, and all coefficients are trivially divisible by (n). 4. **Checking (n = 4):**    For (n = 4), (varphi(4) = 2). The polynomial becomes:    [    x^2 - 1 - prod_{substack{1 leq k leq 4  gcd(k, 4) = 1}} (x - k) = x^2 - 1 - (x - 1)(x - 3)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x^2 - 1 - (x^2 - 4x + 3) = 4x - 4    ]    All coefficients (4 and -4) are divisible by 4. 5. **Checking (n = 2p) where (p) is a Fermat Prime:**    Fermat primes are of the form (2^{2^m} + 1). Known Fermat primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. For (n = 2p), (varphi(n) = varphi(2) varphi(p) = 1 cdot (p-1) = p-1). The polynomial becomes:    [    x^{p-1} - 1 - prod_{substack{1 leq k leq 2p  gcd(k, 2p) = 1}} (x - k)    ]    Since (p-1) is a power of 2, the polynomial modulo 2 simplifies to:    [    (x - 1)^{p-1} equiv x^{p-1} - 1 pmod{2}    ]    and modulo (p):    [    prod_{1 leq k leq p-1} (x - k) equiv x^{p-1} - 1 pmod{p}    ]    Thus, all coefficients are divisible by (2p). 6. **Proving the Necessary Condition:**    Suppose (n) satisfies the condition. Let (p) be a prime divisor of (n). Then:    [    prod_{substack{1 leq k leq n  gcd(k, n) = 1}} (x - k) equiv prod_{1 leq k leq p-1} (x - k)^{frac{varphi(n)}{p-1}} equiv (x^{p-1} - 1)^{frac{varphi(n)}{p-1}} pmod{p}    ]    This must equal (x^{varphi(n)} - 1). This only happens when (frac{varphi(n)}{p-1}) is a power of (p). 7. **Eliminating Non-Prime Powers:**    If (n) is not a prime power, then (n) is twice a Fermat prime. Suppose (p > q) are two distinct primes dividing (n). Then ((p-1)(q-1) mid varphi(n)), so:    - (q-1) is a power of (p),    - (p-1) is a power of (q).    Since (q-1 < p), (q-1 = 1) and (q = 2). Thus, (p = 2^s + 1) for some (s). This shows that 2 and (2^s + 1) are the only prime factors of (n), so (n = 2^e (2^s + 1)^f). Then (varphi(n) = 2^{e+s-1} (2^s + 1)^{f-1}). This must be a power of 2, so (f = 1). It must also be (2^s) times a power of (2^s + 1), so (e+s-1 = s), hence (e = 1). Thus, (n = 2(2^s + 1)). 8. **Dealing with Prime Powers:**    For (n = p^e) with (e geq 2), we require:    [    x^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 equiv prod_{substack{1 leq k leq p^e  p nmid k}} (x - k) pmod{n}    ]    Setting (x mapsto x-1):    [    (x-1)^{p^{e-1}(p-1)} - 1 equiv prod_{substack{1 leq k leq p^e  p nmid k-1}} (x - k) pmod{n}    ]    If (e neq 2), the RHS contains three distinct factors (x), (x-p), (x-p^{e-1}), which collectively contain a factor of (x^2). Thus, (e = 2). If (p neq 2), the RHS contains three distinct factors (x), (x-p), (x-2p), which multiply to a product divisible by (x^2). Thus, ((p, e) = (2, 2)), so (n = 2^2 = 4).

Consider an (8 times 8) chessboard where each cell represents a lamp:     - A lamp being \\"on\\" is represented by (1).     - A lamp being \\"off\\" is represented by (-1). 2. Initially, all lamps are \\"on\\" (i.e., represented by (1)), except for the fourth lamp in the first row, which is \\"off\\" (represented by (-1)). 3. Every operation allows us to invert the values (i.e., change (1) to (-1) and (-1) to (1)) along:    - An entire row    - An entire column    - A diagonal or any line parallel to a diagonal, including single-cell diagonals at the corners. 4. We need to determine whether it is possible to turn all the lamps \\"off\\" (i.e., all cells showing (-1)) making use of these operations. 5. We define a mathematical invariant property that can help us to solve the problem. Let's use the product of the lamps' values along the border of the board, excluding the four corners, as our invariant. 6. For an (8 times 8) board, the border consists of:     - First row: (8 - 4 = 4) cells (excluding the corners)     - Last row: (8 - 4 = 4) cells (excluding the corners)     - First column: (8 - 4 = 4) cells (excluding the corners)     - Last column: (8 - 4 = 4) cells (excluding the corners)         This gives us a total of (20) border cells (8 on each side minus 2 for each corner, which is 4 corners). 7.

Now, consider the effect of any valid operation (inverting all values on any row, column, or diagonal). Each such operation changes the sign of an even number of lamps (either all in a line). Since the number of lamps involved is always even, the product of their values before the operation and after will be the same because:     [     (-a_1) times (-a_2) times (-a_3) times dots times (-a_{n}) = a_1 times a_2 times a_3 times dots times a_{n}     ]     This implies that the product of the values of the lamps always remains invariant and must still be (-1). 9.

The formula for the average is: Average = Total Sales / Number of Months We are given that the average sale needs to be Rs. 6500 over 6 months, so we can set up the equation: 6500 = Total Sales / 6 Now we solve for Total Sales: Total Sales = 6500 * 6 Total Sales = 39000 We are given the sales for the other 4 months and the required sale for the sixth month: Sales for other 4 months = Rs. 6335 + Rs. 6927 + Rs. 6855 + Rs. 6562 Sales for other 4 months = Rs. 26679 Required sale for the sixth month = Rs. 5091 Now we subtract the sales of the other 4 months and the required sale for the sixth month from the Total Sales to find the sale in the fourth month: Sale in the fourth month = Total Sales - (Sales for other 4 months + Required sale for the sixth month) Sale in the fourth month = 39000 - (26679 + 5091) Sale in the fourth month = 39000 - 31770 Sale in the fourth month = Rs. 7230 Therefore, the sale in the fourth month was Rs. boxed{7230} ."},{"instruction":"( ( a + b ) / c ) / 2 in the expression above , a , b , and c are different numbers and each is one of the numbers 2 , 3 , or 5 . what is the least possible value of the expression ?","output":"To find the least possible value of the expression (frac{frac{a + b}{c}}{2}), we need to minimize the numerator (a + b) and maximize the denominator (c).

The internal angle bisector from vertex (A). 2. The midline parallel to side (AB). 3. The line through the points where the incircle touches the sides originating from (B). To begin, we'll define the notations and setup required for the proof. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define Points of Tangency**    Let the incircle of triangle (ABC) touch (BC) at (A_1) and (BA) at (C_1).  2. **Define Midpoints**    Let (A_0) be the midpoint of side (BC) and (B_0) be the midpoint of side (AC). 3. **Intersection Point**    Let (N) be the intersection point of line (A_1C_1) with line (A_0B_0). 4. **Line (PC) and Similar Triangles**    Consider the line through (C) parallel to (AB) that intersects (A_1C_1) at point (P). Since (PCA_1) and (C_1BA_1) are centrally similar triangles centered at (A_1):         [     frac{P C}{A_1 C} = frac{C_1 B}{A_1 B}     ]        From the known relationship of tangents to a circle, we have (A_1 B = C_1 B = s - BC) (where (s) is the semiperimeter). 5. **Calculate Lengths Using Perimeter Relations**    We thus have:        [    PC = A_1 C = s - AB    ]        Since:        [    s = frac{AB + BC + CA}{2}    ]     6. **Trapezoids and Midpoint Theorem**    Next, considering the trapezoid (P CAC_1), by midpoint theorem:        [    N B_0 = frac{1}{2} (AC_1 + PC) = frac{(s - BC) + (s - AB)}{2} = frac{2s - (BC + AB)}{2} = frac{AC}{2}    ]        Thus, (NB_0 = AB_0). 7. **Isosceles Triangle**    Hence, (N A B_0) forms an isosceles triangle. This gives us the equality of the angles:        [    angle CA N = angle B_0 A N = angle B_0 NA = angle BAN    ]        This configuration implies that (AN) is the internal angle bisector from (A). 8. **Validation with Excircles**    We proceed similarly with excircles tangent externally to (BC) and the lines (AB) and (AC) at new points (A_2, C_2) respecting external tangents:        Define:        [    A_2C_2 text{ intersects } BC text{ similar to } C_2    ]        By central similarity and equal tangents, the excircles respect the previously established concurrency relation. 9. **Conclusions for All Circles**    By analyzing similarly with the other relevant excircles tangent to (AB) and (AC), the same concurrency holds by symmetry and central similarity.     # Conclusion Thus, we demonstrated that the concurrent lines meet at the point where the chosen circle's center lies.

The woman's train is moving at 20 kmph, and the goods train is moving at 51.99424046076314 kmph in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speeds are added together. Relative speed = Speed of woman's train + Speed of goods train Relative speed = 20 kmph + 51.99424046076314 kmph Relative speed = 71.99424046076314 kmph To calculate the time, we need the relative speed in meters per second. We convert kmph to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 h): Relative speed in m/s = 71.99424046076314 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) Relative speed in m/s = 71.99424046076314 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 71994.24046076314 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s ≈ 19.9984 m/s Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the goods train to pass the woman by dividing the length of the goods train by the relative speed: Time = Length of goods train / Relative speed Time = 300 m / 19.9984 m/s Time ≈ 15 seconds So, it takes approximately boxed{15}  seconds for the goods train to pass the woman."},{"instruction":"f [2011^{2011^{2012}} = x^x] for some positive integer  x , how many positive integer factors does  x  have? *Author: Alex Zhu*","output":"1.

Equating the exponents of ( 2011 ) on both sides, we get:    [    2011^{2012} = a cdot 2011^a    ] 6. To solve for ( a ), we observe that the exponents must match. Therefore, we set:    [    a cdot 2011^a = 2011^{2012}    ] 7. Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:    [    a cdot 2011^a = 2011^{2012}    ] 8.

Hence, the solution set for the inequality is A = {x | 1 leq x leq 3} = [1, 3]. Next, we analyze set B and its inequality: x^2 - ax < x - a. We can rewrite the inequality as: x^2 - (a + 1)x + a < 0. In the standard form of a quadratic equation, we have the factored form as: (x - 1)(x - a) < 0. To find the range of x where the inequality holds, we check the discriminant Delta, but since we already factored the equation, a discriminant is not necessary for this inequality. We proceed to analyze the intervals determining the sign of the product: When a = 1, we have B = emptyset (an empty set), which is a subset of any set, including A. When a < 1, the solution set is B = (a, 1), which does not satisfy A supseteq B as values less than 1 are not included in A. When a > 1, we have B = (1, a). For B to be a subset of A, we require a leq 3. Therefore, 1 < a leq 3. Combining these cases, we conclude that the range of values for a that meets the condition A supseteq B is 1 leq a leq 3.

That is, ( A_i cup A_j = mathrm{T} ). 2. **Examining the Union Condition:**    We observe that for any pair of subsets ( A_i ) and ( A_j ), ( A_i cup A_j ) must be the entire set ( mathrm{T} ). This implies that each element of ( mathrm{T} ) must appear in at least one of ( A_i ) or ( A_j ) for every pair ( (i, j) ). 3. **Counting Pairs of Subsets:**    Given any pair of numbers from the subsets, the subset union condition must hold. For maximum distinct subsets, we need to figure out how many such subsets can coexist while satisfying this condition. Each subset can be thought of as deciding whether each of the 999 elements in ( mathrm{T} ) is included in the subset or not. 4. **Key Observation:**    The number of distinct possible subsets of a set with 999 elements is ( 2^{999} ). However, we are interested in subsets that can pair up such that their union covers all 999 elements. 5. **Deriving the Maximum ( k ):**    To simultaneously satisfy the union condition for all pairs of subsets, we can consider a simplified scenario. If we have ( 1000 ) subsets, we can craft ( 999 ) subsets each missing exactly one distinct element of ( T ) and one subset being the empty set. This ensures that any pair of the subsets will have union ( T ), fulfilling the condition:    - ( A_1 ) missing element ( 1 )    - ( A_2 ) missing element ( 2 )    - ...    - ( A_{999} ) missing element ( 999 )    - One subset is empty.     6. **Conclusion:**    The maximum possible value of ( mathrm{k} ) such that for any ( i, j ) with ( 1 leq i < j leq k ), ( A_i cup A_j = mathrm{T} ), is hence found to be 1000.

Let g(x)=2-4x+ln x (x > 0), then g′(x)= dfrac {1-4x}{x}. Therefore, when 0 < x < dfrac {1}{4}, g′(x) > 0, and g(x) is increasing on (0, dfrac {1}{4}). When x > dfrac {1}{4}, g′(x) < 0, and g(x) is decreasing on ( dfrac {1}{4},+infty). Therefore, g(x)leqslant g( dfrac {1}{4})=1+ln dfrac {1}{4}=1-ln 4 < 0.

The side lengths of quadrilateral AB_1CD in the order of traversal are b, a, c, d respectively, maintaining the same sequence of sides as the original quadrilateral. 5. To prove the inequality involving the area S of the quadrilateral ABCD, we observe the inequality S leq frac{1}{2}(ac + bd) for the quadrilateral AB_1CD. 6. The equality associated with this inequality holds iff the angles angle DAB_1 = angle B_1CD = 90^circ. 7. This condition implies that quadrilateral AB_1CD is a circumscribed quadrilateral with two pairs of opposite right angles. 8. Therefore, if the equality angle DAB = angle BCD = 90^circ holds, then quadrilateral ABCD is also circumscribed around a circle with perpendicular diagonals. 9. Thus, the given inequality holds for any quadrilateral, with equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic with perpendicular diagonals.

First, let's calculate the length of OA. Since A is at (-1,0), the length of OA is simply the distance from the origin to A, which can be found using the distance formula or simply observing that it is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of A (since A is on the x-axis). Thus, OA = |-1| = 1. Given that BC = 4AO, we substitute the value of OA into this equation to find the length of BC: BC = 4 times OA = 4 times 1 = 4. Since BC is parallel to OA, and OA lies along the x-axis, BC must also be a horizontal line segment. This means the y-coordinate of B and C must be the same because horizontal lines have constant y-values. Given B(-3,-4), the y-coordinate of C is also -4. To find the x-coordinate of C, we consider two scenarios due to the vector direction of BC being parallel to OA: 1. C is to the left of B: Since BC = 4 and is a horizontal line, we subtract 4 units from the x-coordinate of B to find the x-coordinate of C: x_C = x_B - 4 = -3 - 4 = -7. Thus, one possible coordinate for C is (-7, -4). 2. C is to the right of B: Alternatively, if C is to the right of B, we add 4 units to the x-coordinate of B: x_C = x_B + 4 = -3 + 4 = 1. Thus, another possible coordinate for C is (1, -4). Therefore, the coordinates of point C are boxed{(-7, -4)} or boxed{(1, -4)}."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, AD bisects angle BAC with D on BC.

Each cell contains some number.     - You are allowed to change the sign of all the numbers in any row or any column.     - Therefore, you have at most 2^{mn} different possible configurations of the table.

This would increase the total sum of the table since -S_c > S_c when S_c is negative.     - This again contradicts the assumption that T already had the maximum possible total sum. 6. **Conclusion:**     - Thus, in the configuration T where the total sum of the table is maximal, the sum of the numbers in each row and each column must be non-negative.     - You can always reach such a configuration by repeatedly changing the signs of the numbers in certain rows or columns until all sums become non-negative.

Simple Interest: SI = P * 10 * 2 / 100 SI = P * 20 / 100 SI = P * 0.2 Compound Interest: CI = P * (1 + 10/100)^2 - P CI = P * (1 + 0.1)^2 - P CI = P * (1.1)^2 - P CI = P * 1.21 - P CI = P * 0.21 The difference between the compound interest and simple interest is given as 631: CI - SI = 631 P * 0.21 - P * 0.2 = 631 P * (0.21 - 0.2) = 631 P * 0.01 = 631 Now, we can solve for P: P = 631 / 0.01 P = 63100 Therefore, the principal sum is boxed{63,100} ."},{"instruction":"The approximate interval where the zero of the function f(x) = 2^x + 2x  3 is located is (　　)   A: (0, frac{1}{2})   B: (frac{1}{2}, 1)   C: (1, 2)   D: (2, 3)","output":"The function f(x) = 2^x + 2x - 3 is monotonically increasing and continuous over its domain mathbb{R},   f(frac{1}{2}) = sqrt{2} + 1 - 3 < 0,   f(1) = 2 + 2 - 3 = 1 > 0;   Therefore, f(frac{1}{2}) cdot f(1) < 0;   Hence, the zero of the function f(x) = 2^x + 2x - 3 is approximately located in the interval (frac{1}{2}, 1).

If none of these trees are pines (S), then the trees must alternate between poplars (T) and birches (B).     - However, in such a case, two consecutive birches (B) would only be separated by one other tree, which contradicts the spacing constraint that requires at least two trees between two birches (B). 3. **Ensuring presence of at least one pine (S) in any group of four trees**:    - Thus, in any group of four consecutive trees, there must be at least one pine (S). 4. **Ensuring at most one pine (S) in any group of four trees**:    - Also, in any group of four consecutive trees, there cannot be more than one pine (S). Otherwise, the distance between any two pines (S) would be less than three trees, which contradicts the given constraint. 5. **Forming groups and calculating the number of pines (S)**:    - Divide the row of trees into groups of four consecutive trees:  lfloor 101 / 4 rfloor groups of 4 trees each = 25 groups and 1 extra tree.    - Each group of four must contain exactly one pine (S).

(2) If player A is leading with a score of 6:2, let X represent the number of games left to finish the game.

There are {C}_{5}^{4} ways to arrange these outcomes, and the probability of each sequence is left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 times left(frac{2}{3}right) times left(frac{1}{3}right), because the final game must be a win for player A. Therefore, the probability of this happening is:   [   {C}_{5}^{4}left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 left(frac{2}{3}right)left(frac{1}{3}right) = 5cdotleft(frac{1}{3}right)^5left(frac{2}{3}right) = frac{10}{729}   ] - If player B wins, the sequence before the final win must be LLLLW (in any order), with a similar calculation involving player B's probability to win. The probability of this happening is:   [   {C}_{5}^{4}left(frac{2}{3}right)^4 left(frac{1}{3}right)left(frac{2}{3}right) = 5cdotleft(frac{2}{3}right)^5left(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{160}{729}   ] Therefore, the total probability P(A) that exactly 6 games are played is: [ P(A) = frac{10}{729} + frac{160}{729} = frac{170}{729} ] Thus, the probability of exactly 6 games being played before the game ends is boxed{frac{170}{729}}.  Part (2) For the scenario where player A is leading with a score of 6:2, let's find the probability distribution and the expected value of X, the number of games left to finish the game. The possible values of X are 2, 3, 4, 5. - P(X=2) occurs if player A wins the next two games straight, so:   [   P(X=2) = left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 = frac{1}{9}   ] - P(X=3) occurs if there's one win for each player in the next two games (in any order), then player A wins the third, so:   [   P(X=3) = {C}_{2}^{1}left(frac{1}{3}right)left(frac{2}{3}right)left(frac{1}{3}right) = 2cdotleft(frac{1}{3}right)^2left(frac{2}{3}right) = frac{4}{27}   ] - P(X=4) involves two scenarios: either player A wins, loses, wins, wins, or player B wins the next three games. So:   [   P(X=4) = {C}_{3}^{1}left(frac{1}{3}right)left(frac{2}{3}right)^2left(frac{1}{3}right) + left(frac{2}{3}right)^4 = frac{4}{27} + frac{16}{81} = frac{28}{81}   ] - P(X=5) occurs if player B wins the next three games, then player A wins, or if player A wins one, then player B wins three. So:   [   P(X=5) = {C}_{4}^{1}left(frac{1}{3}right)left(frac{2}{3}right)^3 = frac{32}{81}   ] The distribution of X is as outlined in the table above.

To simplify the notation and standardize our approach, let us make a substitution. Define (t = -y), which transforms our system into: [ begin{aligned} x + z + t & = 2,  x^2 + z^2 + t^2 & = 30,  x^3 + z^3 + t^3 & = 116. end{aligned} ] We now need to find the elementary symmetric polynomials for (x), (z), and (t).

Testing simple possible roots, we determine that (-1) is a root. This allows us to factorize: [ P(X) = (X + 1)(X^2 - 3X - 10). ] Next, we solve the quadratic equation (X^2 - 3X - 10 = 0): [ X = frac{3 pm sqrt{9+40}}{2} = frac{3 pm sqrt{49}}{2} = frac{3 pm 7}{2}. ] Thus, the roots are: [ X = 5 quad text{and} quad X = -2. ] The roots of (P(X)) are ( { -1, -2, 5 } ).

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 11, and 13. Since 9, 11, and 13 are all prime numbers except for 9 which is 3^2, their LCM is simply their product: LCM(9, 11, 13) = 9 * 11 * 13 Calculating this gives us: LCM(9, 11, 13) = 99 * 13 LCM(9, 11, 13) = 1287 Now, we want to find a multiple of 1287 that is less than 2590 and leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9, 11, and 13. To do this, we can subtract 6 from 2590 and then find the largest multiple of 1287 that is less than or equal to the result. 2590 - 6 = 2584 Now, we divide 2584 by 1287 to find the largest multiple: 2584 ÷ 1287 = 2 (with a remainder) So, the largest multiple of 1287 that is less than 2584 is: 2 * 1287 = 2574 Now, we need to check if 2574 leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9, 11, and 13. Since we subtracted 6 from 2590 to get 2584, and we know that 2574 is a multiple of 9, 11, and 13, adding 6 to 2574 should give us the desired remainders: 2574 + 6 = 2580 Now, let's check the remainders: 2580 % 9 = 6 2580 % 11 = 6 2580 % 13 = 6 Since 2580 leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9, 11, and 13, we have found the correct number.

Let's start by prime factorizing ( 3,150 ): ( 3,150 = 2 times 3 times 5^2 times 7 ) For a number to be a perfect square, all the prime factors must be raised to an even power. In the prime factorization of ( 3,150 ), the primes 2 and 7 are not squared, so we need to multiply ( 3,150 ) by at least one 2 and one 7 to make it a perfect square.

We need to prove that among the regions formed by these lines, there are at least 100 triangular regions. 2. **Calculate the number of intersection points:**    Since no three lines concur at a single point and no two lines are parallel, each pair of lines intersects exactly once. Thus, the number of intersection points can be calculated using the combination formula:    [    binom{300}{2} = frac{300 times 299}{2} = 44850    ] 3. **Find the total number of regions:**    According to a known result in combinatorial geometry, the maximum number of regions (R(n)) into which (n) lines divide a plane is given by:    [    R(n) = binom{n}{2} + binom{n}{1} + 1    ]    Here, (n = 300):    [    R(300) = binom{300}{2} + binom{300}{1} + 1 = 44850 + 300 + 1 = 45151    ] 4. **Find the number of triangular regions:**    We need to find a lower bound for the number of triangular regions formed. Consider one of the 300 lines and look at the intersection points not on this line but generated by the other 299 lines. Each pair of these lines intersects, and their segments form triangles.    We associate a triangle to each pair of lines intersecting our chosen line at two points. Since each point on the chosen line corresponds to an intersection of two other lines, there must be a triangle whose vertices are the chosen intersection point and two points on this line. 5. **Determine uniqueness of the triangles per line:**    Each triangle associated with a particular line must be unique and cannot be shared with more than two other lines:    - In total, 100 lines would suffice to cover all 300 lines if each triangle were associated distinctly. 6. **Conclusion:**    By considering the above arguments and the distribution of intersection points and lines, we conclude that the number of triangular regions cannot be fewer than 100.

We'll start by considering all possible sequences, then we'll exclude the sequences that do not contain the number '3'. This will give us the count of sequences meeting the given conditions. 1. **Counting All Possible Sequences:**     We first find the total number of sequences where any two consecutive numbers differ by no more than one.      Any such number sequence can be characterized as having differences of either (+1), (-1), or (0). Hence, the number of valid (difference) sequences of length (n-1) (or (99) when (n=100)) can be represented by:     [     3^{n-1}     ]     For (n=100):     [     3^{99}     ] 2. **Counting Sequences without the Number '3':**     We now count the sequences that only consist of the numbers ({1, 2}), as any such sequence will not include the number '3'.

Then (S) must lie on line (AB).     - Given (S) is on (AB), and considering circle properties, quadrilateral (SBDH) is cyclic. 5. **Equating Power of a Point**:     - We know that (A) power with respect to the cyclic quadrilateral implies:     [     AP^2 = AS cdot AB = AH cdot AD implies frac{AH}{AP} = frac{AP}{AD}     ]     - Recognizing the similarity in triangles, ( triangle APH sim triangle ADP). 6. **Angle Relationships**:     - From the similarity, the angles (angle AHP) and (angle APD) are equal.     - Similarly, we can establish:     [     angle AHQ = angle AQD     ]     - Since (angle APD + angle AQD = 180^circ), it follows:     [     angle AHP + angle AHQ = 180^circ     ] 7. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, points (P, H, Q) are collinear because they form a straight line with a sum of angles equal to (180^circ).

We know that 16 couple tickets were sold, so the total revenue from couple tickets is ( 16x ). Since a single ticket costs 20, and 128 people attended, we can calculate the number of single tickets sold by subtracting the number of people who used couple tickets from the total attendance. Each couple ticket accounts for 2 people, so the number of people who used couple tickets is ( 16 times 2 = 32 ). Therefore, the number of single tickets sold is ( 128 - 32 = 96 ).

Thus, the standard form of line l_1 is y=3x-2 or 3x-y-2=0. **Step 2: Find the distance between two parallel lines** Now that we have both lines in standard form, it's clear that they are parallel since they share the same slope (m=3). To find the distance between two parallel lines, we can use the formula d = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where A, B, and C are coefficients from one line's equation and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the other line.
