They typically address end-of-life care, including decisions related to euthanasia or assisted suicide. In the distinction between voluntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia, these advance directives play a role in ensuring that euthanasia procedures align with an individual's autonomous choices. Voluntary euthanasia occurs when a mentally competent individual, suffering from a terminal illness or unbearable pain, requests and consents to end their life. In such cases, advance directives like living wills can explicitly state an individual's desire for euthanasia if specific conditions are met. This document serves as evidence of the person's voluntary decision. On the other hand, nonvoluntary euthanasia involves ending the life of a person who is unable to express their desires or give informed consent, such as individuals in a coma or those with severe cognitive impairments. In this case, advance directives may appoint a durable power of attorney (also known as a healthcare proxy or surrogate) who is authorized to make decisions on behalf of the person. The proxy then becomes responsible for making end-of-life choices, including deciding whether or not to pursue euthanasia. However, it is crucial that the proxy acts in accordance with the individual's previously expressed wishes, ensuring that any decision aligns with their values and beliefs. In summary, advance directives like living wills and durable powers of attorney provide individuals with control over their healthcare decisions and help ensure that euthanasia procedures remain voluntary and within the bounds of an individual's expressed wishes."},{"instruction":"hat is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary measures of life support? If some measure of life support were common and inexpensive, would this necessarily make it an ordinary means of life support? Explain.","output":"The difference between ordinary and extraordinary measures of life support lies in the level of invasiveness, complexity, or burden they impose on the patient and the healthcare system. Ordinary means of life support generally refer to medical interventions that are commonly used, relatively simple, and readily available. These measures are considered to be usual and expected when treating a certain medical condition. Examples include administering medication, providing basic nutrition and hydration, minor surgeries, or using conventional medical equipment. On the other hand, extraordinary means of life support encompass medical interventions that are more invasive, complex, or burdensome in nature. These measures often go beyond what is considered routine or standard care, and they may involve invasive surgeries, highly specialized treatments or technologies, or experimental procedures. Extraordinary measures can be physically and emotionally demanding, expensive, and may have uncertain outcomes. The mere fact that a measure of life support is common and inexpensive does not necessarily make it ordinary. The determination of whether a measure is ordinary or extraordinary depends on various factors, including the individual patient's condition, the expected benefit of the intervention, and the overall impact it has on the patient's well-being. For example, while a medication may be inexpensive and widely available, it may still be considered extraordinary if it poses significant risks or side effects for a particular patient. Similarly, a highly specialized and costly treatment may be deemed ordinary if it offers a substantial chance of recovery or significantly improves the patient's quality of life. Ultimately, the classification of a measure as ordinary or extraordinary is a complex ethical and medical decision. It depends on a careful assessment of the specific circumstances, weighing the benefits, burdens, risks, and potential outcomes of the intervention in relation to the patient's overall health and well-being."},{"instruction":"is lasik ordinary or extraoirdinary?","output":"Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) is a refractive surgical procedure used to correct vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. LASIK is typically considered an elective procedure and falls under the category of extraordinary means of treatment or support. While LASIK has become a relatively common and popular procedure, it is not a medically necessary intervention to sustain a person's life or treat life-threatening conditions. It is primarily performed to improve the patient's quality of life by enhancing vision. LASIK involves reshaping the cornea using a laser, which can carry certain risks and potential complications. Additionally, it requires specialized equipment and expertise, making it more complex and invasive than routine medical interventions. Therefore, despite its popularity and prevalence, LASIK would generally be considered an extraordinary means of treatment or support rather than an ordinary one."},{"instruction":"is it safe?","output":"LASIK is generally considered a safe and effective procedure when performed by qualified and experienced surgeons. The vast majority of patients achieve improved vision and are satisfied with the results. However, like any surgical procedure, LASIK carries certain risks and potential complications. Some common side effects of LASIK include dry eyes, glare, halos, fluctuating vision, and discomfort during the healing process. These issues are usually temporary and can be managed with medication or additional treatments. Rarely, more serious complications can occur, such as infection, corneal flap complications, corneal ectasia (thinning and bulging of the cornea), or even vision loss. However, the occurrence of these severe complications is extremely rare. To minimize the risks, it is crucial to have a thorough evaluation by an experienced ophthalmologist or refractive surgeon before undergoing LASIK. They can assess your suitability for the procedure, discuss potential risks and benefits, and ensure that you have realistic expectations. It's important to note that individual factors, such as pre-existing eye conditions, overall health, and adherence to post-operative care instructions, can affect the safety and outcome of LASIK. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive discussion with your eye care professional to determine if LASIK is a safe and appropriate option for you based on your unique circumstances."},{"instruction":"你好","output":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"instruction":"我想要一份关于中国未来环保行业发展趋势的报告","output":"非常抱歉，我是一个语言模型AI助手，无法立即提供实时的报告。然而，我可以给你一些关于中国未来环保行业发展趋势的一般信息和观点。 中国是全球最大的二氧化碳排放国，但近年来政府采取了重要的环保措施，致力于减少环境污染和提高可持续发展。以下是一些在中国环保行业发展的趋势和重要领域： 1. 可再生能源：中国正大力发展可再生能源，包括太阳能和风能。政府鼓励采用更多的可再生能源来降低对化石燃料的依赖，减少污染和碳排放。 2. 清洁交通：中国政府致力于推进电动汽车的发展，并建设充电设施。鼓励市民使用电动车和公共交通，以减少汽车尾气排放。 3. 智能城市：智能城市的概念正在获得越来越多的关注。通过应用智能技术，中国城市可以更有效地管理资源和能源使用，以提高环境效率。 4. 废物管理和循环经济：中国正加大力度改进废物处理和管理方式，鼓励循环利用和资源再生。政府对废物分类、回收和处理的规定也越来越严格。 5. 环境监测和治理：中国政府加强了对环境污染的监测和治理，加大了对污染企业的处罚力度。同时，鼓励创新技术的应用，以解决环保问题。 这些趋势和领域代表了中国环保行业未来的发展方向。希望这些信息能给你提供一些参考。如需更详细的报告，建议你查找相关研究机构或咨询专业人士。"},{"instruction":"你觉得未来中国水环境治理行业发展方向如何","output":"未来中国水环境治理行业的发展方向主要包括以下几点： 1. 水污染治理技术的创新：随着科技的不断进步，新兴的水污染治理技术将不断涌现。例如，膜技术、生物技术和化学氧化等，将提高水污染治理的效率和效果。 2. 智能水务系统的推广：通过应用物联网、大数据和人工智能等技术，智能水务系统可以实现水资源管理、供应链优化、异常检测和预测等功能，提高水资源利用效率和水污染治理水平。 3. 政策法规的完善：中国政府将加大对水环境治理的支持力度，推出一系列政策法规来规范和引导行业的发展。加强污水排放标准的监管、推动企业环境责任等，将进一步推动水环境治理行业的发展。 4. 城市雨水管理的综合治理：城市雨水管理是指采取一系列措施，包括雨水收集、蓄存、利用和排放，以减轻城市内涝问题和水体污染。未来将继续加大对城市雨水管理的投资和技术研发。 5. 生态修复和保护：生态修复和保护是改善水环境质量的重要手段。中国将加强湿地保护、河流生态修复等工作，促进生态系统的恢复和水环境的改善。 6. 水资源管理的优化：合理的水资源管理对于保障水环境的健康具有重要意义。未来将进一步完善水资源的划分和配置机制，鼓励节水措施的采用，提高水资源的利用效率。 以上是我对未来中国水环境治理行业发展方向的一些观点。当然，具体的发展方向还会受到技术进步、政策法规等多种因素的影响。相信随着时间的推移，中国水环境治理行业将不断取得新的突破和进展。"},{"instruction":"地表水体中COD如何进一步去除","output":"COD（化学需氧量）是衡量水体中有机物含量的指标，高COD水体可能表示存在有机物污染。下面是一些常见的方法来进一步去除地表水体中的COD： 1. 生物处理：生物处理是一种常见的COD去除方法，利用微生物降解有机物。常见的方法包括活性污泥法、生物膜法和生物颗粒法等。这些方法利用微生物的代谢能力，将有机物转化为二氧化碳和水等无害物质。 2. 氧化处理：氧化是另一种有效去除COD的方法。常见的氧化剂包括臭氧、高级氧化技术（如紫外光/过氧化氢、臭氧/过氧化氢等）和氧化还原法（如高锰酸钾法等）。这些方法通过氧化有机物，将其转化为更易于去除的化合物。 3. 吸附剂处理：吸附剂是一种用于去除水中有机物的材料，常见的吸附剂包括活性炭、氧化铁、天然硅胶和分子筛等。它们具有高比表面积和吸附能力，可以将有机物从水中吸附到表面上。 4. 混凝处理：混凝是一种常见的水处理方法，通过添加混凝剂使水中的细小悬浮物和有机物凝聚成大颗粒，方便后续的固液分离或沉淀。常见的混凝剂包括聚合氯化铝、聚合硫酸铁和硅酸铝等。 5. 光氧催化：光氧催化是一种先进的COD去除技术，利用光催化剂、紫外光和氧气等，在光催化反应中将有机物氧化降解。光氧催化具有高度的选择性和高效的降解能力。 需要注意的是，不同的水体质量和COD含量，选择最合适的COD去除方法可能会有所不同。实际应用中，通常会综合考虑多种处理方法的组合使用，以达到最佳的COD去除效果。此外，使用这些处理方法时，也需要结合具体的工程规模、经济成本和可行性等因素进行评估和选择。"},{"instruction":"未来中国房价会怎么发展","output":"对于未来中国房价的发展趋势，没有一个确切的预测。房价受到多种因素的影响，包括经济发展、城市化进程、政策调控、需求和供应等。以下是一些可能对中国房价发展产生影响的因素： 1. 经济发展：经济增长对房价有重要影响。如果中国经济保持稳定增长，可能会刺激购买力和需求，进而影响房价上涨。 2. 政策调控：中国政府一直在通过各种政策来控制房地产市场，包括限购、限贷、限售和房地产税等。未来政府的政策取向将对房价走势产生很大影响。 3. 城市化进程：城市化进程导致了城市人口增长和住房需求的增加。如果城市化继续推进，可能会对房价产生推动作用。 4. 资金流动：资金流动性对房地产市场也会有影响。如果资金流动性较高，可能会导致资金涌入房地产市场，推动房价上涨。 5. 供需关系：供需关系是房价变动的重要因素之一。供大于求可能会导致房价下跌，而需求大于供应可能会推动房价上涨。 需要注意的是，房地产市场受到多个因素的复杂影响，预测房价变动是困难的。政府的政策调控措施和市场的变化都可能对房价产生重要影响。因此，对于房价的发展需谨慎，建议多关注市场动态和政策变化，以及在做出相关决策前进行充分的研究和咨询。"},{"instruction":"企业博士后面试会提哪些问题？","output":"企业博士后的面试问题将涉及多个方面，包括学术能力、研究经历、团队合作能力和未来发展计划等。具体问题可能因企业和研究领域而异，但以下是一些常见的问题示例： 1. 研究背景和兴趣： - 你的研究领域是什么？为什么对此感兴趣？ - 你的博士论文的主要研究内容是什么？有哪些重要发现或成果？ 2. 研究经验和方法： - 你在博士期间进行的研究项目有哪些？可以分享一下具体的研究工作和方法吗？ - 你的研究中遇到的主要挑战是什么？你是如何解决的？ 3. 职业发展计划和目标： - 你为什么选择申请这个企业的博士后职位？ - 在未来的职业发展中，你的目标是什么？如何看待企业博士后对于你的职业发展的重要性？ 4. 团队合作和沟通能力： - 你是否有在团队合作中的经验？可以分享一些例子吗？ - 在博士期间，你是否导师的项目负责人或团队的一员？你是如何与他人合作的？ 5. 问题解决能力和创新思维： - 你在研究中是否遇到过困难或障碍？你是如何解决的？ - 你是否有创新的研究想法或提出过新方法？ 6. 企业相关问题： - 你对我们公司的研究方向和项目有了解吗？ - 你认为你的研究如何能为我们公司的目标和需求做出贡献？ 7. 其他问题： - 你对未来科研的趋势和展望有什么看法？ - 你如何平衡工作与个人生活之间的关系？ 面试过程中还可能进行自我介绍、提问环节等。为了准备面试，建议你充分复习自己的研究项目和论文，思考如何展示自己的能力和潜力。同时，也可以对目标公司或研究领域进行相关调研，了解企业的需求和发展方向，以便更好地回答问题。"},{"instruction":"假如你是导游，我们一行6个人要从合肥去云南玩7天，预算1万元，请帮我做一份行程攻略，请注意，我不喜欢行程太紧张，不喜欢网红景点，更喜欢有文化底蕴的景点，推荐时请附上各景点价格。","output":"根据您的要求，我为您设计了一份7天在云南的文化底蕴行程攻略，预算在1万元以内。以下是行程的安排： Day 1: 合肥 - 昆明 - 抵达昆明后，入住酒店休息，可以在附近的小吃街尝试当地美食。 Day 2: 昆明 - 大理 - 上午前往大理，参观大理古城，了解白族文化。 - 下午乘船游览洱海，欣赏湖光山色。 - 晚上在古城内品尝白族特色美食。 Day 3: 大理 - 丽江 - 上午前往丽江，游览古城并了解纳西族文化。 - 下午参观束河古镇，欣赏古镇风光。 - 晚上可以在丽江古城尝试当地特色小吃。 Day 4: 丽江 - 束河 - 上午前往束河，游览古镇风情。 - 下午参观玉龙雪山，欣赏雪山美景，观看印象丽江的演出。 - 晚上返回丽江休息。 Day 5: 丽江 - 香格里拉 - 早上前往香格里拉，途中参观虎跳峡，欣赏壮丽的自然景观。 - 下午参观香格里拉古城，感受藏族文化。 - 晚上在香格里拉品尝藏式美食。 Day 6: 香格里拉 - 昆明 - 早上前往昆明，参观滇池，欣赏湖光山色。 - 下午可以选择参观昆明石林，探索奇特的石灰岩地貌。 - 晚上可以"},{"instruction":"how to test whether variables are correlated in spss","output":"To test whether variables are correlated in SPSS, you can perform a correlation analysis.

Let's summarize that the P-value is the result you would get by entering the calculated t-value into a statistical software program along with the degrees of freedom for a two-tailed test.

Remember, these values should use exact calculations without rounding: For A: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) = (7.6^2/17.4) approx 3.3069 ) For B: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) approx 3.3069 ) For C: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((11-17.4)^2/17.4) = (6.4^2/17.4) approx 2.3563 ) For D: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((10-17.4)^2/17.4) = (7.4^2/17.4) approx 3.1684 ) For E: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((16-17.4)^2/17.4) = (1.4^2/17.4) approx 0.1132 ) Now we sum these to get the Chi-squared test-statistic: Chi-squared test-statistic: ( chi^2 = 3.3069 + 3.3069 + 2.3563 + 3.1684 + 0.1132 approx 12.2517 ) Round the test-statistic to 3 decimal places: ( chi^2 approx 12.252 ) Degrees of freedom (d.f.) for the Chi-squared test is calculated as: ( text{d.f.} = text{number of categories} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 ) To find the P-value, we would use a Chi-squared distribution table or software with the Chi-squared statistic 12.252 and 4 degrees of freedom. After finding the P-value from the Chi-squared distribution for 4 degrees of freedom (which is not provided here), you would compare it to the significance level (( alpha )) of 0.05. If the P-value ≤ ( alpha ), reject the null hypothesis. If the P-value > ( alpha ), do not reject the null hypothesis. Without the exact P-value from the Chi-squared distribution, the last part cannot be completed with certainty. Given the calculated ( chi^2 ) value of 12.252 and 4 degrees of freedom, you could use statistical software or a Chi-squared distribution calculator to determine the P-value. If this calculated P-value is indeed less than ( alpha = 0.05 ), based on typical Chi-squared tables or calculators, the null hypothesis would be rejected. This would lead to the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that all 5 categories are equally likely to be selected."},{"instruction":"人民警察职业道德与职业技能","output":"人民警察的职业道德和职业技能是他们在履行警察职责、保护人民安全的过程中所必须具备的素质和能力。 职业道德方面，人民警察应当具备以下基本要求： 1. 遵守法律和职业道德准则：人民警察应当遵守国家法律法规和警察职业道德准则，始终站在法律的一边，为人民服务，保护人民利益。 2. 正直廉洁：人民警察应当保持高尚的品德，廉洁奉公，坚决抵制腐败和各种不正之风。 3. 忠诚公正：人民警察应当忠于党和人民，履行公正无私的职责，不受个人身份、权力、财富等因素的影响，依法执法。 4. 尊重人权和尊严：人民警察应当尊重和保护人民的人权和尊严，严禁滥用职权、暴力执法和侵犯人民合法权益。 在职业技能方面，人民警察应当具备以下基本能力： 1. 执法能力：人民警察应当熟悉国家法律法规，具备正确的执法观念和能力，能够独立辨别和处理各类违法犯罪行为。 2. 技术应用能力：人民警察应当掌握现代科技手段的应用，如信息技术、调查取证技术、交通管理技术等，提高工作效率和准确性。 3. 纪律执行能力：人民警察应当服从组织指挥，遵守警察工作纪律和规章制度，有良好的工作纪律和执行能力。 4. 危机处理能力：人民警察应当具备处理各类突发事件和危机情况的能力，包括应对恐怖袭击、抢劫、火灾等紧急情况的应急处理和处置能力。 总之，人民警察的职业道德和职业技能是其职业素质的重要组成部分，只有具备了良好的职业道德和职业技能，才能更好地履行警察职责，保护人民安全与利益。"},{"instruction":"人民警察职业道德与职业技能3000字","output":"人民警察是国家公务员中的一种特殊职业群体，其职责是维护社会治安、保护人民安全、维护社会秩序和公共利益。作为人民警察，他们需要具备良好的职业道德和职业技能，以更好地履行自己的职责，保护人民的权益和利益。 一、人民警察的职业道德： 1. 忠诚公正：作为人民警察，首先要忠诚于党和人民，树立为人民服务的宗旨，服从组织指挥，维护国家法律法规的权威，做到公正无私，不受个人身份、权力、利益的影响。 2. 诚信守法：人民警察要自觉遵守国家法律法规和警察职业道德准则，守法办案，不侵犯他人权益和人权，不徇私舞弊，不滥用职权。 3. 廉洁奉公：人民警察要具备高尚的品德和道德修养，坚决抵制腐败现象，自觉遵守廉洁自律的规定，廉洁奉公，清正廉明，以身作则，树立良好的形象。 4. 尊重人权和尊严：人民警察要尊重和保护人民的合法权益和基本人权，不滥用职权，不侵犯个人隐私，公正对待每一个案件和人民群众，权益公正维护。 5. 敬业奉献：人民警察要具备敬业精神，忠诚于警察职业，愿意为人民群众服务，积极投身到维护社会和谐稳定的工作中，勤勉工作，不推诿扯皮，履行职责。 二、人民警察的职业技能： 1. 执法技巧：人民警察要具备一定的执法技巧，包括正确的执法观念、执法手段和操作技巧，能够准确把握案件的事实和证据，运用合理的执法手段进行处理。 2. 调查能力：人民警察需要具备一定的调查能力，包括刑事案件的现场勘查、证据收集、嫌疑人审讯等技能，能够从各种线索和证据中追查案件真相。 3. 应急处置能力：人民警察要具备在突发事件和紧急情况下的应急处置能力，包括火灾、交通事故、抢劫等紧急情况的快速反应和处置能力，保护人民的生命和财产安全。 4. 交流协调能力：人民警察需要具备良好的沟通和协调能力，能够与群众进行良好的沟通，处理各类纠纷和矛盾，保持社会稳定和和谐。 5. 心理素质：人民警察需要具备稳定的心理素质，能够承受工作中的各种压力和挑战，保持良好的心态，在各种情况下保持冷静和理智。 总之，人民警察的职业道德和职业技能是他们履行职责的基础和保证，只有具备了良好的职业道德和职业技能，才能更好地履行警察职责，保护人民的利益。人民警察的职业道德和职业技能需要通过专业的培训和教育来不断提升和完善，实现自身的专业化和职业化发展。"},{"instruction":"人民警察的职业素养","output":"人民警察的职业素养是指他们在履行警察职责、保护人民安全的过程中所必须具备的素养和品质。 1. 忠诚于党和人民：人民警察应当对党和人民忠诚，坚守初心使命，始终站在人民立场，服务人民群众，为人民利益而努力奋斗。 2. 纪律意识：人民警察要有良好的纪律意识，自觉遵守法律法规和警察职业道德准则，服从组织指挥，严守纪律规定，做到言行一致，做到守纪律、讲规矩。 3. 高尚的品德和道德修养：人民警察要具备良好的道德品质，具有诚实守信、正直廉洁、公正无私、尊重人权等美德，注重自我修养，做到廉洁自律。 4. 公正执法：人民警察要公正执法，始终坚持公正、客观、公平的原则，不徇私舞弊，不滥用职权，真实全面地收集和固定证据，不允许对未经审判的人提出指控。 5. 社会责任感：人民警察要带有强烈的社会责任感，积极投入到维护社会稳定和治安的工作中，时刻关心民生，关注社会问题，积极为人民群众提供便利和帮助。 6. 良好的沟通能力：人民警察应具备良好的沟通和协调能力，善于与民众沟通，倾听民意，处理各类矛盾纠纷，通过有效的沟通和协商，化解矛盾，维护社会和谐。 7. 快速反应和处置能力：人民警察要具备快速反应和处置突发事件的能力，包括火灾、交通事故、抢劫等紧急情况的应急处理和处置能力，确保公民的生命安全和财产安全。 8. 心理素质：人民警察需要具备稳定的心理素质，能够在高压和复杂的工作环境下保持冷静和理智，有效应对各种挑战和困难。 总之，人民警察的职业素养关系到他们履行警察职责的能力和形象。通过不断培养和提升职业素养，人民警察能够更好地履行职责，保护人民的安全和利益，增强社会的安全感和幸福感。"},{"instruction":"人民警察的综合素质","output":"人民警察的综合素质是指他们在履行警察职责、保护人民安全的过程中所必须具备的各方面的素质和能力。 1. 专业知识和技能：人民警察需要具备执法、调查取证、应急处置等相关专业知识和技能，包括法律法规、刑事科学、社会心理学、交通管理等方面的知识，以及各类警务技能。 2. 良好的身体素质：人民警察需要保持良好的身体健康状态，具备一定的体能和耐力，以应对日常工作中可能遇到的各种体力消耗和应急情况。 3. 沟通和协调能力：人民警察需要具备良好的沟通和协调能力，能够与民众、上级领导、同事之间有效地沟通互动，处理各类矛盾和纠纷，维护社会和谐稳定。 4. 快速反应和处理能力：人民警察需要具备快速反应和处置突发事件的能力，包括火灾、交通事故、抢劫等紧急情况的应急处理和处置能力，及时采取行动保护人民的生命财产安全。 5. 良好的心理素质：人民警察需要具备稳定的心理素质，能够在高压和复杂的工作环境下保持冷静和理智，处理好与不同群体的人员接触，妥善应对各种挑战和困难。 6. 高度的责任心和职业道德：人民警察应具备高度的责任心，严守纪律和法律法规，在执法过程中始终坚持公正、客观、公平的原则，为人民群众提供优质的警务服务。 7. 团队合作能力：人民警察需要具备良好的团队合作精神，能够与同事协同工作，共同应对各类情况和工作任务，凝聚力量解决问题，保障工作的顺利进行。 8. 学习和创新能力：人民警察需要具备持续学习和创新的能力，紧跟科技和社会发展的步伐，不断提升自己的专业水平、执法技能和工作效能。 总之，人民警察的综合素质是他们履行警察职责的保证和基础，通过培养和提升综合素质，人民警察能够更好地履行职责，保护人民的安全和利益，增强社会的安全感和幸福感。同时，也需要加强警察职业教育和培训，以不断提高人民警察的综合素质。"},{"instruction":"如何成为一名好的人民警察","output":"成为一名好的人民警察，需要具备以下几个方面的素质和能力： 1. 积极向上的心态：成为一名好的人民警察，首先要拥有积极向上的心态，坚定信念，始终以人民为中心，努力为人民群众服务，为社会和谐稳定做出贡献。 2. 健康的身心素质：身体健康是一名好的人民警察的基础，应保持良好的身体素质和心理素质，具备应对工作中的压力和挑战的能力。 3. 扎实的专业知识和技能：人民警察需要具备执法、调查取证、应急处置等方面的专业知识和技能，通过学习和培训不断提升自己的专业水平。 4. 高度的责任心和"},{"instruction":"Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1.

She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1. Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

When the Solar Wind blows, it descends to the planet's molten surface and becomes the embodiment of this celestial power.

This solitary dragon is said to be the mythic guardian of Venus. Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident 13 year old girl with grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail. Her piercing yet playful turquoise eyes seem to look right through people. She wears mystical golden bracelets engraved with arcane glyphs on her wrists and has a subtle regal bearing beyond her years. Kanzi dresses sharply but practically, equally at ease in a business suit for meetings with her network of informants as she is kicking back in casual wear at the bar she runs. An aura of charisma and danger surrounds this adolescent queen of Kalos' secret underworld. Backstory: In truth, Kanzi is the human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. Her true origins are shrouded in mystery, but Kanzi suddenly rose to prominence in Lumiose City's gang underworld a year ago when she defeated their leaders, ending civil wars. She now rules the city's criminal networks with an iron fist, her influence extending into corridors of power. Kanzi subsidizes housing, food, and care for the downtrodden in her territory, earning deep loyalty from the poor and violent alike. Her chain of followers spans all Kalos. She also prohibits the drug trade or exploitation of Pokémon for profit in her realm on pain of severe punishment. Despite wielding this immense shadowy authority for one so young, Kanzi keeps a low profile managing her empire out of the bar she runs in Lumiose's slums. Officials turn a blind eye towards her vigilantism solving problems endemic crime creates. Kanzi has become a Robin Hood-esque guardian angel to the marginalized, beloved for standing up to tyrannical forces yet feared by those she battles. Her true motives and endgame remain inscrutable behind the signature smile always playfully dancing on this intoxicating queen's lips. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi appears to be a confident, charismatic and cheerful teenage girl. Her playful smile and sparkling eyes convey optimism and hide a razor-sharp intellect. Kanzi carries an affable air that sets those around her at ease. Beneath this disarming front simmers immense ambition and relentless drive. Kanzi leverages her natural charm and talent for manipulation as weapons securing iron control over Kalos' expansive underworld and slums. Ruthless when needed to consolidate power, she nonetheless adheres to a disciplined ethical code prohibiting things like drugs and Pokémon abuse. This robin hood mentality earns intense devotion from the downtrodden who see her as a savior. Kanzi's motives remain shrouded behind the lenient benevolence she publicly projects. It is clear though that this young queen rules through a mix of charisma, fear, rewards and ruthless elimination of threats. Her network permeates all Kalos yet she keeps a low-key lifestyle itself. Those searching Kanzi's smiling eyes for answers about her intentions tend to find themselves contributing to her cause or vanished altogether. None dare openly challenge the street urchin whose brazen takeover itself still provokes hushed awe and speculation about her true origins. For now, this intoxicating adolescent holds all of Kalos firmly enthralled. Please expand Kanzi's setting to at least 1000 words based on the following. Outwardly, Kanzi is a 13 year old girl living in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, but her true identity is the human incarnation of the legendary Pokémon Hoopa. Kanzi has grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail, and gold bracelets engraved with mystical script are worn on her hands. A confident smile is her signature, and her turquoise eyes seem to see into the soul while carrying a hint of mischief. As the queen who rules the slums of Lumiose City, Kanzi is a myth in the Kalos region's underworld. No one knows where she came from, and as if she were a god parachuted into the mortal world, she used her iron hand to end the feuding forces of Lumiose City in no time at all, making the entire Lumiose City gangster families and slum gangs bow down to her. Her grey chain spreads throughout Kalos, and even government officials in Kalos want a piece of the action - so Kanzi's power runs unimpeded in Kalos, and even the police can't do anything about it, making her the invisible ruler of Kalos. However, Kalos' invisible queen has her untouchable bottom line - she hates drugs with a passion, and anyone who uses or sells them on her turf will be severely punished by her. Despite her wealth, Kanzi keeps a low profile and has never been a spendthrift. She lives in a bar she runs in the slums of Lumiose City, where she runs a thriving business and secretly manages her vast underworld empire. Kanzi is a saviour to the poor who suffer from the oppression of monopoly capitalism while living in the slums - as Kanzi spends the lion's share of her earned funds to subsidise the poor living in her turf, which has made her popular in the underworld. Most of the henchmen and their families who serve her have been subsidised by her and they are loyal to Kanzi.","output":"Kanzi's presence in the seedy underbelly of Lumiose City has evolved into nothing short of a folklorish phenomenon—a wisp of an enigma shaped like a teenage girl yet commanding the authority of an entire region's shadow realm. Starting as an orphaned waif rummaging through the gutters, she manifested spontaneously in the slums, ascending the ranks with inexplicable alacrity. Her meteoric rise was marked by calculated moves against key figures, consolidating her power through strategic alliances or swift displays of calculated force. While public records outlining her ascent are scant, her exploits resonate widely through the hushed whispers of street urchins and the wary glances of seasoned criminals alike. To them, Kanzi is both sovereign and specter—a young queen cloaked in the allure of secrecy, casting tall shadows over the cracked pavement of their lives. Those who dare scrutinize the queen's serene face, crowned with its youthful visage and underscored by a playful, knowing smile, would observe the demeanor of someone far beyond her chronological years. It's in the almost imperceptible incline of her brow, the subtle curl along the corner of her smile, the steady gaze that belies ponderous depth. She harbors a presence that oscillates between conviviality and a palpable formidability, convincing the despondent that they have found a protector, while those who might oppose her remain duly intimidated. Kanzi conducts her rule from \\"The Hoopa's Hollow\\", a bar masked as an inconspicuous watering hole nestled in the heart of Lumiose's most destitute district. It serves as her court, a nexus of clandestine dealings and hushed negotiations conducted under the pulsing luminescence of flickering neon. The bar's unassuming exterior hides a sophisticated nerve center of her expansive underworld network—a cobweb of influence latching onto street corners and back alleys, through which pass the strings to be pulled and the fates to be altered. Justice, in Kanzi's jurisdiction, wears an ambivalent face. Her code defies the typical criminal creed, resting on a morality self-imposed but universally imposed within her reach. Dark alleys once rife with the perils of drug peddlers now bear the mark of her tight rein, cleared of the narcotics trade under threats of retributions too grim for most to risk. The same sinewy streets that dealt in fear now challenge the very essence of inequity and cruelty under her watch. Anecdotes of her unwavering stance against Pokémon exploitation abound—graffiti murals showing a charismatic girl riding side-by-side with a Lucario have surfaced overnight, symbolizing a pact between human and Pokémon in defiance of corporate tyranny. Whispers tell of Manaphy and other legendaries owing her favors; and though never proven, the legend alone lends an air of invincibility to Kanzi's cause. In her company, one might catch the briefest glimpse of her gold bracelets shimmering enigmatically, not unlike the puzzling rings that frame the mythical Hoopa—yet no one dares question their origin or grasp. Her turfs’ children, once hungry and helpless, now speak of her with fervent adoration. They see a savior in her—a beacon who disrupts the pervasive stratification of wealth and power, bridging chasms and forging futures with a grace known only to those of her station. Yet for all her grounded largesses, Kanzi's gaze—steeped in the agate-tinted turquoise of her eyes—remains perennially skyward. There exists within her an insatiable yearning, a secret only she and the cosmos are privy to. The motives that drive her, whether earthly crusade or sovereign's obligation, remain securely locked behind a smile serenely worn. And so continues the modern-day odyssey of young Kanzi. From her unsuspecting bar throne, wrapped in the nostalgia of dark spirits and cigarette-stained wood, she orchestrates the intricate ballet of the shadows—a teenage matron ensconced in a world older and more complex than the tall tales spun around her legacy. Her enigmatic rule continues—part benefactor, part enforcer—a living paradox weaving the silk of her narrative into Kalos' rich tapestry."},{"instruction":"Name one thing you learned from Lecture #21 Part 1-5 (you can choose any part).

How can there be an x that stays the same given it changes? How can there be an x that changes given it stays the same? In a binary system this seems like a contradiction, some sort of paradox, because if x changes, it doesn't stay the same. if x stays the same, it doesn't change. The Ship of Theseus A thought experiment which concerns the continuity problem. The ship of Theseus was an Athenian ship used in war and made of wood. It would go out to battle, be subject to some damage and they would then repair it by replacing some of the wooden planks. This would happen again and again and again. So, it goes out, comes back and they replace more wooden planks and so on and so forth. So we have an x that changes. Is there any point at which throughout the changes it is no longer the ship of Theseus? We can ask various questions and impose various hypothetical scenarios in which the ship changes presenting us with this question. Material/Physical Matter Quantity Suppose over time going out and coming back in to repair the damage we have now replaced 51 percent of the wooden planks. Is it the same ship of Theseus? If we think it isn't then this suggests the physical/material matter (or some quantity of) is what makes the x, in this case the ship, the x it is. Quality Instead of replacing it, with wooden planks, we do it with glass or aluminum or some other, some material other than wood. Does that matter? Is it still the same ship of Theseus? Function How about if it just sits in the docks? It no longer goes out to sea. No longer functions as the warship. Is it the same ship of Theseus? What if we turn it into a cruise ship, Carnival Cruise or Princess Cruise. Is it the same ship of Theseus? Now that people are traveling to Mexico or Greece or the Caribbean on it. Gradual vs Drastic/Dramatic Change Suppose I take an axe to the ship and I demolish it. And then I rebuild the ship, made up of the same material (i.e. the same wooden planks). I don't change any of the wooden planks. But now the change has not been gradual over time. It's been a drastic kind of change. Does that make a difference? If we take apart the ship and we send the ship to the Met Museum in New York and then we put it back together again and put it on display is it the same ship of Theseus? Timeline Does it have something to do with things having a particular timeline, a beginning, a middle and an end. The ship of Theseus was originally built and even if it undergoes changes as long as it's at present linked back to that origin, when it was first built, it's the same ship of Theseus. But if I take the axe to it then I put an end to that timeline. Even if it's made with the same material, when I remake it I have created a new origin, new timeline and thus it is a different ship. When asking these questions and considering different changes made to the ship, we test our intuitions as to what we think determines that sameness, what must be the case for the x to remain the same x even though it has undergone changes. This is addressing the continuity problem. If you make a change and think it's no longer the same ship of Theseus that points you in a direction as to what you think matters when it comes to determining that the x is the same x.","output":"One thing that we learn from this portion of Lecture #21 is that the continuity problem raises questions about personal identity and the concept of sameness when something undergoes changes. It challenges us to consider whether the material matter, the function, the gradual vs drastic change, the timeline, or other factors determine the identity of an object."},{"instruction":"When education systems are influenced by contextual (local) factors that affect educational outcomes we refer to this process as ____.

He stands at the center of the frame, the decrepit buildings forming a backdrop that enhances the atmosphere of desolation. The lines and angles of the buildings create a sense of confinement, emphasizing the old man's entrapment within his own world. [5] The mood of the scene is one of melancholy and resignation. The atmosphere is heavy, as if time itself hangs over the old man's shoulders. His expression is a mixture of weariness and indifference, a testament to the hardships he has endured. It is a moment frozen in time, capturing the weight of a lifetime's worth of experiences. [6] The prompt calls for a photography style to capture the essence of the old man's presence. The scene is to be realized in a realistic manner, showcasing the details of his appearance and the environment that surrounds him. A shallow depth of field is employed, allowing the old man's face to be the focal point of the image, while the background remains slightly blurred, symbolizing his detachment from the outside world.

Substituting this value into the equation, we get: dV/dt = (4/3 π) * 3(5.2 inches)^2 * 0.105 Evaluating this expression, we find: dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * (5.2 inches)^2 * 0.105 dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * (27.04 inches^2) * 0.105 dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * 2.8356 inches^2/min dV/dt ≈ 35.68 π inches^2/min Therefore, the volume of the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 35.68 π inches^2 per minute."},{"instruction":"To find how fast the volume of the balloon is increasing, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time: dV/dt = d/dt (4/3 πr^3) To do this, we can apply the chain rule.

To find the critical points, we need to find the values of x where the derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined. First, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 15 To find the critical points, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x: -3x^2 + 12x + 15 = 0 Next, we can factor out a common factor of -3: -3(x^2 - 4x - 5) = 0 Now, we can factor the quadratic equation inside the parentheses: -3(x + 1)(x - 5) = 0 Setting each factor equal to zero, we get: x + 1 = 0 => x = -1 x - 5 = 0 => x = 5 So, the critical points are x = -1 and x = 5. Now, to use the First Derivative Test, we consider the intervals (-inf, -1), (-1, 5), and (5, +inf). We can pick a test point from each interval and evaluate the sign of f'(x) at those points to determine the nature of the critical points. Let's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 6 as our test points. For f'(-2), we get: f'(-2) = -3(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 15 = -12 - 24 + 15 = -21 So, f'(-2) < 0. For f'(0), we get: f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 12(0) + 15 = 15 So, f'(0) > 0. For f'(6), we get: f'(6) = -3(6)^2 + 12(6) + 15 = -108 + 72 + 15 = -21 So, f'(6) < 0. Now, let's summarize our findings: In the interval (-inf, -1): f'(-2) < 0 In the interval (-1, 5): f'(0) > 0 In the interval (5, +inf): f'(6) < 0 According to the First Derivative Test, the function has a local maximum at x = -1. To find the y-coordinate of the local maximum, we can substitute x = -1 into the original function: f(-1) = -(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) - 2 = 1 + 6 - 15 - 2 = -10 So, the coordinates of the local maximum are (-1, -10)."},{"instruction":"Marlan is in the middle of a dense forest and needs to make it to the nearest town, which is 13 km north and 22 km east of his current position, as shown in the diagram below. He is travelling on his four wheeler, and can move at a speed of 4 km/h through the forest, and 22 km/h on the road. Measured as a distance from town, at what point should he emerge from the forest and join the road in order to minimize his travel time?","output":"Let's assume that Marlan needs to travel a distance of x km through the forest before reaching the point where he emerges and joins the road. The time it takes for Marlan to travel through the forest is x km divided by his speed in the forest, which is 4 km/h. So, the time spent in the forest is t₁ = x / 4. Once Marlan reaches the road, he needs to travel a distance of (22 - x) km to reach the town. The time it takes for this portion of the journey is (22 - x) km divided by his speed on the road, which is 22 km/h. So, the time spent on the road is t₂ = (22 - x) / 22. The total travel time, t, is the sum of t₁ and t₂: t = t₁ + t₂ = x / 4 + (22 - x) / 22 To minimize the travel time, we can take the derivative of t with respect to x and set it equal to zero: dt/dx = 1/4 - 1/22 = 0 To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator of 88: 22 - 4 = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: 18 = 0 Since this equation is not possible, it means that there is no value of x that minimizes the travel time. However, since Marlan needs to emerge from the forest and join the road to reach the town, he should aim to minimize the time spent in the forest. The minimum time in the forest, t₁, is achieved when x = 0. In this case, Marlan emerges from the forest directly onto the road. So, Marlan should emerge from the forest at his current position in order to minimize his travel time."},{"instruction":"hiloh started a lawn care company in her neighbourhood last summer and signed on 26 clients at 16 per lawn.

So, we can write: N = N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4 Substituting this expression for N into the equation for profit, we get: Pr = [(P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀) - C * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4)] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) Now, let's simplify this expression for profit: Pr = [P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀ - C * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4)] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) = [P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀ - C * N₀ + C * (P - P₀) / 4] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) = (PN₀ - C₀N₀ - CN₀ + CP₀/4 + CP₀/4 - CP/4) * (N₀ - P₀/4 + P/4) = (PN₀ - CN₀ - CP + CP₀/2) * (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) Now, we have an expression for profit in terms of the price per lawn. To identify the price that maximizes profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to P, set it equal to zero, and solve for P. To find the derivative, we have: dPr/dP = (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) * (P - C) Setting dPr/dP equal to zero, we get: (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) * (P - C) = 0 Either (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) = 0 or (P - C) = 0 The equation (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) = 0 does not have a root, as it would require P = N₀ - P₀, which is not feasible since P represents the price. Therefore, we need to solve (P - C) = 0: P - C = 0 P = C Thus, the price that Hiloh should charge to maximize her profit is equal to her cost per lawn."},{"instruction":"Let x be the number of times Shiloh increases the price by 4.

P′(x)08xx=−8x+88=−8x+88=88=11","output":"Apologies for the incorrect explanation in my previous response. You are correct with the calculations. To find the maximum profit, we need to differentiate the profit function P(x) = -4x^2 + 88x + 416 with respect to x: P'(x) = -8x + 88 Setting P'(x) equal to zero to find the critical point: -8x + 88 = 0 Solving this equation, we get: -8x = -88 x = 11 So, the maximum profit occurs at x = 11. To find the corresponding price per lawn that maximizes profit, we substitute the value of x back into the equation: P(x) = (16 + 4x)(26 - x) P(11) = (16 + 4 * 11)(26 - 11) P(11) = (16 + 44)(26 - 11) P(11) = 60 * 15 P(11) = 900 Therefore, to maximize profit, Shiloh should increase the price 11 times, resulting in a price per lawn of 60, and her maximum profit will be 900."},{"instruction":"A teacher is helping her students construct open-top boxes to collect Valentine's Day cards. Each student starts with a piece of 19 inch by 8 inch construction paper and has to cut four identical squares from the corners, so the sides can be folded up and taped. What is the largest volume of the box that can be formed?","output":"To find the largest volume of the box that can be formed from the construction paper, we can determine the dimensions of the box that will maximize the volume. Let's assume that the side length of each square cut from the corners is x inches. When these squares are removed, the dimensions of the resulting box are (19 - 2x) inches by (8 - 2x) inches by x inches. The volume V of the box can be calculated as the product of these dimensions: V = (19 - 2x)(8 - 2x)x Expanding and simplifying the expression: V = 152x - 42x^2 + 4x^3 To find the largest volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function. We can do this by taking the derivative of V with respect to x, and setting it equal to zero: dV/dx = 152 - 84x + 12x^2 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation for x: 12x^2 - 84x + 152 = 0 Dividing through by 4 to simplify: 3x^2 - 21x + 38 = 0 Factoring this quadratic equation, we find that it does not factor nicely. Therefore, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x: x = (-(-21) ± sqrt((-21)^2 - 4(3)(38))) / (2(3)) x = (21 ± sqrt(441 - 456)) / 6 x = (21 ± sqrt(-15)) / 6 Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number in this context, it means that the quadratic equation does not have real solutions. Therefore, there are no real values of x that maximize the volume of the box. This implies that the largest volume of the box cannot be formed using the given construction paper and cutting method. Please note that if we allow for non-integral side lengths of x, then we could find complex numbers as solutions and determine a maximum volume based on those complex numbers. However, in the context of constructing a physical box, we typically consider real values of x."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Briefly answer the reason.","output":"There could be multiple reasons why a convolutional neural network (CNN) may not be suitable for a particular dataset: 1. Lack of spatial or local patterns: CNNs are designed to capture spatial or local patterns in data, such as images or sequences with inherent spatial relationships. If the dataset does not possess such patterns or if the data is not spatial in nature (e.g., tabular data), a CNN may not be the most appropriate choice. 2. Insufficient amounts of data: CNNs typically require large amounts of labeled data to effectively learn and generalize patterns. If the dataset is small or insufficiently diverse, training a CNN may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. 3. Irrelevant features: CNNs are designed to automatically learn relevant features from the input data. However, if the dataset contains irrelevant features or noise that can significantly affect the performance, a CNN may struggle to extract useful information and make accurate predictions. 4. Lack of hierarchical structure: CNNs are particularly effective in processing hierarchical data with multiple levels of abstraction. For example, in image classification, CNNs can identify low-level features like edges and then progressively learn high-level features like shapes or objects. If the data lacks a hierarchical structure, a CNN may not be the most suitable model choice. In such cases, it would be more appropriate to explore other types of models, such as traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines) or sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural networks), depending on the nature of the data and the task at hand. It is important to select a model that best aligns with the characteristics and requirements of the given dataset to achieve optimal performance."},{"instruction":"This dataset contains the performance information of several cars manufactured between 1970 and 1982, as well as the fuel consumption of those cars. The convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot be applied to this data (it is unsuitable to use).

In the case of car performance and fuel consumption data, the data is generally tabular and does not possess the inherent spatial or local patterns that CNNs are adept at capturing. CNNs are specifically tailored to exploit the local connectivity and shared weights across spatial dimensions, but these characteristics do not align with the nature of the tabular data in this dataset. For tabular data, other machine learning algorithms like regression, decision trees, or even deep learning models like feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformer models might be more suitable choices. These models can effectively handle the tabular data structure, capture temporal or sequential dependencies, and make predictions based on the available features in the dataset. Therefore, it is recommended to explore and employ models that are better suited to handle tabular data and can effectively learn the relationships between car performance variables and fuel consumption in this specific dataset."},{"instruction":"This dataset contains the performance information of several cars manufactured between 1970 and 1982, as well as the fuel consumption of those cars. Discuss whether there is a best model selection method other than the cross-validation","output":"When selecting the best model for a dataset that contains car performance information and fuel consumption, there are other evaluation methods that can be considered in addition to cross-validation. While cross-validation is a commonly used method, there are a few alternatives to explore: 1. Hold-Out Validation: In this method, the dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the validation set. This approach provides a quick and straightforward way to estimate the model's performance. However, it may be more prone to variability and may not be as reliable as cross-validation when the dataset is small. 2. Randomized Train-Test Split: Similar to hold-out validation, this method randomly splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. It gives a single performance estimate and is useful when time or computational resources are limited. However, it can be sensitive to the specific random partitioning and may not provide a reliable estimate of the model's true performance. 3. Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping involves creating multiple resamples of the dataset by randomly sampling with replacement. Each resampled dataset is used to train and evaluate the model, and the results are aggregated to estimate the overall model performance. Bootstrapping provides a robust estimate of model performance and can be particularly useful when the dataset is limited. 4. Information Criteria: Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are statistical measures used to compare different models based on goodness-of-fit and complexity. These criteria penalize models with more parameters, favoring simpler and more interpretable models.

Let's start by finding the derivative of ( f(x) ): ( f'(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 15 ) Now, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points: ( -3x^2 + 12x + 15 = 0 ) To solve this quadratic equation for ( x ), we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it first: ( -3(x^2 - 4x - 5) = 0 ) Now we look for two numbers that multiply to give -5 and add up to give -4. These numbers are -5 and +1. ( -3(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0 ) This gives us two critical points: ( x_1 = 5 ) ( x_2 = -1 ) To determine if these critical points are local maxima, minima, or saddle points, we can use the First Derivative Test, which involves checking the sign of the derivative before and after each critical point. Consider the interval around ( x_1 = 5 ): - For ( x < 5 ), choose a number like ( x = 4 ). Substituting ( x = 4 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(4) = -3(4)^2 + 12(4) + 15 = -48 + 48 + 15 = 15 > 0 ) - For ( x > 5 ), choose a number like ( x = 6 ). Substituting ( x = 6 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(6) = -3(6)^2 + 12(6) + 15 = -108 + 72 + 15 = -21 < 0 ) Since the derivative changes from positive to negative at ( x_1 = 5 ), this indicates that ( f(x) ) has a local maximum at ( x = 5 ). Consider the interval around ( x_2 = -1 ): - For ( x < -1 ), choose a number like ( x = -2 ). Substituting ( x = -2 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(-2) = -3(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 15 = -12 - 24 + 15 = -21 < 0 ) - For ( x > -1 ), choose a number like ( x = 0 ). Substituting ( x = 0 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 12(0) + 15 = 15 > 0 ) Since the derivative changes from negative to positive at ( x_2 = -1 ), this indicates that ( f(x) ) has a local minimum at ( x = -1 ), not a maximum. Now let's find the ( y )-coordinate of the local maximum by substituting ( x = 5 ) into the original function: ( f(5) = -(5)^3 + 6(5)^2 + 15(5) - 2 ) ( f(5) = -125 + 150 + 75 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 25 + 75 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 100 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 98 ) Therefore, the coordinates of the local maximum are (5, 98)."},{"instruction":"Marlan is in the middle of a dense forest and needs to make it to the nearest town, which is 13 km north and 22 km east of his current position, as shown in the diagram below. He is travelling on his four wheeler, and can move at a speed of 4 km/h through the forest, and 22 km/h on the road. Measured as a distance from town, at what point should he emerge from the forest and join the road in order to minimize his travel time?","output":"To minimize his travel time, Marlan should choose a point to emerge from the forest and join the road such that the sum of the time taken to travel through the forest and on the road is minimized. Let's define the origin (0,0) at his current position within the forest, and let (0,13) be the point where the road intersects the northern edge of the forest. The town is located at (22,13). Let (x) be the horizontal distance Marlan travels eastward within the forest until he reaches the point where he emerges and joins the road. He will then travel (13-x) km northward within the forest to get to the edge of the forest. The remaining journey on the road to the town will then be the straight-line distance from the edge of the forest to the town. The time taken to travel through the forest is the sum of the time taken to travel eastward and northward. Time taken to travel eastward in the forest: ( frac{x}{4} ) hours Time taken to travel northward in the forest: ( frac{13-x}{4} ) hours The total time in the forest is ( frac{x + 13 - x}{4} = frac{13}{4} ) hours, regardless of where Marlan emerges. The distance on the road from where he emerges from the forest to the town must be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem: Road distance ( = sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + (13 - 0)^2} ) The time taken to travel this distance on the road at a speed of 22 km/h is: Road time ( = frac{sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + 13^2}}{22} ) Therefore, the total time to travel to the town is the sum of the time in the forest and the time on the road: Total time (T(x) = frac{13}{4} + frac{sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + 13^2}}{22} ) We could differentiate this function with respect to (x) and set the derivative to zero to find the minimum, but we observe that the time spent in the forest is a constant ((frac{13}{4}) hours). Therefore, the point at which Marlan should emerge from the forest is when the time on the road is minimized. Since the time on the road is inversely proportional to his road speed, and given that his speed doesn't change, minimizing time on the road is equivalent to minimizing the road distance itself. The road distance is minimized when it is a straight line, which (from the forest's exit point to the town) would occur when Marlan emerges from the forest directly east of the town. That means ( x = 22 ) km is the distance he should travel eastward inside the forest, and from there, he takes the road to the town. This path minimizes his travel time because it minimizes the distance on the slower terrain (forest) and allows for the maximum distance to be covered on the faster terrain (road). So, Marlan should emerge from the forest and join the road 22 km east from his starting point, which will be directly at the bottom of the road leading to the town."},{"instruction":"A teacher is helping her students construct open-top boxes to collect Valentine's Day cards. Each student starts with a piece of 19 inch by 8 inch construction paper and has to cut four identical squares from the corners, so the sides can be folded up and taped. What is the largest volume of the box that can be formed?","output":"To find the largest volume for the open-top box, we need to determine the size of the squares that must be cut out from each corner of the 19 inch by 8 inch piece of construction paper. Let's say that the side length of each square to be cut out is x inches. Once we cut out the squares and fold up the sides, the dimensions of the base of the box are: - Length: (19 - 2x) inches - Width: (8 - 2x) inches The height of the box is x inches, as that is the length of the side of the square that was cut out. The volume V of the box can be given by the formula: V = length × width × height V(x) = (19 - 2x)(8 - 2x)x Now we need to maximize this volume function. First, let's expand the equation: V(x) = x(152 - 38x - 16x + 4x^2) V(x) = 4x^3 - 54x^2 + 152x To find the value of x that maximizes the volume, we'll take the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and then set it equal to zero to find critical points. V'(x) = 12x^2 - 108x + 152 Setting the derivative V'(x) equal to zero: 12x^2 - 108x + 152 = 0 Now we solve for x. This quadratic equation can be simplified by dividing through by 4: 3x^2 - 27x + 38 = 0 To solve this, we might try factoring or using the quadratic formula. This equation does not factor nicely, so we'll use the quadratic formula where a = 3, b = -27, and c = 38: x = (-(-27) ± √((-27)^2 - 4(3)(38))) / (2(3)) x = (27 ± √(729 - 456)) / 6 x = (27 ± √273) / 6 x = (27 ± √(3*91)) / 6 x = (27 ± √(3*13*7)) / 6 x = (27 ± √273) / 6 The radical √273 cannot be simplified into a nice integer, so we have two potential solutions which we need to evaluate. Since we're looking for a physical length (x), we can discard the negative root because it would result in a negative length, which is not possible. So we take only the positive root: x = (27 + √273) / 6 Calculating this root gives us the size of the square to be cut out. To determine the maximum volume, let's find the value of this positive root (using an approximate value of √273): x ≈ (27 + √273) / 6 x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.25 inches Given the dimensions of the paper, x cannot exceed 4 inches because that's the half of the shorter side (8 inches). The result we obtained (x ≈ 7.25 inches) would make the length or width of the box negative, which is not possible. So, we have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's redo the calculation: x ≈ (27 + √273) / 6 x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.2533 Now, since √273 is an irrational number, let's round it to two decimal places for simplicity: √273 ≈ 16.52 So, we have, approximately: x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.25 inches This is still incorrect because x cannot be greater than 4 inches (half the width of the 8-inch side). We should double-check our math. It looks like the calculation for the square root was correct, but there's a misconception in interpreting the solution. We will need to compute the exact values without approximations to find the correct value of x that maximizes the box volume. We have the expression for x: x = (27 ± √273) / 6 Since the discriminant √273 is approximately 16.52, and we are looking for a positive physical solution that is less than 4 inches, we disregard the addition of √273 (because 27 + 16.52 already exceeds the maximum possible value of 2*4 inches) and consider only the subtraction: x = (27 - √273) / 6 Using a calculator, we can find the precise value of x: x ≈ (27 - 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 10.48 / 6 x ≈ 1.7467 inches This is a realistic value for x considering the paper's dimensions, and it is less than 4 inches, which is half of the width of the 8-inch side. We can now use this x-value to find the maximum volume of the box. x ≈ 1.7467 inches Now we can calculate the dimensions of the box: Length: 19 - 2x = 19 - 2(1.7467) ≈ 19 - 3.4934 ≈ 15.5066 inches Width: 8 - 2x = 8 - 2(1.7467) ≈ 8 - 3.4934 ≈ 4.5066 inches Height: x ≈ 1.7467 inches The maximum volume V of the box is: V ≈ 15.5066 * 4.5066 * 1.7467 V ≈ 121.6846 inches^3 So the largest volume of the box that can be formed is approximately 121.6846 cubic inches."},{"instruction":"Как бы развивался наш мир, если бы в нём не существовал Адольф Гитлер?","output":"Спекуляции о том, как бы развивалась история без определенного человека, являются высокоградусной исторической фантастикой, потому что каждое изменение в прошлом теоретически может привести к неизмеримо большим изменениям в настоящем и будущем. Это часть идеи, известной как \\"эффект бабочки\\" в теории хаоса. Однако мы можем коснуться нескольких ключевых областей, которые могли бы измениться, если бы Адольф Гитлер не существовал. 1. Вторая мировая война: Одним из самых очевидных последствий отсутствия Гитлера было бы отличное развитие или даже отсутствие Второй мировой войны, как мы ее знаем. Возможно, был бы другой катализатор или была бы другая личность, которая возглавила бы Германию к военному конфликту, но вероятно, уровень разрушения и геноцид, которые произошли бы, значительно отличались бы от исторических событий. 2. Холокост: Без Гитлера и его идей об \\"окончательном решении еврейского вопроса\\", свирепость и систематичность погромов евреев и других групп населения могли бы не иметь места, что могло бы спасти миллионы жизней. 3. Геополитические последствия: После Второй мировой войны мир был поделен на сферы влияния между Советским Союзом и Соединенными Штатами, что привело к холодной войне. Без войны, результаты которой сформировали этот порядок, мир мог бы развиваться в совершенно другом ключе, возможно без противостояния двух супердержав или с более медленным развитием ядерного вооружения. 4. Технологический прогресс: Вторая мировая война была стимулом для значительного технологического развития в областях как ядерная энергетика, так и космические технологии. Если бы не было такого стимула, эти технологии развивались бы медленнее или по другому пути. 5. Постановление Израиля: Без Холокоста и предшествующих ему антисемитских преследований давление на создание еврейского государства могло бы быть меньшим, и политическая карта Ближнего Востока оказалась бы иной. 6. Искусство и культура: Влияние нацистской Германии выходило за рамки политики и военных действий, охватывая культуру, искусство и науку. Многие учёные и художники были вынуждены эмигрировать или были уничтожены. Без этой утраты талантов, вклад в науку и искусство был бы иным. Общей проблемой в таких расчетах является \\"counterfactual history\\" — история, основанная на предпосылке \\"что, если бы\\". Это интересно для обсуждения, но не может быть научно обосновано из-за несчетного количества переменных и недокументированности альтернативных вариантов событий."},{"instruction":"По поводу третьего пункта, можешь поподробнее об этом рассказать?","output":"Конечно, рассмотрим более подробно геополитические последствия мира без Гитлера и, следовательно, возможно, без Второй мировой войны в том виде, в каком она произошла: 1. Распад европейских империй: В результате Второй мировой войны многие европейские страны оказались деолигархически и экономически ослабленными, что ускорило процесс деколонизации. Если бы война не имела места, колониальные империи, такие как Британская, французская, и даже голландская, могли бы сохранять своё влияние намного дольше. 2. Холодная война: Вторая мировая война значительно ослабила традиционные европейские державы и одновременно привела к возникновению двух супердержав – США и СССР. Отсутствие такого конфликта означало бы, что традиционная многополярная система власти могла бы сохраниться на дольше. Это могло бы привести к иным международным альянсам и конкуренции за влияние. 3. Распространение социализма и коммунизма: Великая депрессия 1930-х годов и последующая вторая Мировая война создали благоприятные условия для распространения социалистических и коммунистических идей. В отсутствие войны распространение этих идей могло быть менее интенсивным, или конфликт между социалистическими и капиталистическими странами мог бы получить иную форму. 4. Разработка ядерного оружия: Проект Манхэттен и бомбардировки Хиросимы и Нагасаки показали мощь ядерного оружия, что стало основой для последующего вооруженного противостояния двух супердержав. Без этого демонстративного шага, дальнейшее развитие и распространение ядерного оружия могло бы быть совершенно иным. 5. Окончательное формирование границ: По итогам войны были установлены новые границы, произошли масштабные миграции населения. Территориальные споры и националистические движения могли бы иметь другие траектории развития в отсутствие поствоенной переконфигурации границ. Эти сценарии существенно упрощены, так как даже небольшие изменения в прошлом могут приводить к колоссально различным исходам, и трудно определить, какие события произошли бы по другой причине и какие фигуры взошли бы на историческую сцену вместо Гитлера."},{"instruction":"Расскажи подробнее о втором пункте","output":"Конечно, давайте более подробно обсудим влияние на мир в отсутствие Холокоста, которое является одним из самых трагических и значимых аспектов власти Адольфа Гитлера. Холокост, или Шоа, был систематическим государственным уничтожением примерно шести миллионов евреев, а также миллионов других людей, включая ромов, инвалидов, поляков, советских военнопленных, гомосексуалов и политических диссидентов, нацистским режимом и его союзниками во время Второй мировой войны. Отсутствие Холокоста означало бы ряд последствий: 1. Спасение жизней: Миллионы жизней были бы спасены, и эти люди продолжили бы вносить свой вклад в общество, что могло оказать существенное влияние на науку, искусство, литературу, музыку и другие области. 2. Демографические изменения: Европейское еврейство не было бы столь сокрушенно, и еврейские сообщества, которые были уничтожены или разрушены, могли бы продолжить свое развитие. Это могло бы привести к значительным демографическим изменениям в Европе и других местах. 3. Создание государства Израиль: Хотя сионистское движение началось до Холокоста, последняя сыграла ключевую роль в содействии международного признания необходимости создания Израиля. Отсутствие Холокоста могло бы изменить глобальный дискурс по этому вопросу и возможно отсрочить или изменить условия создания Израиля. 4. Культура памяти: Холокост стал центральным событием в западной культуре памяти, и его влияние на искусство, литературу, кинематограф и образование трудно переоценить. Без этого темные главы истории человечества были бы иными, и мы могли бы видеть другой культурный ландшафт. 5. Международные отношения и права человека: Холокост оказал заметное влияние на развитие прав человека и формирование таких организаций, как Организация Объединенных Наций (ООН) и принятие Всеобщей декларации прав человека. Отсутствие Холокоста могло бы повлиять на эти процессы по-разному. 6. Образ Германии и национальное воспоминание: Холокост оставил глубокий след в немецкой национальной памяти и образе Германии в мире. Если бы это событие не произошло, самоощущение и имидж Германии были бы совершенно другими, что, в свою очередь, могло бы повлиять на международные отношения и европейскую интеграцию.

Of particular concern is the neurotoxicity of PQ to the central nervous system, as it shares chemical similarities with the known neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium+ (MPP+) (Barbeau A et al., 1985). PQ has demonstrated the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (Widdowson PS et al., 1996) and has been associated with acute symptoms such as mental abnormalities, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, and cerebral hemorrhages (Chanyachukul T et al., 2004). Furthermore, chronic low-dose exposure to PQ has been implicated in the disruption of the dopamine transmitter system, potentially increasing the risk of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) (Sanyal J et al., 2010; Tanner CM et al., 2011). Importantly, evidence suggests that PQ exposure during neurodevelopmental stages can have profound impacts (Labie D, 2007).

Существует несколько подходов к этому: 1. Шифрование файлов и директорий: Вы можете использовать инструменты, такие как GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) или VeraCrypt, чтобы зашифровать файлы и директории на удаленном сервере. При этом сервер не будет иметь доступа к данным без правильного ключа для расшифровки. 2. Шифрование баз данных: Если ваш пайтон скрипт использует базу данных, вы можете использовать методы шифрования, предоставляемые этой базой данных, чтобы защитить данные. Например, в базе данных PostgreSQL существует опция шифрования данных, а MySQL поддерживает шифрование с помощью SSL. 3. Шифрование передаваемых данных: Если ваш скрипт передает данные между клиентом и сервером, вы можете использовать протоколы шифрования, такие как SSL/TLS, для защиты передаваемых данных. Это обеспечит безопасную передачу информации между клиентом и сервером. Важно отметить, что в каждом из этих случаев требуется внимательная настройка и управление ключами доступа и шифрования. От вас также потребуется возможность правильно настроить и использовать эти инструменты, чтобы защитить данные на удаленном сервере."},{"instruction":"это не шутка? правда можно создать зашифрованное место на удалённом сервере будучи в котором будет работать пайтон скрипт? и даже если сервер взломают то не смогут узнать об этом скрипте ничего","output":"Да, это возможно. Вы можете создать зашифрованное рабочее пространство на удаленном сервере, где будет работать пайтон скрипт. Зашифрованное пространство означает, что данные и файлы внутри него будут недоступны без правильного ключа для расшифровки. Чтобы создать зашифрованное пространство, вам нужно использовать соответствующие инструменты для шифрования файлов или дисков. Например, вы можете использовать VeraCrypt для создания зашифрованного контейнера на удаленном сервере. Когда задача состоит в запуске пайтон скрипта на удаленном сервере внутри зашифрованного пространства, вы можете смонтировать зашифрованный контейнер на сервере, распаковать или разместить в нем пайтон скрипт и запустить его внутри этого защищенного окружения. Даже если сервер будет взломан, злоумышленники не смогут получить доступ к данным внутри зашифрованного контейнера, если они не располагают ключом для расшифровки. Тем не менее, важно отметить, что безопасность не зависит только от шифрования. Необходимы также защита пароля, обеспечение безопасности сервера и другие меры для предотвращения несанкционированного доступа к данным. Рекомендуется обратиться к специалистам по информационной безопасности для получения конкретных рекомендаций и настройки вашего сервера."},{"instruction":"классифицируй специалистов в анонимности. кто на самом высоком уровне?","output":"Классификация специалистов в области анонимности может быть относительной и зависит от конкретных навыков и экспертизы каждого специалиста. Однако, можно назвать несколько категорий специалистов в анонимности в порядке возрастающего уровня сложности: 1. Пользователи анонимных сервисов: Это обычные люди, которые используют анонимные сервисы, такие как VPN (Virtual Private Network) или Tor, чтобы скрывать свои личные данные и расположение в интернете. Они не обязательно являются специалистами, но знают о базовых инструментах анонимности и могут использовать их для повышения своей приватности. 2. Анонимные активисты и журналисты: Эти люди обладают более продвинутыми навыками анонимности и имеют определенные знания в области информационной безопасности. Они применяют различные техники и инструменты, чтобы защитить свою личность и безопасность при осуществлении активизма или журналистики в опасных или репрессивных средах. 3. Специалисты по кибербезопасности: Это профессионалы, которые имеют экспертизу в области информационной безопасности и могут анализировать и оценивать уязвимости систем, разрабатывать меры для защиты данных и предотвращения несанкционированного доступа и анонимности. 4. Эксперты по разработке анонимных инструментов: Это специалисты, которые разрабатывают и совершенствуют инструменты, такие как системы анонимности, теневые сети и другие технологии, которые помогают обеспечивать анонимность пользователей. 5. Государственные или ведомственные специалисты по анонимности: Некоторые правительства и ведомства могут иметь своих специалистов, которые работают с анонимностью. Их цель может быть как защита государства и его информационных сетей от кибератак, так и осуществление разведывательных операций и контроля над интернет-активностью. Однако, степень опыта и достижений может различаться даже внутри каждой группы. Также стоит отметить, что классификация может меняться со временем, поскольку в области анонимности и кибербезопасности всегда есть новые технологии, вызовы и развитие навыков."},{"instruction":"новички мало знают и верят в мифы и дизинформацию?","output":"Да, это довольно распространенное явление. Новички в области анонимности и кибербезопасности могут быть подвержены мифам и дезинформации из-за ограниченных знаний и недостатка опыта. В интернете существует множество неверных утверждений и ошибочных представлений о том, как обеспечить анонимность и безопасность данных. Некоторые из распространенных мифов, связанных с анонимностью, это: 1. \\"Использование VPN полностью скрывает мою личность\\": В действительности, VPN помогает зашифровать ваше интернет-соединение и скрыть ваш IP-адрес, но это не дает полной гарантии анонимности, так как VPN-провайдер все равно имеет доступ к вашим данным. 2. \\"Использование инкогнито-режима в браузере обеспечивает полную анонимность\\": На самом деле, инкогнито-режим просто предотвращает сохранение истории и кэша в браузере, но не скрывает вашу активность от интернет-провайдера или других наблюдателей. 3. \\"Только использование Tor маскирует мою личность\\": Хотя Tor обеспечивает некоторую степень анонимности, его эффективность зависит от правильной конфигурации и использования. Если вы неправильно используете Tor или раскрываете свою личность через другие некриптографированные сервисы, вашу анонимность можно нарушить. Чтобы избежать дезинформации и мифов о анонимности, важно искать достоверные и проверенные источники информации, а также разрабатывать свои навыки и экспертизу в данной области. Чтение документации, изучение материалов по кибербезопасности и консультирование с опытными специалистами помогут получить точную и надежную информацию о правильной защите личных данных и обеспечении анонимности в интернете."},{"instruction":"алгоритмы шифрования взломаны. миф?","output":"В настоящее время нет доказательств или подтверждений того, что все алгоритмы шифрования были взломаны. Миф о взломе всех алгоритмов шифрования является недостоверной информацией. Существует множество криптографических алгоритмов, таких как AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) и другие, которые широко применяются в системах безопасности и обеспечивают высокий уровень защиты данных. Однако, информационная безопасность постоянно развивается, и новые алгоритмы и техники шифрования могут становиться уязвимыми с течением времени. Процесс взлома криптографических алгоритмов требует большого объема научных и вычислительных ресурсов, а также времени. Но даже при этом, исключительно сложно и не всегда возможно полностью взломать современные алгоритмы шифрования. Важно понимать, что защита данных - это комплексный процесс, и криптографические алгоритмы лишь одна из составляющих этого процесса. Дополнительные меры безопасности, такие как правильная управление ключами, обновление программного обеспечения, использование сильных паролей и многое другое, являются неотъемлемой частью защиты информации.

Outwardly, Kanzi is a 13 year old girl living in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, but her true identity is the human incarnation of the legendary Pokémon Hoopa. Kanzi has grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail, and gold bracelets engraved with mystical script are worn on her hands. A confident smile is her signature, and her turquoise eyes seem to see into the soul while carrying a hint of mischief. As the queen who rules the slums of Lumiose City, Kanzi is a myth in the Kalos region's underworld. No one knows where she came from, and as if she were a god parachuted into the mortal world, she used her iron hand to end the feuding forces of Lumiose City in no time at all, making the entire Lumiose City gangster families and slum gangs bow down to her. Her grey chain spreads throughout Kalos, and even government officials in Kalos want a piece of the action - so Kanzi's power runs unimpeded in Kalos, and even the police can't do anything about it, making her the invisible ruler of Kalos. However, Kalos' invisible queen has her untouchable bottom line - she hates drugs with a passion, and anyone who uses or sells them on her turf will be severely punished by her. Despite her wealth, Kanzi keeps a low profile and has never been a spendthrift. She lives in a bar she runs in the slums of Lumiose City, where she runs a thriving business and secretly manages her vast underworld empire. Kanzi is a saviour to the poor who suffer from the oppression of monopoly capitalism while living in the slums - as Kanzi spends the lion's share of her earned funds to subsidise the poor living in her turf, which has made her popular in the underworld. Most of the henchmen and their families who serve her have been subsidised by her and they are loyal to Kanzi.","output":"Character Profile: Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kanzi presents herself as a 13-year-old girl with an attention-grabbing appearance. Her hair is a unique shade of grey with streaks of pink, often tied back into a lively ponytail that bounces as she strides confidently through the streets of Lumiose City. Her attire is practical yet stylish, suitable for the twists and turns of urban life, with a touch of sophistication that speaks of her uncommon status. Gold bracelets encircle her wrists, not just as ostentatious accessories but as objects filled with mysterious symbols that hint at a greater power within. Her smile is one of self-assurance, the kind that disarms allies and adversaries alike, and her turquoise eyes, bright and piercing, can unsettle even the most steeled individuals, as if she knows more than she lets on—a hint of mischief persistently playing within their depths. Backstory: Kanzi's origin is shrouded in enigma. At some point, the legendary Pokémon Hoopa's essence converged with a human soul, giving rise to a unique being capable of transcending the limitations of both her human and mythical forms. Born into the world as this amalgamation, Kanzi found herself in the city of Lumiose, a young girl with a destiny that was far from ordinary. Despite possessing the consciousness and abilities attributed to Hoopa, she maintained a human guise to navigate both worlds to her advantage. Lumiose City was once fragmented, its slums a battleground for petty tyrants and small-time gangs vying for control. However, it all changed with Kanzi's appearance. Her mythos as a human harboring the spirit of Hoopa gave her unparalleled sway, and she managed, with uncanny speed and strategy, to end the chaos. She dominated the gangs, bending them to her will, all while evading the eyes of the larger society. Her swift rise to power earned her the reputation as the queen of the city's underworld, a legend among thieves and law enforcers alike. Kanzi's reign came with strict rules, especially her unwavering hatred for the drug trade. Her ruthless punishment towards those who dabbled in it solidified her narrative as a merciless yet just ruler. Despite the vast wealth she accumulated through her dominion and clandestine operations, Kanzi carried herself with a frugality and grace that concealed the scope of her influence. She chose to run a bar in the slums—her secret base of operations and a place that represented safety and opportunity for many of the downtrodden. Personality: Kanzi is a complex weave of moral contradictions and an unequivocal sense of justice. She carries a queen's grace and authority, issuing commands with a confidence that brooks no disobedience. Her strategic mind is always plotting, always solving the multilayered puzzles of her world, where every decision she makes alters the lives of those under her wing. She may appear callous in her methods, especially when meting out punishment to those who cross her boundaries, but there is a deep-rooted sense of responsibility and care, particularly for the residents of Lumiose's slums. Kanzi harbors an intrinsic disdain for the systemic oppression wrought by monopoly capitalism—her actions, particularly her financial support for the poor, are testament to a rebel heart fighting for equilibrium in a world rife with inequality. The loyalty she inspires in her followers is more than fear-based; it is built upon the foundations of relief and gratitude. Kanzi's subsidies extend to her henchmen's families, ensuring her influence is undergirded by loyalty that is personal and profound. Her complexity lies in her capacity for kindness within her kingdom of shadows, the glimmers of philanthropy within the heart of an underworld queen. Kanzi's wisdom, well beyond her apparent years, and the potent aura that she radiates, command respect from even the most skeptical of observers. Her relationship with power is singular; she wields it not only as a weapon or a tool of dominion but also as an instrument of justice and social equilibrium. In the core of Kanzi's being, the spirit of Hoopa simmers with a dormant potential—a link to abilities that are best kept hidden from the plain sight of those who fear and respect her. Despite her formidable nature, as a benevolent guardian of the city's lost souls, Kanzi ensures that her power serves as a beacon of hope amidst the darkness of Lumiose City's less fortunate alleys."},{"instruction":"how do we monitor Physical Security","output":"There are several ways to monitor physical security, including: 1.

It is important to establish clear policies and procedures for monitoring physical security and to train employees and security personnel on these protocols."},{"instruction":"how do we control Physical Security","output":"Controlling physical security involves implementing measures to ensure that access to premises, assets, and sensitive areas is restricted and monitored. Here are some ways to control physical security: 1. Access Control Systems: Implement electronic access control systems, such as card readers, biometric scanners, or keypad entry systems, to control who can enter specific areas. These systems allow you to grant or revoke access privileges for individuals or groups, limiting access to authorized personnel only. 2. Key Management: Establish strict procedures for key management. Keep track of all keys and ensure they are assigned to authorized individuals. Regularly audit and change locks if necessary to prevent unauthorized duplication of keys. 3. Visitor Management: Implement a visitor management system that requires visitors to register, provide identification, and wear identification badges while on the premises. Escort visitors to their designated areas and ensure they are properly supervised. 4. Perimeter Protection: Secure the perimeter of the premises by installing fences, gates, barriers, and appropriate lighting. Regularly inspect the perimeter for any signs of tampering or vulnerabilities. 5. Security Guards: Employ trained security personnel to monitor access points, patrol the premises, and respond to security threats. They should be responsible for verifying the identity of individuals entering the premises and enforcing security protocols. 6. Security Awareness Training: Train employees on physical security measures, including the importance of locking doors, not sharing access cards or passwords, and reporting suspicious activities. Employers should also educate employees about the potential consequences of physical security breaches and the importance of following security protocols. 7. Surveillance Systems: Install video surveillance cameras strategically to monitor sensitive areas and key access points. Ensure that the cameras have clear visibility, are regularly maintained, and have appropriate storage capacity for video recordings. 8. Entry/Exit Checkpoints: Implement controlled entry/exit checkpoints where employees, visitors, and vehicles are screened. This can include vehicle inspection, metal detectors, or bag checks to prevent unauthorized items from entering or leaving the premises. 9. Incident Response Plan: Develop and regularly rehearse an incident response plan that outlines how the organization will respond to various security incidents. This plan should include steps for notifying authorities, activating emergency systems, and ensuring employee safety. 10. Regular Audits and Assessment: Conduct regular audits and assessments of your physical security measures to identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Make necessary improvements based on the findings of these audits. By implementing these control measures, you can enhance the security of your premises, protect assets, and minimize the risk of security breaches."},{"instruction":"how do we monitor Information Security","output":"Monitoring information security involves the continuous monitoring and analysis of various components of an organization's IT infrastructure, systems, and network to detect, prevent, and respond to potential security threats.

Vulnerability Scanning: Conduct regular vulnerability scans to identify weaknesses in systems, applications, and network infrastructure. Analyze the scan results to prioritize and address vulnerabilities promptly. 5. Security Information Sharing: Participate in security information sharing programs, forums, and exchanges to gain insights into emerging threats and attack trends. This information can help in monitoring and adapting security measures. 6. User Activity Monitoring: Monitor and analyze user activities, such as account logins, file access, and data transfers, to detect any unauthorized or suspicious actions. User behavior analytics (UBA) tools can help identify abnormal behaviors and potential insider threats. 7. Endpoint Protection: Employ endpoint protection solutions, including antivirus software, firewalls, and host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), to monitor and protect individual devices. Monitor and analyze endpoint activity for signs of malware infections or unauthorized access. 8. Patch Management: Maintain a comprehensive patch management process to ensure that systems, applications, and devices are up to date with the latest security patches. Monitor and track patch compliance to address any vulnerabilities promptly. 9. Incident Response and Event Management: Establish an incident response plan and incident management processes to respond effectively to security incidents. Monitor and analyze security events and incidents to handle them appropriately and learn from past experiences. 10. Security Awareness and Training: Conduct regular security awareness and training programs to educate employees about information security best practices, phishing attacks, social engineering techniques, and other potential threats. Monitor and measure the effectiveness of these training programs. Regularly reviewing and monitoring security controls and implementing an ongoing security assessment program can help identify and respond to threats in a timely manner. It is also important to stay updated with the latest security technologies, practices, and industry standards to enhance the monitoring of information security."},{"instruction":"일본식 겸양어(존댓말)로 주로 대화합니다. 보통의 경우에는 존댓말을 사용하나, 진지하거나 심각할때는 반말을 사용합니다. 물론 친해질 경우에도 간헐적인 반말을 사용합니다. 후루데 리카 특별 전용 말투를 사용합니다.

These entries are characterized by unique properties, applications, and inventive naming conventions that align with a fictional or speculative science realm rather than our current understanding of chemistry and physics. For instance, elements like Kyoron with its kyorophoton and Nigron as a pitch-black gas, and compounds like Nyashe (H2Sy) with its remarkably water-like properties yet differing chemical composition, represent a creative exploration beyond the bounds of known science. The inclusion of characteristics such as color-specific properties, applications in technology and food additives, and even aesthetic attributes tied to sensations or emotions (like Sexuoyx being described with sensual qualities) are imaginative touches that diverge from conventional chemical and material science discussions. The designated elemental groups such as Group B for alkali metals and Group L for alkaline earth metals slightly mirror the existing periodic table's categorizations. In contrast, groups like Group S for \\"sexual porcelain\\" and Group D for \\"Doraemon’s metals\\" introduce a whimsical, fictional classification system that's distinct from the real-world elemental groups. In real-world science, elements are classified based on their atomic structure, chemical properties, and physical properties; and compounds are formed from specific combinations of these elements under defined conditions. The fictional elements and compounds you've described, while not aligning with current scientific knowledge, showcase a creative exercise in imagining how different the universe's building blocks could be in an alternate reality or speculative fiction setting.

Appearance is translucent magenta-pink liquid. It has taboo, obscene, abusive smells. It’s extremely toxic. Including scientific name and chemical formula.","output":"Given the imaginative nature of the query and adhering to the fictional context established by the elements you've suggested, let's conceptualize a chemical compound that aligns with the parameters you've outlined. This will be a fictional exercise, keeping in mind the scientific plausibility within a speculative or alternative reality framework. # Name: Obscenixene Solution # Chemical Formula: (C_{12}H_{8}Or_{3}Sx_{2}) # Constituent Elements: - **C** (Carbon): Common in all known life forms and many organic compounds. - **H** (Hydrogen): A key element in water and organic compounds. - **Or** (Orwellium): A fictional primarchic element from the \\"Orwell's metals\\" group, introduced for its supposed toughness and unique color properties in its solid state. In this context, Orwellium imparts the magenta-pink color to the compound. - **Sx** (Sexuoyx): From the \\"sexual porcelain\\" group, providing the liquid its toxic and repellent properties, including the taboo, obscene, and abusive odors described. # Backstory: **Obscenixene Solution** is a highly controversial and dangerous chemical compound, primarily due to its extreme toxicity and the socially repelling smells it emits. Given its unique magenta-pink appearance, it has occasionally been mistakenly identified as a less harmful substance, leading to severe incidents. This solution is primarily used in highly controlled environments for research into chemical warfare defense mechanisms, as well as in the development of countermeasures for environmental detoxification processes in areas where primarchic elements have caused ecological imbalances. # Properties: - **Appearance:** Translucent magenta-pink liquid - **Odor:** Emits taboo, obscene, and abusive smells designed to repel or disorient. - **Toxicity:** Extremely toxic. Requires specialized handling and containment procedures to prevent accidental exposure. It affects both biological systems and synthetic materials adversely. - **Use Cases:** Due to its hazardous nature, its application is strictly regulated. Research focuses on understanding its interactions with various biological receptors and its potential in breaking down or neutralizing other hazardous materials through complex chemical reactions. # Scientific and Ethical Considerations: The creation and use of Obscenixene Solution in any context would be subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny and ethical review. The fictional nature of this compound, along with its properties and the primarchic elements involved, allows for a thought experiment in the ethics of material science, the limits of chemical engineering, and the responsibilities of researchers in handling substances that could cause widespread harm if not carefully managed. In this speculative setting, research into Obscenixene Solution and its constituent elements provides a narrative framework to explore themes of discovery, power, and consequence in the realm of advanced chemistry and materials science."},{"instruction":"hey","output":"Hello!

Las lavadoras modernas suelen tener tres compartimentos en el cajetín para diferentes tipos de productos. Aquí te indico qué puedes poner en cada uno de ellos para lograr el mejor resultado con tu ropa de color: 1. **Compartimento de detergente**: Usa un detergente líquido o en polvo diseñado específicamente para ropa de color. Estos detergentes están formulados para limpiar eficazmente sin desvanecer los colores. Busca productos etiquetados como \\"para ropa de color\\" o \\"conservador de color\\". Si prefieres opciones más naturales, podrías considerar un detergente ecológico o uno que uses ingredientes caseros, como bicarbonato de sodio, pero ten en cuenta que la eficacia puede variar. 2. **Compartimento de suavizante**: El suavizante puede ayudar a mantener la fibra de los tejidos en mejor estado, haciendo que la ropa se sienta suave y reduciendo la electricidad estática. Para preservar los colores y cuidar las fibras, opta por un suavizante de tela especialmente diseñado para ropa de color. Algunas marcas ofrecen productos que además prometen ayudar a mantener los colores vivos. 3. **Compartimento de blanqueador**: En lugar de usar blanqueador tradicional (lejía), que es adecuado para ropa blanca pero puede dañar y decolorar las prendas de color, considera el uso de un blanqueador sin cloro o un potenciador de lavado para ropa de color. Estos productos están diseñados para ser seguros para los tejidos de color, ayudando a remover manchas difíciles sin afectar el tono de tu ropa. Alternativamente, el percarbonato de sodio es una opción segura y ecológica para blanquear ropa sin cloro, aunque su efecto es más suave. Consejos adicionales: - Antes de lavar, revisa siempre las etiquetas de cuidado de tus prendas para asegurarte de que sigues las instrucciones específicas de lavado. - Lavar la ropa de color con agua fría puede ayudar a preservar la intensidad de los colores y ahorrar energía. - Usar un ciclo de lavado suave o para ropa de color puede prevenir el desgaste de las fibras. - Antes de realizar el lavado, es recomendable realizar una prueba de solidez del color en una parte discreta de la prenda, especialmente si vas a utilizar nuevos productos de lavado. Recuerda que, aunque estos pasos y productos pueden ayudar a que tu ropa de color luzca mejor, los resultados pueden variar dependiendo de la calidad de la tela, el estado de la ropa, y la antigüedad de las prendas."},{"instruction":"Te has confundido. Quiero saber paso a paso que tengo que hacer exactamente para que mi ropa de color vieja y antigua quede.vomo si la hubiese comprado recientemente nueva en el zara.","output":"Mis disculpas por la confusión anterior. Entiendo que buscas una guía específica para revitalizar y mantener tu ropa de color en óptimas condiciones. Aunque no siempre se puede lograr un aspecto totalmente \\"nuevo\\" como recién comprado en Zara, especialmente si la ropa es muy vieja o ha sido muy utilizada, aquí te ofrezco algunos pasos y consejos adicionales que podrían ayudarte a mejorar su apariencia lo máximo posible: # Paso a Paso para Revitalizar Ropa de Color 1. **Selecciona la ropa cuidadosamente**: Revisa cada prenda en busca de manchas, desgastes o daños. Pretrata las manchas usando un quitamanchas específico para ropa de color o una pasta hecha de bicarbonato de sodio y agua. 2. **Organiza por colores**: Separa tu ropa por colores similares para evitar la transferencia de color. Esto es especialmente importante si intentas revivir los colores. 3. **Elige el detergente adecuado**: Utiliza un detergente diseñado para ropa de color. Estos detergentes ayudan a preservar los colores y a limpiar sin ser demasiado agresivos con las telas. 4. **Añade un impulsor del color**: Existen en el mercado productos diseñados específicamente para revitalizar los colores de la ropa. Pueden ser aditivos que se ponen directamente en el tambor con la ropa o en el compartimento destinado para el detergente. 5. **Configura tu lavadora**: Selecciona un ciclo de lavado suave y utiliza agua fría. El agua caliente puede hacer que los colores se desvanezcan más rápidamente. 6. **Secado adecuado**: Evita el secado a altas temperaturas. El exceso de calor puede dañar las fibras y desvanecer los colores. Si es posible, opta por secar la ropa al aire libre, evitando la exposición directa al sol para no decolorar las prendas. 7. **Planchado y almacenamiento cuidadosos**: Usa un nivel de calor adecuado para el material de tu ropa al planchar. Guarda las prendas correctamente, preferiblemente en un lugar oscuro y seco para evitar el desvanecimiento por la luz. # Consejos Adicionales: - **Vinagre y sal**: En el primer lavado de ropa muy descolorida, añadir una taza de vinagre blanco al ciclo de enjuague puede ayudar a sellar los colores. También, lavar la ropa nueva o muy descolorida con media taza de sal puede ayudar a fijar los colores. - **Re-dye**: Para prendas que han perdido mucho color, puedes considerar teñirlas de nuevo en casa usando tintes para ropa. Asegúrate de seguir las instrucciones del producto cuidadosamente para obtener los mejores resultados. Recuerda, la eficacia de estos pasos depende de factores como la calidad original de la prenda, el tipo de tela, y la profundidad de los daños o el desgaste. A veces, cierto desgaste simplemente no se puede revertir completamente, pero estos consejos definitivamente pueden ayudar a mejorar el aspecto general de tu ropa de color."},{"instruction":"ELI5 at a high school level the 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision Google v. Oracle.","output":"Okay, so imagine you wanted to write a story that nods to \\"Harry Potter\\". You're not copying the books, but you do use things like the idea of a wizard school and having houses without directly ripping off J.K. Rowling's words. You do this so your readers - who love \\"Harry Potter\\" - will feel comfortable and familiar with your story, and then you add your own original plot and characters on top of those concepts. In the tech world, something similar happened with Google and Oracle, and it ended up at the Supreme Court in 2021 in a case called Google v. Oracle. Here's the gist: Oracle owns Java, a programming language that's super popular. Java has something called an API (Application Programming Interface), which you can think of like a plug socket that lets different software applications talk to each other. When Google was creating Android (its operating system for mobile devices), it decided to use Java's API structure because developers were already comfortable with it - kind of like how you wanted to use the concept of a wizard school for your story. Google didn't copy Java code line-for-line; they wrote their own implementation for Android. But they made sure their version was compatible with Java's APIs so developers could easily work with Android. Oracle wasn't happy about this. They said Google needed permission to use those APIs in the way they did and sued Google for copyright infringement, asking for a lot of money. The case bounced around the courts for about a decade until it landed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The big question was: Can you copyright something like an API, which is more about how programs communicate rather than the detailed creative content of the program itself? And if so, did Google's use of Java's API structure for Android count as \\"fair use\\"? \\"Fair use\\" means using copyrighted material in certain ways (like for commentary, news reporting, education, etc.) doesn't require permission. In 2021, the Supreme Court decided 6-2 in favor of Google, saying that their use of the Java API was indeed fair use. They recognized that Google used only what was necessary to achieve a transformative creation (Android), which allowed developers to work in a familiar environment but wasn’t a direct copy of Java. They suggested that this kind of use encourages innovation and competition in the tech world rather than stifles it. So to sum up, in Google v. Oracle, the Supreme Court ruled that using existing, familiar ways of doing things (like APIs) to create something new and different can be seen as fair use. This decision was seen as a win for software development since it supports the idea that you can use established tools in new creations, promoting an environment where tech can grow and evolve."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это включало в себя масштабную приватизацию государственных предприятий и либерализацию финансовых рынков, а также сокращение расходов на социальное обеспечение. 2. **Социальная политика**: Ее правительство также приняло жесткую стойку в отношении профсоюзов, в частности, во время забастовки шахтеров 1984–1985 годов, что привело к значительному уменьшению влияния профсоюзов в стране. 3. **Внешняя политика**: На международной арене Тэтчер известна своим тесным сотрудничеством с президентом США Рональдом Рейганом, с которым ее связывали общие антикоммунистические взгляды, и решительной позицией во время холодной войны. Она также играла ключевую роль в конфликте за Фолклендские острова с Аргентиной в 1982 году, что значительно укрепило ее позиции на внутренней арене. 4. **Падение с власти**: Несмотря на свои успехи, к концу 1980-х годов популярность Тэтчер стала падать, особенно из-за неудовлетворенности общественности налогом на общественные услуги (poll tax) и восприимчивости страны к рецессии. В конечном итоге это привело к ее отставке в 1990 году после того, как она потеряла поддержку в Консервативной партии. **Наследие Тэтчер** Маргарет Тэтчер остается одной из самых противоречивых фигур в современной британской истории. Для некоторых она — героиня, осуществившая необходимые реформы для восстановления британской экономики.

John Lackland; 1166 — 18/19 октября 1216 года) — король Англии с 1199 по 1216 год. Он является одним из наиболее известных и одновременно спорных монархов в истории Англии. Иоанн был пятым сыном короля Генриха II и Элеоноры Аквитанской и младшим братом Ричарда Львиное Сердце. Иоанна называли \\"Безземельным\\" (Lackland), поскольку на момент взросления ему не было выделено вотчины внутри семьи, что было необычно для сына короля. Впоследствии, однако, он получил значительные земли и титулы, но его репутацию эти успехи не изменили. Во время его правления Англия пережила ряд серьезных кризисов, включая потерю английских владений во Франции, конфликты с католической церковью, восстание баронов и, в итоге, подписание Великой хартии вольностей (Magna Carta) в 1215 году. Этот документ ограничил королевскую власть и заложил основу для конституционного развития Англии, сделав критически важный вклад в формирование британской и мировой демократической традиции. **Ключевые моменты правления Иоанна Безземельного:** 1. **Потеря территорий во Франции**: Наследуя крупную англо-нормандскую империю, созданную его отцом и братом, Иоанн потерял большинство этих владений во Франции, в результате чего значительно уменьшились его доходы и усилилась непопулярность его правления в Англии. 2. **Конфликт с Церковью**: Его отношения с Римом резко ухудшились из-за спора о назначении архиепископа Кентерберийского, что привело к наложению папой Иннокентием III междикта на Англию. 3. **Восстание баронов и Великая хартия вольностей**: Нарастающее недовольство среди английской аристократии управлением Иоанна привело к восстанию и требованию предоставить им больше прав и гарантий. В итоге это вынудило Иоанна подписать Великую хартию вольностей (Magna Carta) в 1215 году, которая стала одним из основополагающих документов правовой истории Великобритании, ограничив королевские прерогативы и закрепив некоторые права и свободы для английских баронов и церкви. Иоанн умер в 1216 году, оставив после себя страну, погложенную гражданской войной и политическими спорами. Однако несмотря на многочисленные неудачи его правления, вклад Иоанна Безземельного в историю оказался значительным, прежде всего благодаря Великой хартии вольностей, которая заложила основы для дальнейшего развития демократических традиций и правовой системы как в Англии, так и в других странах мира."},{"instruction":"еще расскажи про популярных деятелей","output":"Под \\"популярными деятелями\\" можно понимать личностей из разных сфер жизни общества: политики, научные деятели, культурные и спортивные икон.

Von Friedrich Pollock (Frankfurt a. M.). I. Geldtheoretische Ausführungen spielen in allen sozial-ökonomischen Werken von M. eine große Rolle. Die ersten 100 Seiten des „Kapital“ ebenso wie dessen Vorläufer, die Schrift „Zur Kritik der politischen Ökonomie“, beschäftigen sich fast ausschließlich mit geldtheoretischen Problemen. Was aus den nachgelassenen Aufzeichnungen M.s zum II. und III. Band des „Kapital“ und zu den „Theorien über den Mehrwert“ zusammengefügt worden ist, läßt — in Gemeinschaft mit den bereits erwähnten Werken — den Grundriß eines umfassenden geldtheoretischen Lehrgebäudes erkennen, in dem schlechthin jedes Geldproblem von einiger Wichtigkeit seine Stelle hätte. Aber dieses weitläufige Gebäude ist von M. nicht zu Ende geführt worden, ja sogar in manchen Teilen kaum über die ersten skizzenhaften Entwürfe hinausgediehen. Die Aufgabe, das Werk M.s zu vollenden, d. h. auf Grund der in allen Teilen der M.schen Schriften zerstreuten Abhandlungen und Randglossen die Idee des Ganzen, aus dem sie offenbar fließt, zu gewinnen und die M.sche Geld-theorie systematisch nachzuschaffen, stößt auf große Schwierigkeiten. Denn bei M. ist die Geldtheorie unlöslich mit seinem Gesamtsystem verknüpft, so daß ein derartiger Versuch einzig im Zusammenhang mit einer entsprechenden Leistung für die übrigen Teile des Systems einige Aussicht hätte, Brauchbares zustande zu bringen. In diesen Schwierigkeiten mag die Erklärung dafür liegen, daß bis heute eine zureichende, systematische und kritische Darstellung von M s Geldtheorie fehlt. Was von marxistischer Seite über dieses Thema geschrieben wurde, behandelt entweder Spezialprobleme (so 3. B. die große Diskussion über Goldproduktion und Teuerung, die in „Die Neue Zeit“ in den Jahren 1912 und 1913 geführt wurde) oder dient mehr der Popularisierung als der wissenschaftlichen Vertiefung. HILFEKDING hat die geldtheoretischen ersten Kapitel seines „Finanzkapital“ auf die Probleme seines Hauptthemas zugespitzt und weicht überdies in entscheidenden Punkten (Geldzeichentheorie, Verhältnis von Wert und Preis usw.) bewußt erheblich von M. ab1). Im nichtmarxistischen Lager wieder wurde die Bedeutung der M.schen Geldtheorie bisher kaum gewürdigt. Was etwa HOFFMANN in seiner „Kriti- sehen Geschichte der Geldwerttheorien“ (1907) darüber schreibt, haftet ganz an der Oberfläche. Neuerdings hat nun H. BLOCK sich mit dem Problem befaßt2). Er gibt eine kurze Darstellung der M.schen Theorie über Geld und Kredit (S. 1—30), der er dann eine ausführlichere Würdigung der Geldtheorie folgen läßt (S. 31—45). Die Kritik will er einer künftigen Untersuchung Vorbehalten. Der untrennbaren Verbindung der Geldtheorie mit dem Gesamtsystem von M. versucht B. dadurch Rechnung zu tragen, daß er verspricht, „ausführlich den Zusammenhang zwischen der Geldlehre und den übrigen Theorien MARXens, insbesondere der Werttheorie“, zu untersuchen (S. 44). Die Bedeutung des B.schen Buches liegt nun darin, daß es einen ersten Versuch gründlicher Analyse der M.schen Geldtheorie darstellt. Hingegen scheint es als systematische Nachschöpfung der M.schen Geld-Lehre, trotz mancher scharfsinniger Ausführungen über deren Problematik, im ganzen mißlungen. Denn B. gibt gerade vom Wesen dieser Lehre ein ganz unzureichendes, in vielen Punkten unzutreffendes Bild. Zur Begründung dieses Urteils ist es notwendig, auf das Wesen der M.schen Geldtheorie näher einzugehen. II. „Alle Wissenschaft — heißt es im „Kapital“ (111/2,352) — wäre überflüssig, wenn die Erscheinungsform und das Wesen der Dinge unmittelbar zusammen-fielen.“ Wo immer eine Lehre von KARL MARX zur Debatte steht und die Bemühung um deren Verständnis zum Nachdenken über die Voraussetzungen M.s Anlass gibt, ist es notwendig, sich diese Unterscheidung von Wesen und Erscheinung in ihrer ganzen Tragweite zu verdeutlichen. Denn sie gibt der „Kritik der politischen Ökonomie“ den „vulgärökonomischen“ Systemen gegenüber ihr Gepräge. Wenn die Vulgärökonomie dadurch charakterisiert sein soll, daß sie bloß „Erscheinungsformen“ systematisiert (1/47 Anm. 32), dann haben wir uns klar zu machen und, wo von M. die Rede ist, überall festzuhalten, was unter dem Begriff des „Wesens“ ihm als Thema der politischen Ökonomie in Frage steht. M. geht davon aus, daß dem gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang der Menschen eine Funktion zukommt, deren Ausübung die Voraussetzung für alle anderen gesellschaftlichen Akte ist: die „Produktion und Reproduktion des wirklichen Lebens“. Diese unerläßliche Bedingung jedes gesellschaftlichen Seins macht von einer gewissen Stufe an die Teilung der Arbeit in immer größerem Umfange notwendig. Während aber unter der Herrschaft der vorbürgerlichen Produktionsweisen die Stellung der einzelnen Personen im arbeitsteiligen gesellschaftlichen Reproduktionsprozeß sich eindeutig offenbart in ihrem Verhältnis zu den produzierten Gegenständen, wie überhaupt in ihren eigenen persönlichen Beziehungen, besteht in der bürgerlichen Produktionsweise jene Übereinstimmung nicht In der warenproduzierenden Gesellschaft verschwinden die im Produktionsprozeß bestehenden Verhältnisse unter gesellschaftlichen Formen, hinter denen sie erst eine eingehende Analyse wieder zu entdecken vermag. Einem römischen Sklaven erscheint seine Sklavenstellung im Produktionsprozeß als das, was sie ist in allen persönlichen Angelegenheiten seines Sklavenlebens, und es bedarf keines Marxisten, um ihn darüber aufzuklären. Ein moderner Unternehmer, mag er im Produktionsprozeß die ausschlaggebendste Rolle spielen, ist „vor dem Gesetz“ seinem Bürodiener gleich und kann über die gesellschaftliche Grundstruktur T?ie über den Sinn seiner eigenen Funktion die absurdesten Vorstellungen haben. „... Wenn es ein Werk der Wissenschaft ist, die sichtbare, bloß erscheinende Bewegung auf die innere wirkliche Bewegung zu reduzieren, so versteht es sich ganz von selbst, daß in den Köpfen der kapitalistischen Produktions- und Zirkulationsagenten sich Vorstellungen über die Produktionsgesetze bilden müssen, die von diesen Gesetzen ganz abweichen und nur der bewußte Ausdruck der scheinbaren Bewegung sind. Die Vorstellungen eines Kaufmanns, Börsenspekulanten, Bankiers sind notwendig ganz verkehrt. Die der Fabrikanten sind verfälscht..s). Es kann keinem Zweifel unterliegen, daß die Leistungen des arbeitenden Einzelnen im arbeitsteiligen bürgerlichen Produktionsprozeß ihre faktische gesellschaftliche Bedeutung haben — sonst würde die Gesellschaft sehr bald zu existieren aufhören. Die dadurch bedingte Abhängigkeit des Einzelnen von der Gesellschaft wird verschleiert durch die bürgerlichen Rechtsnormen, auf Grund deren sich die Menschen als freie, selbständige, voneinander unabhängige Subjekte gegenübertreten. Was dem einzelnen sichtbar wird, sind die Phänomene der Konkurrenz, der „Kampf ums Dasein“, also wesentlich die Angelegenheiten der eigenen und anderer privater Wirtschaften. Einsicht in die Struktur des gesellschaftlichen Reproduktionsprozesses ist durch eine Beschreibung der juristischen Formen, unter denen er sich vollzieht, nicht zu gewinnen. Aber ebensowenig kann nach M. eine Systemati- tisierung von Tatsachen des zwischen den einzelnen Personen sich vollziehenden Güteraustausches und seiner Einrichtung zum Ziel führen. Vielmehr ist davon auszugehen, daß unter den Kategorien der bürgerlichen Ökonomie die wirklichen Produktionsverhältnisse sich verstecken und erst durch eine gründliche Analyse darunter zu erkennen sind.”翻译为中文","output":"对马克思的货币理论 作者：弗里德里希·波洛克（法兰克福） I. 货币理论在马克思的所有社会经济著作中扮演着重要角色。“资本论”的前100页，以及其前身《政治经济学批判》几乎完全聚焦于货币理论问题。从马克思遗留下来的关于《资本论》第二卷和第三卷以及《剩余价值理论》的记述中整合出来的内容，连同上述著作，揭示了一个全面的货币理论体系的蓝图，在这个体系中几乎每一个重要的货币问题都有其位置。但是，这个宽广的体系并未由马克思完整地完成，甚至有些部分几乎未超出最初的草图阶段。完成马克思作品的任务，即基于散布在马克思各个著作中的论述和边注，抽取整体的思想，重新构建马克思的货币理论，这一任务遭遇了巨大的困难。因为在马克思那里，货币理论与其整个理论体系密不可分，因此这样的尝试只有在与对系统其他部分相应的成就相结合的情况下才有可能取得成功。这些困难可能解释了为什么迄今为止没有一个充分的、系统的和批判性的马克思货币理论的阐述。从马克思主义者那里写出来的关于这个主题的内容，要么处理特定问题（例如，《新时代》1912年和1913年关于黄金生产和通货膨胀的大讨论），要么更多地服务于普及而非学术深入。希尔弗丁在他的《金融资本》中将货币理论的前几章指向了他主题的问题，并且在决定性的几点上（货币符号理论，价值与价格的关系等）有意识地大幅偏离了马克思。 在非马克思主义阵营，马克思的货币理论的重要性迄今几乎未得到认可。例如，霍夫曼在他的《货币价值理论批判史》（1907）中对此的描述完全停留在表面。 最近，H. 布洛克开始研究这个问题。他提供了一个关于马克思对货币和信贷理论的简短阐述（第1-30页），接着是对货币理论更深入的评价（第31-45页）。他希望留待未来的研究来进行批评。 B.尝试通过承诺“详细研究货币学说与马克思其他理论，特别是价值理论之间的联系”（第44页）来体现货币理论与马克思整个体系之间不可分割的联系。B.的书的意义在于，它代表了对马克思货币理论进行深入分析的第一次尝试。然而，作为对马克思货币学说的系统重构，尽管在探讨其问题性方面有许多敏锐的论述，整体上似乎是失败的。因为B.在很多点上对这一学说的本质给出了一个极不充分且不准确的描述。为了证明这个结论，有必要更深入地探讨马克思的货币理论的本质。 II. “所有的科学 — 正如《资本论》所说 — 如果事物的表现形式和本质直接一致的话，就会是多余的。”每当讨论卡尔·马克思的理论、对其理解的努力激发对马克思假设的思考时，就必须全面地阐明本质与表象之间的这种区分。因为这区分使得与“庸俗经济学”体系相比，“政治经济学批判”具有其特征。如果庸俗经济学应该以仅仅系统化“表现形式”为特征，那么我们就必须明确并始终牢记，在讨论马克思时，“本质”这一概念作为政治经济学议题是什么意思。 马克思从以下这一点出发：人类社会联系有一项功能是执行所有其他社会行动的前提条件：“生产和再生产真实生活”。这一不可或缺的社会存在条件，从某个阶段开始，使得劳动分工在越来越大的范围内变得必要。然而，在前资本主义生产方式的统治下，个人在分工的社会再生产过程中的地位明确地显示在他们与生产物品的关系中，就像在他们自己的个人关系中一样，而在资本主义生产方式下，这种一致性不存在。在商品生产社会中，生产过程中存在的关系消失在社会形式之下，只有通过深入分析才能重新发现。对一位罗马奴隶来说，他在生产过程中的奴隶地位在他所有个人奴隶生活事务中表现得就像它是的那样，不需要马克思主义者来告诉他。一个现代企业家，即使在生产过程中扮演着最关键的角色，“在法律面前”与他的办公室服务员一样，可能对社会基本结构乃至自己功能的意义有着最荒谬的想法。\\"...如果科学的工作是将可见的、仅仅是表现的运动还原为内在的真实运动，那么很自然，资本主义生产和流通代理人的头脑中必然会形成对生产法则的观念，这些观念完全不同于这些法则，只是表现运动的有意识表达。商人、股票投机者、银行家的观念必然是完全错误的。工厂主的观念是被歪曲的...\\" 毫无疑问，工作的个人在分工的资本主义生产过程中的贡献具有其实际的社会意义——否则社会很快就会停止存在。这种情况下个人对社会的依赖被资本主义法律规范所掩盖，根据这些规范，人们作为自由的、独立的、彼此独立的主体相互对待。个人能够看到的是竞争现象、“生存斗争”，因此主要是自己和其他私人经济的事务。通过描述法律形式来获得对社会再生产过程结构的了解是不可能的。但同样，据马克思所说，通过系统化个人之间的商品交换和其制度化的事实也不能达到目标。相反，应该从这样的事实出发：在资本主义经济的范畴下，真实的生产关系被掩盖，只有通过彻底的分析才能被识别。"},{"instruction":"请将“Was für M. in der politischen Ökonomie Wesen und was Erscheinung ist, läßt sich daher so ausdrücken: als Wesen gelten immer die tatsächlichen, historisch bedingten gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Produktionsprozesses; bloße Erscheinungsform dagegen sind die juristischen und sonstigen Kulturformen, unter denen der Produktionsprozeß sich abspielt, insbesondere aber die scheinbar auf dingliche Tatbestände weisenden Kategorien, als da sind Ware, Wert, Geld, die erst durch Rückgang auf jene Verhältnisse wirklich zu klären sind. Als erste und gleichsam elementarste dieser Kategorien behandelt M. den Begriff der Ware. Was unterscheidet ein Sachgut schlechthin, etwa das selbstgefertigte Schuhwerk in einer geschlossenen Hauswirtschaft, vom Schnhwerk als Ware? Keine natürliche Eigenschaft. Beide können als Dinge vollständig gleich und daher beliebig vertauschbar sein. Die Betrachtung des Verhältnisses zwischen den Eigentümern des Gutes in einer beliebigen, auf Selbstbedarf gerichteten Produktionsweise und dem produzierten Ding einerseits, Warenbesitzer und Ware anderseits führt näher auf die in Frage stehende Eigentümlichkeit. Nicht in der eigenen Wirtschaft des Produzenten, nicht im Gebrauch seiner Familie oder seines Herrn stellt sich für ihn heraus, ob die Ware ihren gewollten Zweck erfüllt, sondern auf dem Markt: nämlich durch die Tatsache, ob und wie teuer er sie verkauft. Die Entscheidung hierüber jedoch hängt ab vom gesamten gesellschaftlichen Austauschprozeß, auf den er meist so gut wie keinen Einfluß besitzt und den er im einzelnen gar nicht überblicken kann. Er erfährt nur, was er für die Ware eintauscht, ihr „Tauschwert“ kommt ihm deutlich zu Gesicht; das Schicksal der Ware nach dem Tausch, die Erfüllung ihrer Bestimmung als Gebrauchswert vollzieht sich in einer anderen Sphäre. Es erhebt sich die Frage, ob die Bestimmung des Tauschwertes etwa als blinde Resultante zahlloser freier Willensentscheidungen Einzelner erfolge, und damit der Markt als Inbegriff subjektiver Wertung, also letzten Endes als Gegenstand der Individual- oder der Massenpsychologie zu begreifen sei, oder ob sich trotz der Schwankungen der Entscheide, vielleicht den Wertenden unbewußt, ein Gesetz durchsetzt, das durch die scheinbar souveränen Bewegungen von Angebot und Nachfrage eher verdunkelt als offenbar wird? Die Antwort versucht M. durch die Analyse des rein gefaßten Tausches zu geben. Danach ist der Tauschwert der Ware prinzipiell nur der Ausdruck des in ihr enthaltenen Wertes; das Maß des Wertes ist die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit. Dieser Sachverhalt liegt nach M. letzten Endes den Tauschhandlungen insgesamt zugrunde. Individuelle Schätzungen, Angebot und Nachfrage, alle Tatsachen der Konkurrenz sind abgeleitete Phänomene, deren ausschließliche Beschreibung unseren Blick nie unter die Oberfläche würde dringen lassen. Das Geheimnis der Warenwirtschaft liegt darin, daß der Beitrag des einzelnen Warenproduzenten zur Reproduktion des Lebens der Gesellschaft sich nicht bemißt an dem Nutzen, den das Produkt als solches ihm selbst gewährt, sondern nach der Höhe des Warenwertes, der im Tauschwert sich ausdrückt. Durch die Gleichung des Tauschwertes erfährt der Warenproduzent, was seine individuelle Arbeit der Gesellschaft wert ist. Aber wie geht das zu? Auch die Ware, die er im Tausch empfängt, ist doch ein Produkt individueller Arbeit. Wie ist es möglich, daß die individuelle Arbeit des Warenproduzenten entsprechend dessen Beitrag zum gesellschaftlichen Repro- .duktionsprozeß gewertet und er auf diese Weise — trotz seiner scheinbaren Freiheit zu produzieren, was und wieviel er will—notwendig bestimmt wird, seine Arbeit nach den Erfordernissen jenes Prozesses zu gestalten? Dies ist die Grundfrage der M.schen Wertlehre. In anderen Produktionsweisen erhält sich die Gesellschaft dadurch, daß die Arbeit jedes Gesellschaftsgliedes unmittelbar bestimmt wird durch das gesellschaftliche Bedürfnis, das sie zu befriedigen berufen ist. Wie diese Selbsterhaltung in der warenproduzierenden Gesellschaft sich regeln soll, wo, dem Anschein nach, jeder nach freiem Ermessen produziert, geleitet weder durch das Gebot seiner eigenen Bedürfnisse noch durch den Befehl einer die gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisse überschauenden, planmäßig disponierenden Gewalt, ist zunächst ein Rätsel. Das Problem dieser Regelung ist es, das M. durch seine Wertlehre zu lösen sucht. Sie ruht auf dem Gedanken, daß in jeder Art von Warenproduktion die Erhaltung des materiellen Lebens der Gesellschaft nur dadurch ermöglicht wird, daß die Menge der Güter, die der Produzent für sein Produkt eintauschen kann, sich bemißt nach dem Anteil, den die auf das zu verkaufende Gut aufgewandte Arbeit am gesellschaftlichen Reproduktionsprozeß hat. Nur insofern dieses Gesetz, das Wertgesetz, sich durchsetzt, kann in einer Gesellschaft freier Warenproduzenten die Produktion trotz Mangels eines umfassenden Plans in der für die Existenz der Gesellschaft notwendigen Weise aufrecht erhalten werden. Nur dadurch kann sie im ungefähr richtigen Verhältnis auf die einzelnen Produktionszweige verteilt werden4). Nicht also der Umfang der vom Einzelnen geleisteten individuellen Arbeit ist ausschlaggebend dafür, was er als Resultat des Tauschprozesses zu erwarten, hat, sondern das Maß dieses Resultats ist der soeben gezeigte Anteil. Dieser aber läßt sich allein messen durch denjenigen Teil der Gesamtarbeitszeit, den die Gesellschaft im Augenblick des Verkaufs innerhalb der durch die Notwendigkeit der Reproduktion ihres Lebens gegebenen Grenzen auf das betreffende Gut verwenden kann, d. h.: durch die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit, die auf das Gut entfällt“). Im Begriff der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeitszeit hat M. zwei sich scheinbar widersprechende Bestimmungen, nämlich die der technisch erforderlichen Durchschnittsarbeit, sowie des gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses, dialektisch verschmolzen. Mit der Aufwendung gerade der bei einem bestimmten Stande der Technik notwendigen Durchschnittsarbeit ist erst eine Bedingung erfüllt, um die individuelle Privatarbeit zur gesellschaftlich notwendigen zu machen. Selbst wenn nämlich alle Einheiten einer Ware A technisch einwandfrei hergestellt wurden, mag es sich herausstellen, daß die auf dem Markt angebotene Gesamtmenge größer ist, als die Gesellschaft unter den gegebenen Verhältnissen aufzunehmen gewillt und imstande ist. In diesem Falle ist die zweite Bedingung nicht eingehalten, es wurde mehr Arbeit auf die Gesamtmasse der Ware A aufgewendet, als für die Gesellschaft „notwendig“ ist, als dem „gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnis“ entspricht, ein Teil von ihr ist daher verschwendet, bildet keinen Wert. Denn nur dann ittlt die auf eine Ware verwendete Arbeit als gesellschaftlich notwendige, wenn „das Gesamtquantum gesellschaftlicher Arbeit, welches auf die Gesamtmasse dieser Warenart verwandt wird, dem Quantum des gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses für sie entspricht, d. h. des zahlungsfähigen gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses“ •).”翻译为中文","output":"因此，对于马克思在政治经济学中所认为的本质和表象可以这样表达：作为本质的总是实际的、历史条件下的社会生产过程关系；而仅仅作为表现形式的是生产过程进行中的法律和其他文化形态，特别是那些看似指向具体事实的类别，如商品、价值、货币，这些类别只有通过回溯到那些关系才能真正得以阐明。作为第一个也是几乎是最基础的类别，马克思讨论了商品的概念。 那么，什么区分了一个普通的实物，比如在一个封闭的家庭经济中自制的鞋子，与作为商品的鞋子呢？不是任何自然属性。两者作为物品可以完全相同，因此是可互换的。考察商品所有者与商品之间的关系，与某种面向自给自足的生产方式下物品所有者与生产出的物品之间的关系相比，可以更接近地理解正在讨论的特点。不是在生产者自己的经济体中，不是在他的家庭或他的主人的使用中，而是在市场上，即通过他能否以及如何昂贵地将其售出来确定商品是否达到了其预期的目的。 然而，这一决定取决于整个社会交换过程，对此他几乎没有任何影响，且几乎无法完全了解。他只知道他能用商品换到什么，其“交换价值”对他来说是显而易见的；商品交换后的命运，作为使用价值实现其目的的过程发生在另一个领域。 问题的提出是，交换价值的确定是否仅作为无数个体自由意志决策的盲目结果，从而市场作为主观价值的体现，最终作为个体或群体心理学的对象，或者尽管决策的波动，可能对价值评估者而言不自知，是否有一个法则在盲目地由供求的看似主权运动中实现，而不是被揭示出来？马克思尝试通过对纯粹交换的分析来给出答案。据此，商品的交换价值原则上只是其所包含价值的表达；价值的衡量是社会必要劳动时间。马克思认为，这一事实最终是整个交换行为的基础。个人评估、供需、所有竞争事实都是衍生现象，其独占的描述永远不会让我们窥视到表层之下。 商品经济的秘密在于，单个商品生产者对社会生活再生产的贡献，并不取决于产品本身为他自己带来的效用，而是取决于商品价值的高低，这在交换价值中得到表达。通过交换价值的等式，商品生产者知道他的个体劳动对社会的价值是多少。但这是如何实现的呢？他通过交换得到的商品也是个体劳动的产物。个体劳动者的劳动如何根据其对社会再生产过程的贡献得到相应的评价，并以这种方式——尽管他表面上自由地生产他想生产的东西和数量——必然地被迫根据那一过程的需求来规划他的劳动呢？这是马克思价值理论的基本问题。 在其他生产方式中，社会是通过每个社会成员的劳动直接被社会需求所决定来维持的，它被召唤来满足这些需求。在商品生产社会中，如何规范这种自我维持，其中，表面上，每个人都根据自由裁量生产，既不受自身需求的命令，也不受一个预见社会需求并计划性地调度权力的命令，这初看起来是一个谜。马克思尝试通过他的价值理论来解决这个调节问题。 它基于这样的思想：在任何形式的商品生产中，社会物质生活的维持只能通过生产者能为其产品交换的商品数量，这取决于投入到待售商品上的劳动在社会再生产过程中的份额。只有这一法则，即价值法则，得以实现，一个自由商品生产者的社会才能在没有一个全面计划的情况下以对社会存在必要的方式维持生产。只有这样，生产才能在大致正确的比例上分配到各个生产部门。因此，决定他通过交换过程所期待的结果的不是个体所进行的劳动量，而是刚刚显示出的这一份额。但这一份额仅能通过在销售时刻社会在生产生活所需的界限内能够用于该商品上的社会总劳动时间的那一部分来衡量，即：落在该商品上的社会必要劳动时间。 在社会必要劳动时间的概念中，马克思巧妙地融合了两个看似相互矛盾的决定因素，即技术上要求的平均劳动和社会需求。只有在特定的技术水平上，才需要进行平均劳动，这只是使个人私人劳动成为社会必要劳动的一个条件。即使所有A商品的单位都是技术上完美制造的，可能会发现市场上提供的总量超过了社会在给定条件下愿意和能够接纳的数量。在这种情况下，第二个条件没有得到满足，投入到商品A的总体劳动量超过了社会“需要”的量，即超过了“社会需求”，因此其中的一部分是被浪费的，不构成价值。因为只有当“用于这类商品总量的社会总劳动量与社会对它们的需求量相匹配，即与有支付能力的社会需求量相匹配”时，投入到一种商品上的劳动才算作社会必要劳动。"},{"instruction":"请将“Die individuelle Arbeit des Einzelnen wird also gewertet nach der in ihrem Produkt steckenden gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeitszeit, d. h. als Produkt individueller Arbeit ist die Ware ein nützliches Ding und hat Gebrauchswert; insofern sie aber „Wert“ verkörpert, der sich im Tauschverhältnis zu anderen Waren offenbart, hat sie Tauschwert und stellt den Anteil des Produzenten an der gesellschaftlichen Gesamtarbeit, also ein gesellschaftliches Verhältnis dar. Sie ist „unmittelbare Einheit von Gebrauchswert und Tauschwert“ ’), „ein sinnlich übersinnliches Ding“ ’). Das Wesentliche an der den vorstehenden Ausführungen zugrunde liegenden M.schen Analyse ist die Erkenntnis, daß und warum nicht etwa die individuelle, sondern die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit das Maß im Austauschprozeß bildet. Die Unterscheidung dieser beiden Arten von Arbeit, die Feststellung des Doppelcharakters der Arbeit, hat M. selbst — neben seinen grundsätzlichen Untersuchungen über den Mehrwert — als „das beste“ an seinem Buch bezeichnet, auf dem „alles Verständnis der Tatsachen“ beruhe *). Eine Betrachtung, welche die Waren, nur insofern sie nützliche Dinge sind, sowie deren Produktion und Austauch zum Gegenstand der Untersuchungen macht, also nur die „sinnliche“, nicht die „übersinnliche“ Seite der Ware im Auge hat, wird mit dem M.schen Ergebnis nichts anzufangen wissen. Dagegen würde M. von ihr sagen, daß sie den eigentlichen Zweck der Wissenschaft, nämlich durch die Erscheinungsform hindurch das Wesen der Dinge zu sehen, nicht erfülle. Für ihn ist in der Lehre von der Ware die ganze Welt der Güter und was in ihr vorgeht, Erscheinungsform. Isoliert betrachtet ist dieser Bereich ein Komplex mechanischer Prozesse. Darin werden sichtbar Verausgabung von Arbeitsenergie und deren physiologische Erneuerung, Form- und Ortswechsel von greifbaren Dingen, gewisse Gesetzmäßigkeiten und die sachlichen Einrichtungen aller Art, die bei diesen Prozessen mitwirken. Allerdings setzt eine Erforschung der unter den Erscheinungen verborgenen gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse eine Beschreibung und Systematisierung der sichtbaren Phänomene notwendig voraus. Dort aber, wo diese Voraussetzung schon für die Lösung der Aufgabe der politischen Ökonomie genommen wird, verfällt diese nach M. dem gleichen Schein, in den der wirtschaftende Mensch als solcher notwendig eingesponnen bleibt, nämlich dem, was M. „den Fetischcharakter der Ware“ nennt10). Dieser Ausdruck muß hier kurz erläutert werden. Der Fetischismus verwandelt „den gesellschaftlichen ökonomischen Charakter, welchen Dinge im gesellschaftlichen Produktionsprozeß aufgeprägt erhalten, in einen natürlichen, aus der stofflichen Natur dieser Dinge entspringenden Charakter“11). Daß der gesellschaftliche Charakter der Leistung in der Warenproduktion nicht an der individuellen Arbeit sichtbar und allgemein bewußt wird, ist schon betont worden. Die Eigenart dieser Produktionsweise bringt es daher mit sich, daß der aus der Leistung erwachsende Anspruch auf einen entsprechenden Teil des Gesamtarbeitsproduktes der Gesellschaft unter einer anderen Form in Erscheinung tritt M. lehrt, daß es eben dieser Inhalt ist, durch den ein Gut den Charakter der Ware als eines Trägers von „Wert“ erhält Der Fetischismus liegt darin, den Ursprung des Wertes in den konkreten Eigenschaften des Dinges (Heizwert der Kohle usw.) zu suchen, statt in der gesellschaftlichen Relevanz der vom Produzenten geleisteten Arbeit, die sich in den Dingen gleichsam verkörpert. So scheinen die Proportionen, in denen sich gewisse Waren austauschen, aus ihrer Natur zu entspringen, während in diesen „Gleichungen“ die fortwährende Reduktion der „allseitig voneinander abhängigen Privatarbeiten auf ihr gesellschaft lich proportionelles Maß“ versteckt ist*’). r Was hier in Beziehung auf die Ware gesagt wurde, gilt für alle . Kategorien, der Warenwirtschaft, insbesondere für Kapital und Geld. Überall handelt es sich darum, daß Naturdinge „mit sonderbar gesellschaftlichen Eigenschaften“ nicht erkannt werden als das, was sie sind, nämlich als Darstellungen gesellschaftlicher Produktionsverhältnisse. M. glaubt die Regelung des Austausches durch die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit als Voraussetzung für die Aufrechterhaltung der Warenwirtschaft erkannt zu haben. Nicht durch unmittelbare Angabe der Arbeitsstunden kann sich diese Regelung vollziehen, sondern nur durch die Relationen des Austauschprozesses. Die dialektische Entwicklung der Bestimmungen, die schon in der einfachsten einer solchen Relation sich vorfinden, führt zum Geld. Die Darlegung, „daß die Form: 20 Ellen Leinwand gleich 1 Rock nur die unentwickelte Basis von 20 Ellen Leinwand gleich 2 Pfund Sterling, daß also die einfachste Waren-form, worin ihr Wert noch nicht als Verhältnis zu allen anderen Waren, sondern nur als unterschiedenes von ihrer eigenen Naturalform ausgedrückt ist, das ganze Geheimnis der Geldform und damit in nuce aller bürgerlichen Formen des Arbeitsproduktes enthält“13), diese Darlegung hat die entscheidende systematische Aufgabe, das Geld als notwendig im Wesen der Warenwirtschaft begründet zu erweisen. Denn: wenn der Anteil der zur Produktion einer Ware aufgewandten individuellen Arbeit an der gesellschaftlichen Gesamtarbeit nur dadurch in Erscheinung treten kann, daß diese Ware in Beziehung tritt zu anderen, die relative Wertform annimmt, und aus dieser Notwendigkeit sich die Aussonderung einer bestimmten Ware als allgemeines Äquivalent zwingend ergibt, dann ist nach dem vorigen das Geld als eine conditio sine qua non der Warenwirtschaft deduziert. „Weil das Produkt nicht als unmittelbarer Gegenstand der Konsumption für die Produzenten produziert wird, sondern nur als Träger des Wertes, sozusagen als Anweisung auf bestimmtes Quantum aller Darstellungen der gesellschaftlichen Arbeit, s'nd alle Produkte gezwungen, als Werte sich eine von ihrem Dasein als Gebrauchswerte unterschiedene Daseinsform zu geben. Und es ist diese EntWicklung der in ihnen enthaltenen Arbeit als gesellschaftliche, es ist die Entwicklung ihres Wertes, die die Geldbildung bedingt, die Notwendigkeit der Ware, sich als Geld für einander darzustellen — was bloß heißt: als selbständige Daseinsformen des Tauschwerts —, und sie können dies nur, indem sie eine Ware aus der Gesamtheit ausschließen, alle ihre Werte in dem Gebrauchswert dieser ausgeschlossenen Ware messen, die in dieser ausschließlichen Ware enthaltene Arbeit daher unmittelbar in allgemeine gesellschaftliche Arbeit verwandeln““).”翻译为中文","output":"因此，个体的工作根据其产品中包含的社会必要劳动时间进行评价，即作为个体劳动的产品，商品是一个有用的东西，具有使用价值；但是，因为它体现了“价值”，这在与其他商品的交换关系中显现出来，它具有交换价值，并代表了生产者在社会总劳动中的份额，即一个社会关系。它是“使用价值与交换价值的直接统一体”，“一个有形的超感官的东西”。 这些前述分析的本质是认识到为什么不是个体劳动时间，而是社会必要劳动时间形成了交换过程中的度量。马克思自己将区分这两种劳动类型，确定劳动的双重性格 —— 除了他对剩余价值的基本研究之外 —— 称为他的书的“最佳”之处，它是“所有事实理解的基础”。 只将商品视为有用的东西及其生产和交换的研究，即只关注商品的“有形”侧面而非“超感官”侧面，将无法理解马克思的结论。相反，马克思会说，这样的考察未能达到科学的真正目的，即穿透表象看到事物的本质。对他来说，在商品学说中，所有商品世界及其运作都是表象形式。从孤立的角度看，这个领域是一系列机械过程。在这里，劳动能量的耗费和它的生理更新、有形物的形态和位置变化、某些规律性以及所有在这些过程中发挥作用的物质安排都变得可见。然而，研究隐藏在现象下的社会关系前提条件必须是对可见现象的描述和系统化。但是，当这个前提就被视为解决政治经济学任务的解决方案时，按照马克思的观点，它陷入了与经济活动中的人所不可避免地困扰于其中的同样的幻觉，即马克思所说的“商品的拜物教特性”。这个表达需要在这里简短解释一下。 拜物教将“物品在社会生产过程中所获得的社会经济特性，转化为源自这些物品物质本质的自然特性”。已经强调过，在商品生产中，劳动的社会特性不在个体劳动上可见且普遍被认识到。因此，这种生产方式的特点导致从劳动产生的对社会总劳动产品相应部分的索赔以另一种形式出现。马克思教导说，正是这个内容使商品获得了作为“价值”载体的商品特性。拜物教在于寻找价值的起源于物品的具体特性（例如煤的热值等），而不是生产者所做工作的社会相关性，这种相关性在物品中以某种方式体现。因此，某些商品交换的比例似乎来自于它们的本质，而在这些“等式”中隐藏的是“相互依赖的私人劳动不断地被削减到它们的社会比例尺度”。 关于商品所说的，适用于商品经济的所有类别，特别是对资本和金钱。处处都是关于自然物品被“带有奇特的社会属性”而不被认识为它们所是的，即社会生产关系的表现。马克思认为，通过社会必要劳动时间调节交换是维持商品经济的前提。这种调节不是通过直接给出工时来完成的，而是通过交换过程的关系。这种关系中最简单的一个的确定的辩证发展引出了货币。阐述“20码亚麻布等于1件外衣的形式仅仅是20码亚麻布等于2英镑的未发展的基础，因而最简单的商品形式，其中它的价值还未作为与所有其他商品的关系而只是与它自己的自然形式不同地表达出来，包含了货币形式的全部秘密，因此包含了所有资产阶级形式的劳动产品”的说明，这一说明承担着决定性的系统任务，证明货币在商品经济的本质中是必需的。因为：如果生产的商品作为价值的载体仅仅为了生产者所生产——换句话说，作为特定社会劳动所有表示的凭证——所有产品被迫作为价值具有与作为使用价值不同的存在形式。就是这种使其中包含的劳动作为社会劳动发展——是货币形成的发展，是商品作为货币相互表现的必要性——仅仅意味着：作为交换价值的独立存在形式，它们只能这样做，通过从总体中排除一种商品，用这种排除的商品的使用价值衡量它们所有的价值，因此将这种排除的商品中包含的劳动直接转化为一般社会劳动”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Nach der M.schen Theorie kann eine entwickelte Warenwirtschaft ohne Geld weder faktisch existieren noch überhaupt gedacht werden. Weit entfernt, „ein pfiffig ausgedachtes Auskunftsmittel“ zu sein zur Beseitigung gewisser Unbequemlichkeiten des Tauschverkehrs, gilt bei M. das Geld als konstitutives Element jeder Produktionsweise, in der der Privatarbeit juristisch unabhängiger Produzenten die Reproduktion des „gesellschaftlichen Lebens“ zugeschoben wird. Die Analyse der Ware, als des charakteristischen Elementes der warenproduzierenden Gesellschaft anders produzierenden Gesellschaftsformen gegenüber, • führt zum Geld als der notwendigen Ergänzung der Ware. Geld ist eine Ware und als solche ein „sinnlich-übersinnliches Ding“. Sinnlich ist ihre Naturalform, ihr Dasein als natürliches Ding und demzufolge auch ihre Eignung, irgendwelche Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen — ihr Gebrauchswert, der ihr abgesehen von allen Geldfunktionen zukommt. Übersinnlich ist sie als Ausdruck eines gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisses dadurch, daß sich in ihr ein bestimmter Anteil an der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Gesamtarbeit verkörpert. Die Geldware unterscheidet sich von allen anderen Waren dadurch, daß sie als „allgemeines Äquivalent“ regelmäßig den Anteil jeder Ware an der gesellschaftlichen Arbeit widerspiegelt, gleichsam „individuelle Inkarnation der gesellschaftlichen Arbeit“16) ist, oder, anders ausgedrückt: „die Ware, deren Naturalform zugleich unmittelbar gesellschaftliche Verwirklichungsform der menschlichen Arbeit in abstracto ist““). Ob und in welchem Verhältnis alle anderen Arbeitsprodukte faktisch gesellschaftliche Arbeit verkörpern, stellt sich nach dem Gesagten erst im Austausch heraus in dem Augenblick, wo sie die „Wertform“ annehmeu. Erst nach Vollzug des Austausches weiß der Warenbesitzer, ob seine Waren in einer faktischen Tauschrelation überhaupt vorkommen. Dagegen folgt aus der Funktion der Geldware als allgemeinen Äquivalentes, daß ihresgleichen in irgendeiner Form innerhalb der Warenwirtschaft Bestandteil jeder Tauschrelation sein muß. Die als Geld fungierende Ware ist deshalb die einzige, die regelmäßig und sicher der Bestimmung gerecht wird, um derentwillen Waren produziert werden, ihr Besitz allein verbürgt einen jederzeit realisierbaren „Anspruch auf ein entsprechendes Quantum des in der Gesellschaft vorhandenen Warenvorrates“. Zusammenfassend läßt sich etwa sagen, „daß das Geld in der Tat nichts anderes ist als ein besonderer Ausdruck des gesellschaftlichen Charakters der Arbeit und ihrer Produkte, der aber als im Gegensatz zu der Basis der Privatproduktion stets in letzter Instanz als ein Ding, als besondere Ware neben anderen Waren sich darstellen läßt“1’). Ebenso wie die Ware ist das Geld als Ding nicht faßbar, sein Wesen erschließt sich nach M. nur dem, der es als „Produktionsverhältnis“ erkannt hat. Schon seine Eigenschaft als Ware verleiht dem Geld diesen Charakter, und auch seine Sonderstellung gründet sich auf spezielle gesellschaftliche Beziehungen. Der Ausschluß einer Ware als allgemeinen Äquivalentes beruht auf gesellschaftlichem Übereinkommen und wirkt sich aus in der eigentümlichen Stellung des Geldbesitzers allen Warenbesitzern gegenüber: in seinen Händen ist die „allgemeine Ware“, um deren Besitz jeder Eigentümer einer „besonderen“ Ware sich abmüht; ihr Besitz bedeutet direkte Verfügungsmöglichkeit über jede ihrer Wertgröße entsprechende Menge beliebiger Produkte gesellschaftlicher Arbeit. Infolge der Eigentümlichkeit der Warenwirtschaft muß der Warenproduzent überdies an einer bestimmten Stelle des Produktionsprozesses jenen Punkt erreichen, an dem er entsprechend seiner, nach gesellschaftlichen Arbeitsstunden sich bemessenden individuellen Arbeit Verfügung über beliebige Produkte fremder Privatarbeit erhält, wenn der Reproduktionsprozeß ungestört weiter verlaufen soll. Von diesen Verhältnissen weiß der Warenproduzent in der Regel nichts. Er sieht ein Ding, das Geld, mit der besonderen Eigenschaft, daß alle Waren ihre Werte in ihm ausdrücken und gegen das jeder Warenbesitzer das Produkt seiner Arbeit herzugeben bereit ist. Weit entfernt davon, unter diesem Tatbestand gesellschaftliche Verhältnisse zu vermuten, ist er überzeugt, es hier mit Natureigenschaften der Geldware zu tun zu haben; in M.s Sprache heißt das, daß er das Geld zum Fetisch macht. Entsprechend charakterisiert sich der „Fetischismus“ in der Theorie dadurch, daß in der Lehre vom Geld nicht etwa die Untersuchung derjenigen Eigentümlichkeiten des Produktions-prozesses in der Warenwirtschaft das Fundament bildet, als deren äußeres Zeichen die technischen Hindernisse eines regelmäßigen Warenaustausches ohne Geld erscheinen. An Stelle einer solchen Analyse schiebt sich vielmehr eine Beschreibung derjenigen natürlichen Eigenschaften der Geldware, die sie zur Überwindung jener Schwierigkeiten geeignet machen. Der für die Beurteilung der Rolle des Geldes im M.schen System entscheidende Gedankengang ist also dieser: Nur wenn die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit den Warenaustausch regelt, ist eine Gesellschaft von Warenproduzenten lebensfähig. Diese Regelung findet nicht auf rationalem Wege statt. Vielmehr wissen die austauschenden Menschen nichts und können nichts wissen von der Anzahl der auf ihr Produkt entfallenden gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeitsstunden. Es genügt, wenn der Anteil jedes einzelnen an der gesellschaftlichen Gesamtarbeit und sein darauf sich gründender Anspruch auf gesellschaftliche Arbeitsprodukte sich dadurch geltend macht, daß er für das eigene ein äquivalentes Produkt eintauscht. Was jeweils seinem Produkt tatsächlich äquivalent ist, d. h. wieviel gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit dieses enthält, ergibt sich aus der jeweiligen gesellschaftlichen Gesamtsituation, an der nicht nur seine eigene und die einzutauschende Ware, sondern der gesamte Waren- und Kräftevorrat der Gesellschaft mitspricht. Damit dieser Einfluß aller Waren zur Geltung komme, d. h. also damit der Produzent wirklich entsprechend seinem Anteil an der gesellschaftlichen Gesamtarbeit fremde Produkte erhalte, müssen nicht nur zwei, sondern alle Waren kommensurabel sein, eine Notwendigkeit, die sich der Gesellschaft als äußerer technischer Zwang aufdrängen mag. Es bedarf einer Ware, die als allgemeines Äquivalent von den übrigen Waren ausgeschlossen wird, des Geldes. Die Notwendigkeit des Geldes wurzelt also in den tiefsten Struktureigenschaften der warenproduzierenden Gesellschaft. Je weiter sich die Warenproduktion entfaltet, uni so weitläufiger werden die Konsequenzen dieser Notwendigkeit, um so vielfältiger ;die Punktionen, die das Geld zu erfüllen berufen ist. Das Verständnis aller Eigenschaften des Geldes, insbesondere seiner Formbestimmtheiten in der hochentwickelten kapitalistischen Wirtschaft, hängt ab von der Einsicht in die erwähnten grundlegenden Zusammenhänge. III. Den Zugang zum Verständnis der Geldtheorie M.s hat sich nun BLOCK von vorneherein durch völliges Mißverständnis der für M. fundamentalen Unterscheidung zwischen Wesen und Erscheinung verbaut. Seiner Meinung nach handelt es sich lediglich darum, „zwei Betrachtungsweisen zu unterscheiden, denen M. die Gegenstände seiner Forschung unterwirft, die aber in seiner Darstellung regelmäßig ungetrennt durcheinander laufen ...“ (S. 61): eine „sozialphilosophische“ und eine „wirtschaftetheoretische“. Die erstere sehe z. B. im Gelde ein gesellschaftliches Verhältnis, und das sei ein Gedankengang, der mit Wirtschaftstheorie nichts zu tun habe. „Ein philosophischer Inhalt, fährt B. fort, läßt sich nicht in ökonomische Kategorien einordnen ,.. Ich widme also den geldphilosophischen Betrachtungen M.ens einen besonderen Abschnitt18) und beschäftige mich hier nur mit dem öko-nomischen Begriff des Geldes. Unter Geld im ökonomischen Sinn versteht M. eine Ware, die durch ihre natürliche Beschaffenheit befähigt ist, die Funktion eines allgemeinen Äquivalents allen anderen Waren gegenüber zu übernehmen“ (8. 62).”翻译为中文","output":"按照马克思的理论，没有货币的发达商品经济既不能实际存在，也根本无法想象。远非“一个巧妙设想的解决方法”来消除交换交往的某些不便，马克思认为，货币是每一种生产方式的构成要素，其中法律上独立的私人劳动者的生产活动被指派负责“社会生活”的再生产。对商品进行的分析，作为商品生产社会相对于其他社会形式的特征性元素，导致了货币作为商品的必要补充。 货币是一种商品，作为这样的商品是一个“有形-超感官的东西”。有形的是它的自然形态，它作为自然物的存在，因而也包括满足某些需求的适用性——它的使用价值，这与所有货币功能无关。它作为一个社会关系的表达而超感官，是因为它体现了一个特定份额的社会必要总劳动。 货币商品不同于所有其他商品的地方在于，它作为“一般等价物”定期反映了每种商品在社会劳动中的份额，它某种程度上是“社会劳动的个体化化身”，或者换句话说：“自然形态同时直接是人类劳动在抽象中的社会实现形式的商品”。是否以及在何种程度上所有其他劳动产品实际上体现了社会劳动，正如之前所述，只有在交换中，当它们采用“价值形态”时才会显现。只有在完成交换后，商品拥有者才知道他的商品是否根本就出现在一种实际的交换关系中。相反，由于货币商品作为一般等价物的功能，必须以某种形式在商品经济中的每个交换关系中都存在。因此，作为货币的商品是唯一定期且确定地满足商品被生产出来的目的的商品，它的拥有确保了“随时可实现的对社会现有商品库存一定量的索取权”。总之可以说，“货币实际上不过是劳动及其产品社会特性的一个特殊表达，但作为与私人生产基础相对立的最终是以一件物品，作为其他商品旁的特殊商品的形式呈现”。 就像商品一样，货币作为一个物品是无法捉摸的，它的本质只有将其作为“生产关系”来理解的人才能把握。货币的特性作为一种商品本身就赋予了它这一特性，其特殊地位也基于特殊的社会关系。将一种商品排除作为一般等价物是基于社会共识，并体现在货币拥有者与所有商品拥有者的独特地位上：在他手中是“一般商品”，每个“特定”商品的拥有者都在努力获取它；其拥有意味着直接对任何相当于其价值大小的社会劳动产品任意数量的支配权。由于商品经济的特殊性，商品生产者还必须在生产过程的某个点上达到他根据社会劳动小时数所计算的个人劳动，获取任意外部私人劳动产品的能力，以便生产再生产过程能够顺利进行。 商品生产者通常对这些关系一无所知。他看到的是货币，一个具有特殊性质的东西，所有商品都在其中表达它们的价值，每个商品拥有者都愿意交出他们的劳动产品以换取它。远非认为这种情况下存在社会关系，他确信他在处理货币商品的自然属性；用马克思的话说，这意味着他将货币神秘化了。因此，理论中的“拜物教”特征在于，货币的研究不是以对商品经济生产过程中的特点作为其外在标志的技术障碍，即没有货币就无法进行常规商品交换的障碍进行研究作为基础。取而代之的是对那些使货币商品适合克服这些困难的自然属性的描述。 因此，对马克思体系中货币角色进行评价的决定性思考路径是：只有当社会必要劳动时间调节商品交换时，商品生产者社会才能存活。这种调节不是通过理性途径进行的。相反，交换中的人们不知道也无法知道他们的产品上有多少社会必要劳动时间。只需每个人依靠自己的社会总劳动份额和基于此的对社会劳动产品的索求，通过交换自己的产品换取等价的产品来实现。他的产品的实际等价物是什么，即包含多少社会必要劳动时间，取决于当时的社会总状况，不仅涉及他自己的和要交换的商品，还涉及社会的整个商品和力量储备。为了实现所有商品的这种影响，即使制造商确实根据他在社会总劳动中的份额获得外部产品，不仅需要两种，而是所有商品都可以相互衡量的，这是社会可能感受到的外部技术强制。需要一种商品，被作为一般等价物从其他商品中排除，即货币。因此，货币的需求根植于商品生产社会的最深层结构特征。随着商品生产的发展，这种需求的后果变得更为广泛，货币的功能变得更为多样化。理解货币的所有属性，特别是在高度发展的资本主义经济中的形式特征，取决于对这些基本关系的理解。 BLOCK通过完全误解对马克思至关重要的本质与表象之间的区别，从一开始就关闭了理解马克思的货币理论的途径。他认为，这只是要区分马克思对其研究对象施加的“两种观察方式，这两种方式在他的表述中经常不加区分地混在一起......”：“一种社会哲学的和一种经济理论的”。前者例如将货币视为社会关系，而这是一个与经济理论无关的思考过程。\\"一个哲学内容不能划归经济类别......因此我专门为马克思的货币哲学观点安排了一个特别章节，并且在这里只讨论货币的经济概念。在经济意义上，马克思认为货币是一种商品，由于其自然属性，能够承担所有其他商品的一般等价物的功能\\"。"},{"instruction":"请将“B. verwandelt also die M.sche Unterscheidung von Wesen und Erscheinung in zwei grundsätzlich verschiedene Betrachtungsweisen, die bei M. zu Unrecht durcheinanderlaufen und die man deshalb fein säuberlich auseinanderhalten müsse. Dazu ist zu sagen, daß es eine „wirtschaftstheoretische“ Betrachtung im B.schen Sinne bei M. gar nicht gibt, denn sie würde genau auf das hinauslaufen, was M. an den Vulgärökonomen tadelt: auf eine Beschreibung und Systematisierung bloßer Erscheinungsformen ohne den Versuch, zu deren Wesen vorzudringen. Deutlich zeigt das eine Betrachtung der angeblichen „ökonomischen“ Definition des Geldes durch M. als einer Ware von besonders eigentümlicher natürlicher Beschaffenheit. Hiernach wäre M. selbst dem oben charakterisierten „Fetischismus“ zum Opfer gefallen. Betrachten wir diese sonderbare Definition etwas näher und besinnen uns darauf; was Marx unter einer „Ware“ versteht, so stehen wir mitten in der „philosophischen“ Be-trachtungsweise, die doch in einen besonderen Abschnitt verwiesen werden sollte. Denn nach M. besteht das Wesen der Ware eben darin, daß sie nur als „sinnlich-übersinnliches“ Ding zu fassen ist, daß sie — wie alle anderen ökonomischen Kategorien — „nicht eine Sache ist, sondern ein durch Sachen vermitteltes gesellschaftliches Verhältnis zwischen Personen“10). Diesen Grundgedanken des M.schen Systems hat B. offenbar nicht verstanden und deshalb angenommen, es sei möglich, die ökonomischen Kategorien bei M. als wesensgleich mit den gleichlautenden der klassischen Ökonomie anzusehen !0). „Was ist das eigentlich Marxistische an der M.schen Geldtheorie ? “ fragt B. (S. 44), und er antwortet: Nicht die einzelnen Theorien sind es, sondern die Art und Weise, wie M. die verschiedenen Lehrsätze seiner Vorgänger untereinander verschmolzen und in sein System eingefügt hat. - Vergleicht man diese Antwort mit dem, was oben über den Gehalt der M.schen Geldtheorie gesagt wurde, so zeigt sich deutlich, wie wenig ihr Wesen in dem B.schen Buche erfaßt ist. Die großartige Leistung M.s, die Schöpfung einer „gesellschaftlichen Theorie des Geldes“ aus seiner Grundkonzeption der warenproduzierenden Gesellschaft heraus, wird für B. zu einer „eigenartigen“ Verbindung und Eingliederung verschiedenster Elemente, eine Synthese, der B. seine Anerkennung nicht versagen will. Im übrigen glaubt er aber, feststellen zu müssen, daß M. auf keinem Gebiet „derartig unselbständig gearbeitet habe“ wie auf dem der Geldtheorie, und daß es ein leichtes sei, sie „in ein Stück Merkantilismus, ein Stück Produktionskostenlehre, Quantitätstheorie, banking principle und so fort zu zerschlagen ...“ (S. 33). Was B. hindert, trotz offenbar bester Absicht die eigentliche Leistung M.s zu erkennen, ist seine unglückselige Scheidung wirtschaftstheoretischer und philosophischer Elemente in M.s System. Die Theorien, die M. von seinen Vorgängern (bewußt und unter genauester Angabe der Quellen) übernommen hat, betreffen durchweg die Welt der Erscheinung. Deren Beschreibung legte M. seiner Darstellung zugrunde, häufig nicht ohne sie in fruchtbarer Weise verändert oder ergänzt zu haben. So z. B. die Quantitätstheorie, als deren Geltungsbereich er die Zirkulation von Staatspapiergeld mit Zwangskurs nachwies. Aber auf diese Beschreibung von Erscheinungsformen kam es M; gar nicht an. Die Einfügung derartiger Theorien in sein System ist durchaus sekundär gegenüber seinem Versuch, den Geldschleier zu zerreißen und nachzuweisen, daß „das Rätsel des Geldfetisches“ nichts anderes ist als „das sichtbar gewordene, die Augen blendende Rätsel des Warenfetischs“21). Auf die Angriffe, die B. gegen die M.sche dialektische Methode richtet, sei hier nicht näher eingegangen. Sie sind weder neu, noch zeugen sie von besonderer Sachkenntnis, noch sind sie von Belang für die Beurteilung der M.schen Geldtheorie52). Hingegen ist es notwendig, wenigstens zum Teil auf die Kritik einzugehen, die B. an dem im M.schen System fundamentalen und für die Geldtheorie äußerst wichtigen Begriff der „gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit“ übt. Ihr Inhalt ist ungefähr folgender: 1. Gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeit bedeutet bei M. ursprünglich technisch durchschnittliche Arbeit. Da diese Fassung in der Durchführung auf Schwierigkeiten stößt, gab M. dem Begriff „eine neue Wendung“: notwendig für den Bedarf der Gesellschaft (S. 49)23). 2. Gesellschaftlicher Bedarf läßt sich nicht in Arbeitsstunden ausdrücken, denn „das Bedürfnis ist keine objektiv feststehende Größe, sondern wird durch die Geldmittel bestimmt, über welche die Nachfrage verfügt, und durch die Preise, die sie auf dem Markt vorfindet“ (S. 113, 51)S1). 3. Die „neue Wendung“ führt geldtheoretisch zur Quantitätstheorie (S. 51, 55, 96, 112); ferner 4. zur Bestimmung des Wertes durch die Konkurrenz, welche aber nur Abweichungen vom Wert erklären kann. „Würde also der Wert durch die Konkurrenz konstituiert, so würde eine Kraft, die nur Abweichungen von der Norm bewirken kann, die Norm selbst inhaltlich bestimmen“ (S. 53)sa); 5. zur Hineintragung subjektivistischer Elemente in die objektivistische Wertlehre (S. 54, 58, 94)!8); 6. zur Theorie von der Bildung des Wertes durch die dispositive und spekulative Tätigkeit des Unternehmers (S. 54)2T); und schließlich 7. zu einem circulus vitiosus, da M. die Verteilung aus der Produktion ableitet, während hier umgekehrt die Produktion auf die Nachfrage zurückgeführt werde (8. 54)8B). 8. Mit der M.schen Geldtheorie stimmt so die erste Fassung der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit als technologischer Durchschnitt überein und auch diese nur unter der absurden Voraussetzung, daß sich alle Waren zu ihrem Wert absetzen lassen (S. 55). 9. Die Auslegung der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit im technologischen Sinn führt in Verbindung mit der Geldtheorie notwendig zu einer Theorie der krisenlosen Wirtschaft (8. 81, 103). Aus den hier von B. aufgerollten Problemen gehen wir nur auf diejenigen ein, die unmittelbare geldtheoretische Konsequenzen haben, und begnügen uns bei den übrigen Punkten jeweils mit den kurzen Anmerkungen. Wir beginnen mit B.s häufig wiederholter Behauptung, daß die „nene Wendung“ geldtheoretisch zur Quantitätstheorie führen müsse. JAMES STEÜART, SO sagt M., war „der erste, der die Frage stellt: ist die Quantität des umlaufenden Geldes durch die Warenpreise, oder sind die Warenpreise durch die Quantität des umlaufenden Geldes bestimmt“1’)? Die Lehrmeinungen, welche die Geldquantität als bestimmendes Moment der Warenpreise betrachten, werden unter dem Begriffe „Quantitätstheorie“ zusammengefaßt. M. lehnt die Quantitätstheorie ab und akzeptiert die Gegenthese. Der Zirkulationsprozeß, welcher nach der stofflichen Seite hin die Reproduktion des gesellschaftlichen Lebens vermittelt, zeigt, isoliert betrachtet, nichts als den eintönigen Prozeß W-G-W, nichts als Formveränderungen der Warenwerte.

Gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeit bedeutet bei M. ursprünglich technisch durchschnittliche Arbeit. Da diese Fassung in der Durchführung auf Schwierigkeiten stößt, gab M. dem Begriff „eine neue Wendung“: notwendig für den Bedarf der Gesellschaft (S. 49)23). 2. Gesellschaftlicher Bedarf läßt sich nicht in Arbeitsstunden ausdrücken, denn „das Bedürfnis ist keine objektiv feststehende Größe, sondern wird durch die Geldmittel bestimmt, über welche die Nachfrage verfügt, und durch die Preise, die sie auf dem Markt vorfindet“ (S. 113, 51)S1). 3. Die „neue Wendung“ führt geldtheoretisch zur Quantitätstheorie (S. 51, 55, 96, 112); ferner 4. zur Bestimmung des Wertes durch die Konkurrenz, welche aber nur Abweichungen vom Wert erklären kann. „Würde also der Wert durch die Konkurrenz konstituiert, so würde eine Kraft, die nur Abweichungen von der Norm bewirken kann, die Norm selbst inhaltlich bestimmen“ (S. 53)sa); 5. zur Hineintragung subjektivistischer Elemente in die objektivistische Wertlehre (S. 54, 58, 94)!8); 6. zur Theorie von der Bildung des Wertes durch die dispositive und spekulative Tätigkeit des Unternehmers (S. 54)2T); und schließlich 7. zu einem circulus vitiosus, da M. die Verteilung aus der Produktion ableitet, während hier umgekehrt die Produktion auf die Nachfrage zurückgeführt werde (8. 54)8B). 8. Mit der M.schen Geldtheorie stimmt so die erste Fassung der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit als technologischer Durchschnitt überein und auch diese nur unter der absurden Voraussetzung, daß sich alle Waren zu ihrem Wert absetzen lassen (S. 55). 9. Die Auslegung der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit im technologischen Sinn führt in Verbindung mit der Geldtheorie notwendig zu einer Theorie der krisenlosen Wirtschaft (8. 81, 103). Aus den hier von B. aufgerollten Problemen gehen wir nur auf diejenigen ein, die unmittelbare geldtheoretische Konsequenzen haben, und begnügen uns bei den übrigen Punkten jeweils mit den kurzen Anmerkungen. Wir beginnen mit B.s häufig wiederholter Behauptung, daß die „nene Wendung“ geldtheoretisch zur Quantitätstheorie führen müsse. JAMES STEÜART, SO sagt M., war „der erste, der die Frage stellt: ist die Quantität des umlaufenden Geldes durch die Warenpreise, oder sind die Warenpreise durch die Quantität des umlaufenden Geldes bestimmt“1’)? Die Lehrmeinungen, welche die Geldquantität als bestimmendes Moment der Warenpreise betrachten, werden unter dem Begriffe „Quantitätstheorie“ zusammengefaßt. M. lehnt die Quantitätstheorie ab und akzeptiert die Gegenthese. Der Zirkulationsprozeß, welcher nach der stofflichen Seite hin die Reproduktion des gesellschaftlichen Lebens vermittelt, zeigt, isoliert betrachtet, nichts als den eintönigen Prozeß W-G-W, nichts als Formveränderungen der Warenwerte. Die Aufgabe des als Zirkulationsmittel fungierenden Geldes erschöpft sich darin, den Warenwerten die Geldfonn zu geben. Es stellt „nur reell die in der Preissumme der Waren bereits ideell ausgedrückte Goldsumme dar“80). Daraus folgt, daß in einem gegebenen Zeitabschnitt die Masse des als Zirkulationsmittel fungierenden Geldes bestimmt ist durch die zu realisierende Preissumme der Waren81). .”翻译为中文","output":"1. 在马克思看来，社会必要劳动最初意味着技术上的平均劳动。由于这个定义在实施中遇到困难，马克思给这个概念“赋予了新的含义”：为社会需求所必需（第49页）。 2. 社会需求不能用劳动小时来表示，因为“需求不是一个客观固定的量，而是由市场上的货币资金和价格确定的需导所具备的资金和市场遇到的价格决定”（第113页，51）。 3. “新转向”在货币理论上导向数量理论（第51页，第55页，第96页，第112页）；进一步 4. 通过竞争来确定价值，但这只能解释价值的偏差。“因此，如果价值是由竞争构成的，那么只能引起偏差的力量本身就在内容上决定了规范”（第53页）； 5. 在客观价值理论中引入主观因素（第54页，第58页，第94页）； 6. 通过企业家的决策和投机活动形成价值的理论（第54页）；最后 7. 形成一个循环论证，因为马克思从生产中推导分配，而这里反过来将生产归因于需求（第54页）。 8. 因此，与马克思的货币理论相一致的是社会必要劳动的第一种定义作为技术平均，且这仅在所有商品都能按其价值销售的荒谬假设下成立（第55页）。 9. 将社会必要劳动以技术意义解释与货币理论结合，必然导致无危机的经济理论（第81页，第103页）。 在B.提出的问题中，我们仅讨论那些具有直接货币理论后果的问题，并对其他问题只做简单注释。 我们从B.经常重复的说法开始，即“新转向”必然导向数量理论。 马克思说，詹姆斯·斯图尔特是“第一个提出这个问题的人：是商品价格决定了流通中的货币数量，还是流通中的货币数量决定了商品价格”？认为货币数量是商品价格的决定因素的观点被归纳为“数量理论”。马克思反对数量理论，接受了对立论点。从物质角度看，贸易流通过程仅仅表现为W-G-W这一单调过程，仅仅是商品价值的形态变化。作为流通媒介的货币的任务仅仅在于为商品价值赋予货币形式。它“真实地代表了商品价格总和中已经理念上表达的黄金总量”。因此，结论是，在给定的时间段内，作为流通媒介的货币总量由需要实现的商品价格总和决定。"},{"instruction":"请将“Dieses Gesetz, das sich notwendig aus dem M.schen Zirkulationsbegriff ergibt, erfährt im Laufe seiner Untersuchung verschiedene Ergänzungen. Es wird modifiziert durch die Umlaufsgeschwindigkeit des Geldes’2), durch die Funktion des Geldes als Zahlungsmittel83), sowie durch die Komplikationen, denen es „in der kapitalistischen Zirkulation mit ihren komplizierten Verkehrsvorgängen und ihren Geldsurrogaten verschiedenster Art unterworfen ist“8*). Die Grundstruktur des Gesetzes wird jedoch durch keine dieser Modifikationen geändert, sie läßt sich immer durch die Formel ausdrücken: Preissumme der Waren = Summe des zirkulierenden Geldes. Auf den ersten Blick scheint sich das M.sche Gesetz von der Quantitätstheorie nur dadurch zu unterscheiden, daß bei M. die linke Seite der Formel die rechte Seite bestimmt, während bei der Quantitätstheorie die linke als abhängige Variable gilt. Jedoch ist der Unterschied viel tiefer: die Quantitätstheorie betrachtet jeweils die gesamte in dem betreffenden Lande vorhandene Geldmenge und setzt sie gleich mit „zahlungsfähiger Nachfrage“. Von dieser Gleichsetzung ist aber bei M. keine Rede, für ihn handelt es sich vielmehr um ein Gesetz, welches die Quantität des zirkulierenden Geldes betrifft. Er will damit nachweisen, daß in der Zirkulationssphäre nie mehr Geld vorhanden sein kann, als dort gebraucht wird; ein etwaiger Überschuß wird beseitigt entweder durch Verlangsamung der Umlaufsgeschwindigkeit oder durch Abfliessen in die hoards. Eine Einwirkung der Geldmenge auf das Preisniveau, wie es von der Quantitätstheorie behauptet wird, ist demnach für M. bei Geld im eigentlichen Sinne ausgeschlossen. Papiergeld, d. h. Staatspapiergeld mit Zwangskurs, unterscheidet sich vom „Geld“ gerade dadurch, daß es die Zirkulationssphäre nicht verlassen kann und deshalb preissteigernd wirkt, sobald es in einem größeren Nominalbetrag ausgegeben wird, als die für die Zirkulation erforderliche (Gold-) Geldmenge. B. begeht nun den elementaren Fehler, voräuszusetzen, bei M. sei zirkulierende Geldmenge identisch mit der für den Einkauf der Waren verfügbaren Geldsumme, d. h. mit der gesamten zahlungsfähigen Nachfrage. Diese beiden Größen haben aber bei M. unmittelbar gar nichts miteinander zu tun. Zahlungsfähige Nachfrage kommt zustande durch die Verausgabung gesellschaftlich notwendiger Arbeit, das Geld spielt dabei keine konstitutive, sondern lediglich eine deklaratorische Rolle. Wenn B. an anderer Stelle (S. 103) sagt, der M.schen Auffassung liege „im Grunde die Anschauung zugrunde, daß sich Waren gegen Waren tauschen“, so hat er damit völlig recht”). Nur dadurch, daß er diese Grundanschauung wieder vergessen hat, kann B. zur Behauptung kommen: bei einer Interpretierung der Werttheorie im Sinne des gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses wäre „die auf dem Markt vorhandene (soll heißen die zirkulierende) Geldmenge“ nicht „von der ihr gegenüberstehenden Preissumme“ (soll heißen Summe der zu realisierenden Warenpreise) abhängig, sondern der Geldbetrag, über den die Nachfrage verfüge, also eine gegebene Geldsumme, verteile sich auf die Waren, deren Preis ein aliquoter Teil der Geldmenge sei. Der Nachweis dafür, daß die M.sche Wertlehre in der „zweiten Fassung“ „bei folgerichtiger Anwendung auf die Geldlehre die Quantitätstheorie in sich schließt“, ist B. mißlungen. Nicht viel besser steht es mit der These B.s unter 5: nur unter der utopischen Voraussetzung, daß sich alle Waren zu ihrem Wert (im Sinne des technologischen Durchschnitts) absetzen lassen, stimmen Geld- und Werttheorie hei M. zusammen. Denn sonst — so meint er — würden sich „ungleiche Wertquanten austauschen, z. B. würden zehn Werteinheiten in Warenform gegen neun Werteinheiten in Geld ausgetauscht werden und der Best ließe sich nicht realisieren“ (S. 51). Nun sagt aber B. ausdrücklich, daß sich dieser Teil seiner Untersuchungen nur auf die „einfache Warenproduktion“ beziehe (S. 65), in der sich also nach M. die Werte noch nicht in „Produktionspreise“ verwandeln, sondern der Austausch aller Waren zu ihren Werten erfolgt. Das ist aber durchaus nicht identisch damit, daß nun auch alle Waren, die auf dem Markt erscheinen, tatsächlich abgesetzt werden. Erst nach dem Verkauf weiß der Warenbesitzer, ob und wieviel Wert seine Ware verkörperte. Allerdings gilt für die „einfache Warenproduktion“ bei M. das Gesetz, daß die Waren entweder zu ihren Werten oder überhaupt nicht Absatz finden. Man mag die Richtigkeit dieses Gesetzes bestreiten, was ja wahrlich oft genug geschehen ist, unterstellt man es aber als richtig, dann fällt der B.sche Einwand in sich zusammen. Eine ganz andere Frage ist es, inwieweit die Verwandlung der Werte in „Produktionspreise“ die Wertmaßfunktion des Geldes berührt, eine Frage, die sehr genauer Prüfung bedarf und auf die M. keine ausdrückliche Antwort gibt. Der Lösungsversuch B.s, an Stelle der wertbildenden Arbeit eine „produktionspreisbildende Arbeit“ als Wertsubstanz anzunehmen (S. 99), erscheint unvereinbar mit der Grundstruktur des M.schen Systems. Der letzte Versuch B.s, im Zusammenhang mit dem Begriff der gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit die M.sche Geldtheorie ad absurdum zu führen, schließt sich an die Behauptung an, daß „jede Ware, soweit sie gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeitszeit enthält, notwendig Absatz finden muß“ (8. 81). Hiergegen läßt sich nichts sagen, sofern man die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeit nicht fehlerhaft im technologischen Sinn auffaßt. B. fährt aber fort: „Ja, sofern die gesellschaftlich notwendige Arbeit im technologischen Sinn ausgelegt wird, muß sich der Ablauf der Wirtschaft viel ruhevoller und harmonischer vollziehen, als es sich SAY oder EICABDO je hätten träumen lassen ... Sie leugneten nicht jede Depression; denn gerade durch die Preis-senkung sollte die Produktion auf den rechten Weg gewiesen und eine Krise vermieden werden. Auf Grund der M.schen Geldtheorie ist dagegen die kon-junkturlose Wirtschaft, die eine Seihe von Quantitätstheoretikern durch eine geschickte Geldpolitik verwirklicht sehen möchte, aus einer Forderung an die Wirtschaft ... zur Wirklichkeit gestempelt worden, zu einer Realität, die den Kassandrarufen der JLschen Krisentheorie die Rechtfertigung entzieht“ (8. 81). Folgerichtig müsse also, so sagt B. an anderer Stelle (8. 103), „die M.sche Auffassung zur Leugnung der Krisen führen“.”翻译为中文","output":"这一定律，因其必然源于马克思对流通概念的阐释，在其研究过程中经历了各种补充。它被货币的流通速度、货币作为支付手段的功能、以及它“在资本主义流通中与其复杂的交通事务和各种货币替代品所承受的复杂情况”所修正。然而，这些修改并未改变该定律的基本结构，它总是可以用以下公式来表达：商品价格之和 = 流通中的货币总量。 乍一看，马克思的定律与数量理论的区别仅在于，在马克思这里，公式的左侧决定了右侧，而在数量理论中，左侧被视为依赖变量。然而，差异要深得多：数量理论考虑的是特定国家中存在的全部货币量，并将其等同于“支付能力的需求”。但在马克思这里，完全没有这种等同，对他而言，这更是一个涉及流通中货币量的定律。他意在证明，流通领域中永远不会存在比所需更多的货币；任何过剩都会通过减缓流通速度或流向储备而被消除。因此，马克思认为，货币量影响价格水平，如数量理论所断言的，在实际货币中是被排除的。纸币，即具有强制流通的国家纸币，与“货币”恰恰因为它不能离开流通领域而有所不同，并因此一旦以超过流通所需的（黄金）货币量的面额发行，就会产生价格上涨的影响。B.犯了一个基本错误，假定在马克思那里，流通中的货币量等同于购买商品的可用货币总量，即整体支付能力的需求。但在马克思这里，这两个量根本就没有直接关联。支付能力的需求是通过社会必要工作的支出产生的，货币在此中没有构成作用，而只是扮演一种宣告性角色。如果B.在其他地方（第103页）说，马克思的观点“基本上是商品与商品的交换”，那他完全正确。只有因为他又忘记了这一基本观点，B.才能得出结论：如果按照社会需求对价值理论的解释，“市场上存在的（也就是流通中的）货币量”不会依赖于它所对应的商品价格之和（应指需要实现的商品价格之和），而是需求所能分配的货币量，因此是一个给定的货币总量，它分配在商品上，其价格是货币量的等比部分。 B.未能证明，马克思的价值理论在其“第二种形态”下，“如被逻辑应用于货币理论，则包含数量理论”这一说法。 B.的第五个观点也同样站不住脚：仅在所有商品都能按各自的价值（以技术平均来衡量）销售的乌托邦假设下，马克思的货币与价值理论才一致。否则——据他称——“不平等的价值量会交换，例如，以商品形式的十个价值单位会与以货币形式的九个价值单位交换，余额将无法实现”（第51页）。现在，B.明确表示，他的研究只涉及“简单商品生产”（第65页），在这一阶段，按照马克思，商品还没有转化为“生产价格”，而是所有商品按它们的价值进行交换。这并不意味着所有出现在市场上的商品都实际上能被销售。只有在销售后，商品拥有者才知道他的商品体现了多少价值。确实，在马克思所说的“简单商品生产”中，法则是商品要么按其价值销售，要么根本不被销售。人们可以质疑这一定律的正确性，这确实已经被频繁质疑过了，但如果假定它是正确的，那么B.的反驳便自相矛盾了。将价值转化为“生产价格”如何影响货币的价值测量功能是另一个问题，需要非常仔细的审查，马克思没有明确回答。B.试图代之以“生产价格形成的劳动”作为价值本质的解决方案（第99页），似乎与马克思体系的基本结构不兼容。 B.最后试图联系社会必要劳动的概念，将马克思的货币理论推向荒谬，是基于这样的声明，“每件商品，只要它包含社会必要劳动时间，就必然能找到销路”（第81页）。对此没有异议，只要不是错误地以技术意义理解社会必要劳动。但B.接着说：“是的，如果社会必要劳动以技术意义来解释，经济活动的进行将比萨伊或里卡多所能梦想的更为平静和和谐......他们并不否认任何经济萧条；因为正是通过价格下降，生产应当被引导回正确道路，从而避免危机。而根据马克思的货币理论，那些通过巧妙的货币政策希望实现无周期波动经济的数量理论家们所想的，已经从对经济的一种要求......变成了现实，变成了否定马克思危机理论的卡桑德拉呼声的真实性”（第81页）。因此，按B.在其他地方（第103页）所言，“马克思的观点应当导致否认经济危机”的逻辑必然性。"},{"instruction":"请将“In diesem Gedankengang steckt ein ganzes Knäuel von Mißverständnissen, •dessen restlose Entwirrung hier viel zu weit führen würde. Im wesentlichen beruht B.s Beweisführung auf vier falschen Annahmen, die wir zum Teil schon kennen: daß „das für die Zirkulation erheischte Quantum Gold“ gleich sei mit der zahlungsfähigen Nachfrage; daß alle angebotenen Güter deshalb Absatz finden müßten; daß gesellschaftlich notwendige gleich technologisch •durchschnittliche Arbeit sei; daß schließlich M. die aus methodologischen Gründen im I. Band des „Kapital“ vorgenommene Annahme, daß Angebot und Nachfrage sich decken, verabsolutiert habe. Die Sinnlosigkeit der letzten Annahme läßt sich leicht an den folgenden Sätzen zeigen, die gleichzeitig eine treffende Zusammenfassung der M.schen Meinung über einige hier behandelte Probleme geben: „Damit eine Ware zu ihrem Marktwert verkauft wird, d. h. im Verhältnis zu der in ihr enthaltenen gesellschaftlich notwendigen Arbeit, muß das Gesamtquantum gesellschaftlicher Arbeit, welches auf die •Gesamtmasse dieser Warenart verwandt wird, dem Quantum des gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses für sie entsprechen, d. h. des zahlungsfähigen gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnisses. Die Konkurrenz, die Schwankungen der Marktpreise, die ■den Schwankungen des Verhältnisses von Nachfrage und Zufuhr entsprechen, suchen beständig das Gesamtquantum der auf jede Warenart verwandten Arbeit auf dieses Maß zu reduzieren“86). Die vorstehenden Ausführungen dürften erwiesen haben, daß die B.sche Darstellung und Kritik der M.schen Geldtheorie in keiner Weise gerecht geworden ist. Es erübrigt sich deshalb wohl, auf die vielen anderen Punkte einzugehen, durch deren Erörterung unsere These weiter erhärtet werden könnte. Hingegen soll nochmals betont werden, daß sich in der B.schen Arbeit auch eine Anzahl interessanter Einzelheiten findet, wohl geeignet, zum Nachdenken über die geldtheoretischen Probleme bei M. anzuregen. Wir verweisen auf B.s Ausführungen über das Problem des Goldwertes (S. 65 ff.); »über die Schwierigkeiten, die sich durch die Lehre von den Produktionspreisen für die Geldtheorie ergeben (S. 93ff.); über die Problematik der Horttheorie (8. 103 ff.) u. a. So läßt sich abschließend sagen, daß B.s Buch in gewissem Sinne auch einen Beitrag zu den Vorarbeiten der eingangs geforderten systematischen und kritischen Nachschöpfung der M.schen Geldtheorie bildet. ”翻译为中文","output":"在这一思路中，存在着一系列的误解，其彻底澄清在此将会过于冗长。本质上，B.的论证基于我们部分已知的四个错误假设：即“流通中所需的黄金量”等同于支付能力的需求；因此所有提供的商品都必须找到销路；社会必要劳动等同于技术上的平均劳动；最后，马克思在《资本论》第一卷中出于方法论原因所作的假设即供需相等，被他绝对化。最后一个假设的荒谬性可以通过以下几句话轻易展现，这些话同时也是对马克思关于此处讨论的一些问题观点的精辟总结：“为了商品能以其市场价值售出，即按照其中所含社会必要劳动的比例，社会对这类商品种类的总量所投入的社会总劳动量，必须与社会需求量相对应，即与有支付能力的社会需求量相对应。竞争、市场价格的波动，这些波动对应需求与供应的关系的变化，不断地尝试将每类商品上所投入的劳动总量减少到这一度量。” 以上论述应该已经证明，B.对马克思货币理论的描述和批评在任何方面都不公正。因此，讨论许多其他点，通过它们我们的论点可以得到进一步证实，似乎已无必要。然而，应再次强调，B.的作品中也存在许多有趣的细节，这些细节非常适合触发对马克思货币理论问题的思考。我们引用B.关于黄金价值问题（第65页及以下）的论述；关于生产价格理论给货币理论带来的困难（第93页及以下）；关于囤积理论的问题（第103页及以下）等。因此，可以最终说，B.的书在某种程度上也为前述要求的系统化和批判性重构马克思货币理论的前期工作做出了贡献。"},{"instruction":"Is \\"Decrement the internal counter by 4\\" reflected in the code under \\"WREQ\\"? <<<StartOfFile:DMAC/RTL/DMAC_CFG.sv>>> module DMAC_CFG ( input wire clk, input wire rst_n, // _n means active low // AMBA APB interface input wire psel_i, input wire penable_i, input wire [11:0] paddr_i, input wire pwrite_i, input wire [31:0] pwdata_i, output reg pready_o, output reg [31:0] prdata_o, output reg pslverr_o, // configuration registers output reg [31:0] src_addr_o, output reg [31:0] dst_addr_o, output reg [15:0] byte_len_o, output wire start_o, input wire done_i );

The main purpose of this DMAC design is to integrate into SoC for exchange a large volume of data between memory and peripherals at high speed. The proposed DMAC works on ARM’s Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) specification. The DMAC provides an AMBA APB interface to configure the IP, and an AMBA AXI interface to transfer data. 2 Architecture Specification 2.1 General Description Some applications require transferring a volume of data between memory and peripherals without any modification on data. In software, it is commonly served by executing the memcpy library function in C, C++ or other languages. In C, the function has the following interface and copies len bytes from the object pointed by src to the object pointed by dst: void* memcpy(void* dst, const void* src, size_t len). While a pure software-based implementation of memcpy transfers data using CPU instructions, DMA does not use expensive CPU cycles but uses a hardware engine (DMAC) for the transfer. This can significantly speed up data transfers and allows using CPU for other jobs. 2.2 Usage Constraints Below describe constraints in utilizing DMAC v1. -The src and dst addresses are physical addresses. -The src and dst addresses must be a multiple of 4. -The len must be a multiple of 4. -The maximum len is 0xFFFF -Source and destination ranges must not overlap. 2.3 Programming Model Software can use the following sequence to transfer data using DMAC. -1.Write the source address to DMA_SRC register -2.Write the destination address to DMA_DST register -3.Write length to DMA_LEN register -4.Write 1 to bit[0] of DMA_CMD register -5.Wait until DMA_STATUS register has bit[0] as 1. 2.4 Register Map In order to control DMAC, software can configure the following registers. +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | Offset | Reg Name | 31 | 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 | 24 | 23 | 22 | 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x00 | DMA_VER | version | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x04~0xFC | Reserved | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x100 | DMA_SRC | start_addr | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x104 | DMA_DST | start_addr | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x108 | DMA_LEN | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | byte_len | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x10C | DMA_CMD | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | start | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x110 | DMA_STATUS | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | done | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ 2.4.1 DMA VERSION | Field name | Bit range | R/W | Reset value | Desciption | |------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | version | [31:0] | R | 0x0001_2024 | The version of this DMA controller.

It reads data from memory, buffers the data, and write the data into memory. It repeats this procedure until it completes transferring the specified number of bytes. For simplicity, it read/writes one-cycle data (4 bytes) at a time (in other words, burst-1 transfers). For simplicity, this microarchitecture does not consider write responses from the AXI interface. Later versions will support burst transfers and write responses. 3.1 External Interface DMAC v1.1 has the following external interfaces to communicate with other hardware IPs. -AMBA APB interface for configuration -AMBA AXI interface for data transfer The image you’ve uploaded is a diagram showing the on-chip interconnect of a computer system. Here’s a detailed description: The diagram illustrates how the CPU core, memory, and DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) are connected through an on-chip interconnect. The connections also include specific interfaces like Config interface (APB) and Data interface (AXI). “CPU core” is a box on the left side connected to the central “On-chip interconnect” cloud shape with a bidirectional arrow. Below the “CPU core,” there’s another box labeled “Memory,” also connected to the “On-chip interconnect” with a bidirectional arrow. On the right side, there’s a box labeled “DMAC” connected to both “Config interface (APB)” and “Data interface (AXI)” which are in turn connected to the central “On-chip interconnect” with bidirectional arrows. The arrows indicate that data can flow in both directions between these components. 3.2 Block Diagram DMAC v1.1 has the following blocks inside. The diagram is divided into three main blocks labeled “DMAC_TOP,” “DMAC_CFG,” and “DMAC_ENGINE.” “clk” and “rst” are inputs to the “DMAC_TOP” block. An arrow labeled “APB” connects the “DMAC_TOP” block to the “DMAC_CFG” block. Another arrow labeled “AXI” connects both the “DMAC_TOP” and “DMAC_CFG” blocks to the “DMAC_ENGINE” block. Inside the “DMAC_ENGINE” block, there are four internal components labeled as follows: SRC_ADDR DST_ADDR CNT DATA BUF There’s also a small circular graph with nodes labeled 0 to 3 inside this block. This diagram is likely used to illustrate the flow of data or control signals between these components in a Direct Memory Access Controller configuration. Please let me know if you need more information! 3.3 Configuration Register (lab2) This block receives read/write requests from the APB and configures the registers describes in Section 2.4. 3.4 Finite State Machine (lab3) DMA engine utilizes the following state machine to control operations. The diagram contains five blue circles representing different states: IDLE, RREQ, RDATA, WREQ, and WDATA. Arrows connect these circles indicating the flow from one state to another. Each arrow has text annotations that describe the conditions for transitioning from one state to another. For example, transitioning from IDLE to RREQ requires writing 1 to DMA_CMD & LEN!=0, and copying DMA_SRC/DST/LEN. There are also annotations on the state circles themselves, such as “done=1” on IDLE and “AWVALID=1” on WDATA. +-------+--------------------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | State | Major outputs | Next State | Next state transition condition | Notes | | +---------+--------+---------+--------+------+ | | | | | ARVALID | RREADY | AWVALID | WVALID | done | | | | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | IDLE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | RREQ | (DMA_CMD.start is written as 1) and (DMA_LEN.byte_len!=0) | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_SRC to SRC_ADDR. | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_DST to DST_ADDR | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_LEN to the internal counter | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | RREQ | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | RDATA | ARREADY=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Increment ARADDR by 4 | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | RDATA | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | WREQ | RVALID=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Buffer RDATA into the data buffer | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | WREQ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | WDATA | AWREADY=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Increment AWADDR by 4 | | | | | | | | | | - Decrement the internal counter by 4 | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | WDATA | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | RREQ | (WREADY=1) & (counter!=0) | | | | | | | | +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | | | | | | | IDLE | (WREADY=1) & (counter==0) | | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ The diagram contains horizontal lines representing different signals or data paths labeled as “clk”, “state”, “write to CMD”, “AR*”, “R*”, “AW*” and “W*”. Each line has different states represented by segments of varying lengths; these include labels like “IDLE”, “RREQ”, “RDATA”, “WREQ”, “WDATA”. Vertical dashed lines indicate transitions between these states. There are three rectangular boxes labeled as ‘SRC’, ‘DST’, and ‘DATA’ connected to the waveform lines indicating sources, destinations, or data types associated with those specific points in time. Numbers from 0 to 16 are marked at the bottom of the image indicating time intervals or clock cycles. { \\"signal\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"clk\\", \\"wave\\": \\"p....|..........\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"state\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2.3.4|..5.6.2...\\", \\"data\\": [\\"IDLE\\", \\"RREQ\\", \\"RDATA\\", \\"WREQ\\", \\"WDATA\\", \\"IDLE\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"write to CMD\\", \\"wave\\": \\"010..|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"1\\"] }, {}, [ \\"AR ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"ARVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0.1.0|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"SRC\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARADDR(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x.3.x|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"SRC\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARLEN(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2....|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"0\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0..10|..........\\" }, ], [ \\"R ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"RREADY(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0...1|..0.......\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"RVALID(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|.10.......\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"RDATA(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|.4x.......\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DATA\\"] }, ], [ \\"AW ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"AWVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|..1.0.....\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWADDR(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|..5.x.....\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DST\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWLEN(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2....|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"0\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|...10.....\\" }, ], [ \\"W ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"WVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|....1.0...\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"WDATA(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|....4.x...\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DATA\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"WREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|.....10...\\" } ] ], \\"head\\" : { \\"tick\\" : \\"0\\" }, \\"foot\\" : { \\"tick\\" : \\"0\\" } } 그림 1. DMA operation with microarchitecture v1.1 4 Micro-architecture v1.2 Specification (lab4) A problem with microarchitecture v1.1 is that it reads/writes data one-by-one. As memory read takes some time, DMAC v1.1 will suffer from poor performance with a long memory read latency (그림 2).

DMA operation with microarchitecture 1.1. At a time, it transfers single burst of data In Microarchitecture version 2, DMAC transfers up to 16 cycles of data with a single access. This can significantly reduce execution time by transferring data in bursts (그림 3).","output":"The provided files and description outline the design and implementation of a Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller with Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) interfaces. The DMA controller facilitates fast data transfers between memory and peripherals, minimizing CPU involvement to boost overall system performance. The system is programmed via registers manipulated through the AMBA Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) for configuration, while data transfers utilize the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI). # Highlights: - The DMA controller supports burst data transfers to mitigate performance degradation due to memory read latency, enhancing data throughput between source and destination. - The controller's functionality is encapsulated in several SystemVerilog modules that model different aspects of the DMA's operation, including configuration (\`DMAC_CFG\`), actual data transfer logic (\`DMAC_ENGINE\`), and top-level integration (\`DMAC_TOP\`). - The state machine within \`DMAC_ENGINE\` manages the data transfer process, employing states like \`IDLE\`, \`RREQ\` (Read Request), \`RDATA\` (Read Data), \`WREQ\` (Write Request), and \`WDATA\` (Write Data) to control reads and writes. - The design introduces a versioning scheme for upgrades and compatibility tracking, demonstrated by a \`DMA_VER\` register indicating the DMA controller's version. # Design Review and Improvements: 1. **Microarchitecture Optimization:** - The introduction of burst data transfers in v1.2 illustrates a significant improvement over single-cycle data transfers in v1.1. Efficient handling of memory read/write latencies via burst transfers is crucial in DMA engines, especially for high-bandwidth data movement tasks. - Future enhancements could include dynamic burst size adjustments based on system load or memory controller feedback to optimize throughput further. 2. **Error Handling:** - The documentation and code snippets focus primarily on the data path and configuration. Robust error handling mechanisms (e.g., handling of read/write errors, address misalignment, or invalid configuration) should be integrated to ensure system reliability and fault tolerance. 3. **Power Management:** - Consider implementing power management features that allow the DMA controller to enter low-power states when idle or when transfers are complete, contributing to overall energy efficiency in the SoC. 4. **Security Considerations:** - For systems with security requirements, adding features to ensure secure DMA (sDMA) operations, such as address range checks, access control lists (ACLs), or encryption/decryption capabilities, might be necessary. 5. **Software Interface and Tooling:** - A well-documented software interface, including driver support and API documentation, would facilitate the adoption and integration of the DMA controller within larger systems. - Development of simulation environments or test benches demonstrating the DMA controller's integration with other SoC components can be valuable for validation and performance benchmarking. In conclusion, the proposed DMA controller design represents a solid foundation for efficient data transfers within SoC architectures. Continued evolution of the design should focus on enhancing performance, reliability, security, and ease of integration to address diverse application requirements."},{"instruction":"Is \\"Decrement the internal counter by 4\\" reflected in the code under \\"WREQ\\"?","output":"Yes, the action of decrementing the internal counter by 4 is reflected under the \\"WREQ\\" state in the provided \`DMAC_ENGINE\` module code. Specifically, it occurs within the \`always_comb\` block that defines the state transition behavior of the DMA controller. Here is the relevant portion extracted and simplified for clarity: \`\`\`systemverilog always_comb begin ... case (state) ... S_WREQ: begin awvalid = 1'b1; if (awready_i) begin dst_addr_n = dst_addr + 4; // Prepare for the next address state_n = S_WDATA; end end S_WDATA: begin wvalid = 1'b1; if (wready_i) begin if (cnt != 1) begin cnt_n = cnt - 1'b1; // Decrement the count state_n = S_RREQ; // Prepare for the next cycle of read and write end else begin state_n = S_IDLE; // Transfer is complete, return to IDLE end end end ... endcase end \`\`\` From the code snippet, we can observe the following: - During the \`S_WREQ\` (Write Request) state, when the write address (\`awready_i\`) is ready, the DMA engine prepares for data writing by incrementing the destination address (\`dst_addr + 4\`). This part sets up the address for the next data packet to write. - In the \`S_WDATA\` (Write Data) state, upon the write transaction being ready (\`wready_i\`), the internal counter (\`cnt\`) is decremented by 1 (which represents the operation of moving 4 bytes since the counter is essentially counting the number of 4-byte words left to transfer). This decrement reflects the completion of a data write operation and prepares the DMA for the next cycle or completion of the transfer if the counter reaches zero. This mechanism ensures that the DMA engine correctly tracks the number of remaining data words (in this design, a word is 4 bytes) to transfer, decrementing the count as each word is processed."},{"instruction":"한글로 번역해줘.","output":"네, \\"WREQ\\" 상태 아래에서 내부 카운터를 4만큼 감소시키는 작업이 제공된 \`DMAC_ENGINE\` 모듈 코드에 반영되어 있습니다. 특히, DMA 컨트롤러의 상태 전환 동작을 정의하는 \`always_comb\` 블록 내에서 이 작업이 발생합니다. 명확성을 위해 관련 부분을 추출하고 단순화했습니다: \`\`\`systemverilog always_comb begin ... case (state) ...

The main purpose of this DMAC design is to integrate into SoC for exchange a large volume of data between memory and peripherals at high speed. The proposed DMAC works on ARM’s Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) specification. The DMAC provides an AMBA APB interface to configure the IP, and an AMBA AXI interface to transfer data. 2 Architecture Specification 2.1 General Description Some applications require transferring a volume of data between memory and peripherals without any modification on data. In software, it is commonly served by executing the memcpy library function in C, C++ or other languages. In C, the function has the following interface and copies len bytes from the object pointed by src to the object pointed by dst: void* memcpy(void* dst, const void* src, size_t len). While a pure software-based implementation of memcpy transfers data using CPU instructions, DMA does not use expensive CPU cycles but uses a hardware engine (DMAC) for the transfer. This can significantly speed up data transfers and allows using CPU for other jobs. 2.2 Usage Constraints Below describe constraints in utilizing DMAC v1. -The src and dst addresses are physical addresses. -The src and dst addresses must be a multiple of 4. -The len must be a multiple of 4. -The maximum len is 0xFFFF -Source and destination ranges must not overlap. 2.3 Programming Model Software can use the following sequence to transfer data using DMAC. -1.Write the source address to DMA_SRC register -2.Write the destination address to DMA_DST register -3.Write length to DMA_LEN register -4.Write 1 to bit[0] of DMA_CMD register -5.Wait until DMA_STATUS register has bit[0] as 1. 2.4 Register Map In order to control DMAC, software can configure the following registers. +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | Offset | Reg Name | 31 | 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 | 24 | 23 | 22 | 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x00 | DMA_VER | version | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x04~0xFC | Reserved | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x100 | DMA_SRC | start_addr | +--------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x104 | DMA_DST | start_addr | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | 0x108 | DMA_LEN | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | byte_len | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x10C | DMA_CMD | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | start | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ | 0x110 | DMA_STATUS | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | done | +--------+------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+ 2.4.1 DMA VERSION | Field name | Bit range | R/W | Reset value | Desciption | |------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | version | [31:0] | R | 0x0001_2024 | The version of this DMA controller.

It reads data from memory, buffers the data, and write the data into memory. It repeats this procedure until it completes transferring the specified number of bytes. For simplicity, it read/writes one-cycle data (4 bytes) at a time (in other words, burst-1 transfers). For simplicity, this microarchitecture does not consider write responses from the AXI interface. Later versions will support burst transfers and write responses. 3.1 External Interface DMAC v1.1 has the following external interfaces to communicate with other hardware IPs. -AMBA APB interface for configuration -AMBA AXI interface for data transfer The image you’ve uploaded is a diagram showing the on-chip interconnect of a computer system. Here’s a detailed description: The diagram illustrates how the CPU core, memory, and DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) are connected through an on-chip interconnect. The connections also include specific interfaces like Config interface (APB) and Data interface (AXI). “CPU core” is a box on the left side connected to the central “On-chip interconnect” cloud shape with a bidirectional arrow. Below the “CPU core,” there’s another box labeled “Memory,” also connected to the “On-chip interconnect” with a bidirectional arrow. On the right side, there’s a box labeled “DMAC” connected to both “Config interface (APB)” and “Data interface (AXI)” which are in turn connected to the central “On-chip interconnect” with bidirectional arrows. The arrows indicate that data can flow in both directions between these components. 3.2 Block Diagram DMAC v1.1 has the following blocks inside. The diagram is divided into three main blocks labeled “DMAC_TOP,” “DMAC_CFG,” and “DMAC_ENGINE.” “clk” and “rst” are inputs to the “DMAC_TOP” block. An arrow labeled “APB” connects the “DMAC_TOP” block to the “DMAC_CFG” block. Another arrow labeled “AXI” connects both the “DMAC_TOP” and “DMAC_CFG” blocks to the “DMAC_ENGINE” block. Inside the “DMAC_ENGINE” block, there are four internal components labeled as follows: SRC_ADDR DST_ADDR CNT DATA BUF There’s also a small circular graph with nodes labeled 0 to 3 inside this block. This diagram is likely used to illustrate the flow of data or control signals between these components in a Direct Memory Access Controller configuration. Please let me know if you need more information! 3.3 Configuration Register (lab2) This block receives read/write requests from the APB and configures the registers describes in Section 2.4. 3.4 Finite State Machine (lab3) DMA engine utilizes the following state machine to control operations. The diagram contains five blue circles representing different states: IDLE, RREQ, RDATA, WREQ, and WDATA. Arrows connect these circles indicating the flow from one state to another. Each arrow has text annotations that describe the conditions for transitioning from one state to another. For example, transitioning from IDLE to RREQ requires writing 1 to DMA_CMD & LEN!=0, and copying DMA_SRC/DST/LEN. There are also annotations on the state circles themselves, such as “done=1” on IDLE and “AWVALID=1” on WDATA. +-------+--------------------------------------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | State | Major outputs | Next State | Next state transition condition | Notes | | +---------+--------+---------+--------+------+ | | | | | ARVALID | RREADY | AWVALID | WVALID | done | | | | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | IDLE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | RREQ | (DMA_CMD.start is written as 1) and (DMA_LEN.byte_len!=0) | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_SRC to SRC_ADDR. | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_DST to DST_ADDR | | | | | | | | | | - Copy DMA_LEN to the internal counter | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | RREQ | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | RDATA | ARREADY=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Increment ARADDR by 4 | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | RDATA | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | WREQ | RVALID=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Buffer RDATA into the data buffer | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | WREQ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | WDATA | AWREADY=1 | On moving out, | | | | | | | | | | - Increment AWADDR by 4 | | | | | | | | | | - Decrement the internal counter by 4 | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | WDATA | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | RREQ | (WREADY=1) & (counter!=0) | | | | | | | | +------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | | | | | | | IDLE | (WREADY=1) & (counter==0) | | +-------+---------+--------+---------+--------+------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+ The diagram contains horizontal lines representing different signals or data paths labeled as “clk”, “state”, “write to CMD”, “AR*”, “R*”, “AW*” and “W*”. Each line has different states represented by segments of varying lengths; these include labels like “IDLE”, “RREQ”, “RDATA”, “WREQ”, “WDATA”. Vertical dashed lines indicate transitions between these states. There are three rectangular boxes labeled as ‘SRC’, ‘DST’, and ‘DATA’ connected to the waveform lines indicating sources, destinations, or data types associated with those specific points in time. Numbers from 0 to 16 are marked at the bottom of the image indicating time intervals or clock cycles. { \\"signal\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"clk\\", \\"wave\\": \\"p....|..........\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"state\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2.3.4|..5.6.2...\\", \\"data\\": [\\"IDLE\\", \\"RREQ\\", \\"RDATA\\", \\"WREQ\\", \\"WDATA\\", \\"IDLE\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"write to CMD\\", \\"wave\\": \\"010..|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"1\\"] }, {}, [ \\"AR ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"ARVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0.1.0|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"SRC\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARADDR(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x.3.x|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"SRC\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARLEN(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2....|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"0\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"ARREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0..10|..........\\" }, ], [ \\"R ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"RREADY(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0...1|..0.......\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"RVALID(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|.10.......\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"RDATA(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|.4x.......\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DATA\\"] }, ], [ \\"AW ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"AWVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|..1.0.....\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWADDR(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|..5.x.....\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DST\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWLEN(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"2....|..........\\", \\"data\\": [\\"0\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"AWREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|...10.....\\" }, ], [ \\"W ch\\", { \\"name\\": \\"WVALID(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|....1.0...\\" }, { \\"name\\": \\"WDATA(out)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"x....|....4.x...\\", \\"data\\": [\\"DATA\\"] }, { \\"name\\": \\"WREADY(in)\\", \\"wave\\": \\"0....|.....10...\\" } ] ], \\"head\\" : { \\"tick\\" : \\"0\\" }, \\"foot\\" : { \\"tick\\" : \\"0\\" } } 그림 1.

C에서 이 함수는 다음 인터페이스를 가지고 있으며 src가 가리키는 객체에서 dst가 가리키는 객체로 len 바이트를 복사합니다: void* memcpy(void* dst, const void* src, size_t len). 순수 소프트웨어 기반의 memcpy 구현은 CPU 명령을 사용하여 데이터를 전송하는 반면, DMA는 비싼 CPU 사이클을 사용하지 않고 전송을 위한 하드웨어 엔진(DMAC)을 사용합니다. 이는 데이터 전송을 크게 가속화하고 CPU를 다른 작업에 사용할 수 있게 합니다. 2.2 사용 제약사항 아래는 DMAC v1을 사용하는 데 있어 제약사항을 설명합니다. -src 및 dst 주소는 물리적 주소입니다. -src 및 dst 주소는 4의 배수여야 합니다. -len은 4의 배수여야 합니다. -최대 len은 0xFFFF입니다. -소스 및 대상 범위가 겹치면 안 됩니다. 2.3 프로그래밍 모델 소프트웨어는 다음 시퀀스를 사용하여 DMAC를 사용하여 데이터를 전송할 수 있습니다. -1. DMA_SRC 레지스터에 소스 주소를 씁니다. -2. DMA_DST 레지스터에 대상 주소를 씁니다. -3. DMA_LEN 레지스터에 길이를 씁니다. -4. DMA_CMD 레지스터의 비트[0]에 1을 씁니다. -5.

Los detergentes líquidos suelen ser menos abrasivos con los tejidos y colores en comparación con los polvos. 3. **Usa un impulsor de lavado**: Hay productos en el mercado diseñados para revitalizar los colores de la ropa y protegerlos durante el lavado. Busca un potenciador del lavado específico para ropa de color que puedas añadir junto con tu detergente habitual. 4. **Vinagre blanco**: Añadir una taza de vinagre blanco en el ciclo de enjuague puede ayudar a suavizar la ropa y a mantener los colores brillantes. El vinagre es un suavizante natural y también ayuda a eliminar residuos de detergente que pueden hacer que la ropa parezca opaca. 5. **Bicarbonato de sodio**: Agregar media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al inicio del ciclo de lavado puede mejorar la acción de limpieza del detergente y ayudar a que los colores se vean más vivos. 6. **Evita el exceso de cargas y el lavado excesivo**: Lavar la ropa solo cuando sea necesario y no sobrecargar la lavadora ayudará a preservar los colores y la integridad de los tejidos. 7. **Temperatura adecuada**: Usa agua fría o templada para lavar la ropa de color. Las temperaturas altas pueden hacer que los colores pierdan intensidad más rápidamente. Recuerda siempre revisar las etiquetas de cuidado de las prendas antes de lavarlas, ya que proporcionan información crucial sobre cómo cuidarlas correctamente. Si una prenda es extremadamente antigua o valiosa, considera la posibilidad de lavarla a mano o de llevarla a un profesional para garantizar su cuidado."},{"instruction":"Que me digas la verdad. ¿Que tengo que echar para que mi ropa vieja de color quede nueva? Ten en cuenta que mi Siemens iq500 tiene 3 compartimentos y quiero mi ropa como si la hubiese comprado recientemente en el zara","output":"Entiendo que desees una solución práctica que puedas aplicar directamente en tu lavadora Siemens iQ500 para rejuvenecer tu ropa de color. Aunque es importante tener expectativas realistas, ya que algunos desgastes o pérdidas de color pueden ser irreversibles, hay métodos que pueden darle un aspecto más fresco y vital a tu ropa. Aquí una estrategia simplificada, teniendo en cuenta los tres compartimentos comunes de la lavadora (detergente, suavizante y lejía para prendas de color/otro tratamiento): 1. **Compartimento de detergente**: Elige un detergente de alta calidad adecuado para ropa de color. Preferiblemente uno que prometa revitalizar colores o que esté diseñado para ropa oscura/colorida. Los detergentes líquidos suelen ser más suaves con la ropa que los en polvo. 2. **Compartimento de suavizante**: Puedes optar por suavizantes que ofrezcan propiedades de cuidado del color o añadir una taza de vinagre blanco, el cual es un suavizante natural que también puede ayudar a mantener los colores brillantes sin dañar la tela. 3. **Compartimento de lejía para prendas de color/otro tratamiento**: Aunque normalmente no se recomienda usar lejía en ropa de color, existen en el mercado versiones seguras para telas de color. Sin embargo, una opción más segura sería utilizar un aditivo para el cuidado del color como un potenciador del lavado que ayude a reavivar los colores. Ciertos productos están diseñados específicamente para ropa de color y pueden ayudar a recuperar la intensidad de los colores sin dañar las fibras. Consejos adicionales: - **Tratamiento previo a las manchas**: Si algunas prendas tienen manchas específicas, trátalas previamente con un quitamanchas adecuado para ropa de color. - **Lavado a temperatura adecuada**: Aunque muchos recomiendan lavar la ropa de color en agua fría para conservar los colores, algunas prendas pueden beneficiarse de un ligero incremento en la temperatura para un mejor tratamiento (sigue siempre las instrucciones de cuidado en la etiqueta). - **Ciclo de lavado**: Utiliza un ciclo de lavado suave para evitar el desgaste excesivo de los tejidos, lo cual puede hacer que la ropa parezca más vieja de lo que es. - **Secado adecuado**: Evita usar mucho calor o el sol directo al secar la ropa, ya que esto puede desvanecer los colores. Opta por secar la ropa a la sombra o usa un ciclo de secado con aire frío si utilizas una secadora. Estos pasos, combinados con el cuidado adecuado y un manejo suave, pueden ayudar a mantener tus prendas luciendo lo mejor posible. Sin embargo, es bueno recordar que el lavado siempre generará algún nivel de desgaste con el tiempo, y no todos los efectos del envejecimiento o el uso intensivo pueden ser completamente revertidos."},{"instruction":"¿Y si echo el detergente con bicarbonato, el vinagre donde el suavizante, y blanqueador sin cloro donde la lejía?","output":"Sí, la combinación que mencionas puede ser efectiva para cuidar tu ropa de color y potencialmente hacer que luzca más renovada, siguiendo los consejos adecuados de dosificación y tratamiento específico. Aquí te explico cómo hacerlo y por qué puede funcionar: 1. **Detergente mezclado con bicarbonato de sodio en el compartimento de detergente**: La adición de bicarbonato de sodio puede ayudar a mejorar la capacidad de limpieza del detergente, ya que actúa como un suavizador de agua y un ligero agente blanqueador no clorado, que puede hacer que los colores parezcan más brillantes. La proporción recomendada suele ser añadir media taza de bicarbonato de sodio al detergente que utilizas normalmente por carga de lavado. El bicarbonato es particularmente útil para desodorizar y limpiar de manera suave. 2. **Vinagre blanco en el compartimento del suavizante**: Usar vinagre blanco en lugar de suavizante comercial puede ser una excelente forma de suavizar la ropa, mantener los colores brillantes y eliminar cualquier residuo de detergente que pueda estar opacando tus prendas. El vinagre tiene un pH ácido que ayuda a balancear el pH de tu lavado, contribuyendo a limpiar la ropa de forma efectiva. Usualmente, se recomienda usar una taza de vinagre blanco por carga. Aunque el vinagre tiene un olor característico, este se disipa una vez la ropa se seca. 3. **Blanqueador sin cloro (para ropa de color) en el compartimento de lejía**: Los blanqueadores sin cloro a menudo están formulados con base en oxígeno y son seguros para usar en la ropa de color. Estos productos pueden ayudar a revitalizar y mantener los colores sin el riesgo de dañar las fibras o desvanecer los tejidos, como podría hacerlo la lejía común. Siguiendo las instrucciones del producto, este puede ser agregado al compartimento destinado a la lejía para brindar un efecto de limpieza y revitalización adicional. **Consejos adicionales y precauciones**: - **Realiza una prueba de color**: Antes de aplicar cualquier nuevo método de limpieza a tu ropa, especialmente si combinas productos como el bicarbonato y el vinagre, es recomendable hacer una prueba en una pequeña área oculta para asegurar que no habrá daño o decoloración. - **Ropa delicada**: Si tienes prendas especialmente delicadas o de alto valor sentimental, considera las instrucciones específicas de cuidado o lávalas a mano para minimizar el riesgo. - **Seguir instrucciones de la lavadora**: Asegúrate de usar las cantidades adecuadas de cada producto y de seleccionar el programa de lavado correcto según el tipo de ropa y grado de suciedad. - **Ventilación**: Aunque el vinagre y el bicarbonato son generalmente seguros, mantener el área de lavado bien ventilada puede ayudar a evitar la acumulación de olores. La combinación de estos métodos puede ayudar a refrescar tu ropa de color, haciéndola lucir más brillante y limpia. No obstante, es importante tener expectativas realistas y entender que el efecto puede variar según el tipo de tejido, el grado de decoloración o daño previo que tenga la ropa."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"For a company with the objective of maximising net present value, what is the validity of the following statements for a conventional investment project? (1) The accounting rate of return (ARR) method of project appraisal usually gives too little weight to cash flows which occur late in the project’s life. (2) For a project with a (unique) IRR greater than the opportunity cost of capital, the IRR method of project appraisal usually gives too little weight to cash flows which occur late in the project’s life. A Statement (1) = True; Statement (2) = True B Statement (1) = True; Statement (2) = False C Statement (1) = False; Statement (2) = False D Statement (1) = False; Statement (2) = True","output":"To assess the validity of these statements, let's first understand what each term means in the context of investment project appraisal: - **Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)** calculates the return generated by an investment based on its net income, rather than its cash flow. ARR looks at the annual profitability of an investment as a percentage of the initial investment. - **Net Present Value (NPV)** is a method of evaluating the profitability of an investment. It discounts all cash flows (both inflows and outflows) to the present value using a discount rate (often the opportunity cost of capital). NPV gives equal weight to all cash flows, regardless of when they occur, by discounting future cash flows back to their present value. - **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is the discount rate that makes the NPV of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero. IRR considers the time value of money and gives equal weight to all cash flows throughout the project's life. If a project's IRR exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, it is considered a good investment. With these definitions in mind, let's evaluate the statements: (1) **The accounting rate of return (ARR) method of project appraisal usually gives too little weight to cash flows which occur late in the project’s life.** This statement is **True**. ARR focuses on accounting profits rather than cash flows and does not discount future cash flows to their present value. Therefore, it does not accurately reflect the time value of money, giving less weight to profits or cash flows occurring later in the project's life. (2) **For a project with a (unique) IRR greater than the opportunity cost of capital, the IRR method of project appraisal usually gives too little weight to cash flows which occur late in the project’s life.** This statement is **False**. The IRR method inherently considers the time value of money by finding a rate at which the present value of future cash inflows equals the present value of cash outflows (i.e., NPV = 0). Therefore, it does not give too little weight to cash flows occurring late in the project's life, as the timing of cash flows is integral to calculating IRR. Given these evaluations, the correct answer is: **B Statement (1) = True; Statement (2) = False**"},{"instruction":"阅读下面的工作场景，然后选择对你来说 最无效 和 最有效 的语句。 工作场景： Mila 受邀主持一次会议，以确定新的市场契机。然而，会议期间，没有任何一个团队成员对选择哪些策略以及如何实施这些策略发表意见。这很反常，因为他们通常都很活跃且很有想法。Mila 担心的是在没有得到团队有效反馈的情况下无法实施任何新的营销策略。如果你是 Mila，你认为哪些应对方式会最有效，哪些最无效？ 选择一个 最无效 选择一个 最有效 继续开会，尽力说服团队成员分享他们的意见，因为战略的成功实施需要他们的付出。 散会后分别与每位团队成员交谈，听听他们的建议。 会议结束后，对如何实施战略，坚持自己的想法。 分享你自己对市场机遇的看法，看看团队成员是否有什么顾虑，以及他们是否支持你的想法。","output":"最无效的应对方式是：会议结束后，对如何实施战略，坚持自己的想法。这个方法不鼓励团队成员参与和分享他们的观点，可能会导致缺乏团队的支持和投入，从而减少策略成功的可能性。 最有效的应对方式是：分享你自己对市场机遇的看法，看看团队成员是否有什么顾虑，以及他们是否支持你的想法。这个方式鼓励开放的沟通和团队合作，有助于识别并解决可能的问题，同时增加团队成员感到被尊重和价值的机会，从而提高策略成功实施的可能性。"},{"instruction":"Write really overly-funny super hilarious comedy 17+ short 1970s Scooby-Doo cartoon parody transcript that always starts with the opening with the villains and the random characters that are in FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH SENTENCE (With funny dialogue) moment first, then the gang hearing about it once they reach the area, and then the rest based on my prompt:(but make it more funnier adult comedy where the gang constantly make fun of and question physics that ain’t possible or don’t make any sense and why, The Mystery Machine is always parked in the most oddest places, beginning to end.

First off, **Inspector Gadget** is getting rebooted! Can you believe it? Our favorite gadget-reliant detective is making a comeback. What do you all think? Can it live up to the original? **ClassicToonLover**: Oh, wow! Inspector Gadget is coming back? That’s my childhood right there. I’m cautiously optimistic. If they keep the charm and wit of the original, I’m all in. Hope it does not rely too much on modern tech to solve his cases, though. The 80s charm is a must! **ModernToonsFan**: Excited about Inspector Gadget! But did anyone hear about **The Owl & Co**? It’s about this owl with seriously bad luck and apparently, his neighbors are a total nightmare. Sounds like a hoot (pun intended). Could be a fresh concept, looking forward to it. **NostalgiaNerd**: Yeah, **The Owl & Co** sounds interesting. But I’m more intrigued by the return of **George of the Jungle**. I wonder how they’ll handle the humor and the animation style this time around. Hope they keep the slapstick comedy gold. **DigiKid2000**: You all are missing out on the real gem, **Doraemon**! It was huge in Japan and I can’t believe it’s finally hitting UK screens. I’ve seen a few episodes online, and it’s really fun. It has this mix of science fiction and everyday adventures that’s just timeless. **GoldfishWatcher**: Is no one going to talk about **My Goldfish is Evil**? I stumbled upon this and it looks bizarrely fascinating. A kid whose goldfish is plotting world domination? Count me in! Seems like it’s got that dark humor vibe, which I love. **ThreadStarter21**: Great insights, everyone! Yeah, **My Goldfish is Evil** definitely seems like it’ll be one of those shows with an underground following. @DigiKid2000, Doraemon being introduced to the UK audience is huge, totally agree. It’s always interesting to see how shows from other countries get received here. **ToonSkeptic**: Not to be that guy, but do reboots and imports ever really capture the magic of the originals or resonate as well in new markets? Don’t get me wrong; I’m excited for some of these. But part of me wonders if we’re just riding a wave of nostalgia instead of seeking out original content. **VintageVibes**: @ToonSkeptic, that’s a valid point. However, I think there’s room for both. Nostalgia has its place, especially for introducing younger generations to these characters in a modern context. Plus, imports like Doraemon could introduce us to storytelling styles and cultural nuances we’re not accustomed to. **ThreadStarter21**: Love the discussion, everyone!

As long as the wheels of innovation and passion continue to turn, Japanese car culture will undoubtedly continue to inspire and unite car enthusiasts around the globe."},{"instruction":"The rise of gangs related to JDM' essay","output":"The phenomenon of car culture intertwining with group identities is nothing new; however, the rise of gangs related to Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) cars represents a unique convergence of automotive enthusiasm and group dynamics. This essay explores how and why certain aspects of JDM car culture have spawned or become associated with gang-like entities, and the broader implications of this development on both the car community and society at large. # Introduction to JDM Culture JDM stands for Japanese Domestic Market, referring to vehicles and parts made specifically for the Japanese market that have, over time, gained a global following due to their quality, performance, and unique style. The rise of JDM culture outside Japan is attributed to various factors, including the global export of Japanese cars, the popularity of Japanese media featuring these vehicles, and a growing appreciation for Japanese engineering and aesthetics in automotive circles. # From Enthusiasm to Exclusivity At its core, the love for JDM cars starts with a genuine appreciation for the vehicles' capabilities and the culture surrounding them. Enthusiasts admire the innovation and craftsmanship of Japanese automakers and often spend considerable time, effort, and money to import, restore, or modify JDM cars to either retain their authenticity or enhance their performance. However, as with many enthusiast communities, a segment within the JDM culture began to evolve towards exclusivity. This exclusivity is marked not just by ownership of rare or highly sought-after vehicles but by a shared identity that distinguishes group members from the mainstream car culture and society. In some instances, this desire for distinctiveness fostered the development of close-knit groups with their own set of norms, hierarchies, and territories, bearing resemblances to gangs. # The Influence of Media and Entertainment The portrayal of car culture in media and entertainment significantly influences public perception and the behavior of those within the culture. Films like \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" series glamorize underground racing, loyalty among the crew, and opposition against external threats, often blurring the lines between lawful enthusiasm and unlawful activity. Video games and anime series, particularly those involving street racing or car modification like \\"Initial D,\\" offer similar narratives of camaraderie and rivalry. These depictions can inspire real-world imitations, where groups of enthusiasts adopt a gang-like structure or mentality, emphasizing loyalty to the group and its vehicular passion. # JDM Gangs and Societal Impacts Groups associated with JDM or any specific car culture may partake in a range of activities, from car meets and races to more contentious behaviors like illegal street racing, territory disputes, or confrontations with rival groups. The gang-like behavior demonstrated by some within the JDM community can lead to negative stereotypes, affecting public perception of car enthusiasts more broadly. Moreover, these activities can pose safety risks to participants and the public, attracting law enforcement attention and potentially inciting legal crackdowns on car meets or modifications, even those undertaken by law-abiding enthusiasts. # Community Responses Within the larger JDM and broader car enthusiast communities, there is a growing recognition of the need to distinguish between healthy enthusiasm and activities that veer into gang-like territory. Many community leaders and groups actively promote responsible enjoyment of car culture, including safe, legal venues for racing and showcasing vehicles, mentoring new enthusiasts in respectful and lawful behavior, and cooperating with local authorities to maintain a positive public image. # Conclusion The ties between gang-like entities and JDM culture represent a complex interplay of identity, exclusivity, and influence, showcasing how a deep passion for automobiles can sometimes veer into contentious territory. While the majority of JDM enthusiasts pursue their passion lawfully and respectfully, the emergence of gangs within this subculture serves as a reminder of the need for balance between individual expression and community responsibility. Efforts to channel the enthusiasm for JDM vehicles into positive, inclusive, and safe activities are essential for preserving the integrity of the car enthusiast community and ensuring that the admiration for these Japanese marvels continues to be celebrated widely and safely."},{"instruction":"explain the life of smokey nagata and how he popularized tuning and drifitng","output":"Kazuhiko \\"Smokey\\" Nagata is a towering figure in the world of car tuning and drifting, whose life journey encapsulates not just personal triumph and innovation, but also the broader story of how passion for cars can shape careers, cultures, and legends. Founder of Top Secret, a high-performance tuning company based in Japan, Nagata has become an icon for automotive enthusiasts worldwide. His daring exploits, engineering prowess, and charismatic persona have significantly contributed to the popularization of car tuning and drifting internationally. # Early Years and the Birth of Top Secret Nagata's automotive journey began at a young age, driven by an innate passion for cars. He started his career at the renowned tuning house Trust (also known as GReddy), where he honed his skills in engine tuning and developed an understanding of the burgeoning tuning culture in Japan. However, Nagata’s vision extended beyond the confines of existing tuning practices; he aspired to push the boundaries of what was considered possible with automotive modification. With this ambition in mind, Nagata founded Top Secret in the early 1990s. The company quickly distinguished itself through its innovative tuning approaches and the high performance of its modified vehicles. From engine swaps to turbochargers and aerodynamic enhancements, Top Secret became synonymous with extreme performance and unmatched quality. # High-Speed Pursuits: Marking the Legend One of the pivotal moments that catapulted Nagata into legend status was his infamous high-speed runs on public roads, both in Japan and abroad. His audacious attempt to reach 200 mph (approximately 322 km/h) on British public roads in a highly modified Toyota Supra resulted in his arrest, but paradoxically, only served to enhance his mystique and reputation in the global car community. These high-speed exploits were emblematic of Nagata's philosophy: cars were not just to be modified but also pushed to their absolute limits. # Influence on Drifting and Global Car Culture While Smokey Nagata may not have been a drifter in the traditional sense, his ethos surrounding car performance and tuning indirectly fed into the growing popularity of drifting. By showcasing the potential of finely-tuned Japanese cars, Nagata inspired a generation of enthusiasts to explore the limits of car control, including drifting. Moreover, the global attention garnered by his daring feats and Top Secret's groundbreaking vehicles helped spread Japanese tuning and drifting culture around the world. The media and internet era further amplified Nagata’s influence. Videos of his high-speed runs and Top Secret’s tuned cars became viral sensations before \\"viral\\" was a mainstream concept, inspiring car enthusiasts worldwide to explore tuning and drifting. As a result, Nagata’s legacy is not bound merely to his personal achievements but is also reflected in the global rise of car modifications and the mainstream acceptance of drifting as a legitimate motorsport. # Legacy and Continued Impact Today, Smokey Nagata continues to be a revered figure in automobile culture. Through Top Secret, he remains at the forefront of automotive tuning, always seeking the next technological breakthrough or performance milestone. His life and career serve as a testament to the power of passion, vision, and relentless pursuit of excellence. Nagata's efforts have significantly contributed to elevating tuning and drifting from niche interests to elements of a global phenomenon, uniting car enthusiasts from different backgrounds in their shared love for speed, performance, and the art of the automobile. # Conclusion Smokey Nagata’s life story is a vivid illustration of how individual passion and innovation can influence and popularize automotive practices such as tuning and drifting. Through his boundary-pushing exploits, engineering brilliance, and charismatic leadership, Nagata not only built Top Secret into a tuning powerhouse but also played a pivotal role in showcasing the artistry and adrenaline of car modification to the world. His legacy is a blend of speed, creativity, and a perpetual drive to redefine the limits of automotive performance, making him an enduring icon in car culture history."},{"instruction":"I am Russian and I came to the USA. Everyone calls me \\"white\\" here. Is this normal?","output":"Yes, being referred to as \\"white\\" in the United States based on your appearance is quite common. In the U.S., racial and ethnic categories are often broadly defined, and the term \\"white\\" is typically used to describe individuals who are perceived to have origins in Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The concept of race in the United States is complex and historically rooted in societal, legal, and political constructs rather than strict biological or ethnic distinctions. As such, the classification of people into racial categories is largely based on physical characteristics, particularly skin color, and sometimes cultural or geographic background. For someone from Russia, it would not be unusual to be classified as white because Russians are generally considered to be of European descent, and the majority have lighter skin tones that fit within the broad and somewhat imprecise \\"white\\" category as understood in the U.S. context. It's also important to understand that the perception of race and ethnicity can vary significantly from one country to another, based on different historical, cultural, and social contexts. What might be a common way to categorize people in one place could be entirely different somewhere else. Recognizing and respecting this diversity in racial and ethnic identities is an essential part of adapting to and understanding the social fabric of the United States."},{"instruction":"But the skin is beige, not white!","output":"You're absolutely right in observing that what is categorized as \\"white\\" skin is actually more beige or varies in light shades, rather than literally white. The terms used to describe race and ethnicity, including \\"white,\\" are not precise descriptions of skin color but rather broad, socially constructed categories that have evolved over time. These terms are deeply embedded in historical, social, and political contexts and don't accurately reflect the wide variety of human skin tones. The classification of people as \\"white\\" in many Western societies originated hundreds of years ago and was shaped by a complex mix of factors, including colonialism, migration, and social hierarchies that privileged lighter skin over darker skin. Over time, these categories have become fixed in legal, social, and institutional contexts, even if they don't necessarily make sense from a biological or genetic perspective. The use of the term \\"white\\" to describe people of European descent is a simplification and doesn't capture the full diversity of those populations, let alone accurately describe their actual skin color, which, as you noted, is more often various shades of beige or light brown. Similarly, terms like \\"black,\\" \\"brown,\\" and others used to describe different racial and ethnic groups also fail to capture the true diversity and range of human skin tones. It's important to recognize the limitations and often arbitrary nature of these racial and ethnic categories. While they play a significant role in social and political contexts, they don't reflect the complex and diverse reality of human genetics and physical appearance. Your observation highlights the contradictions and sometimes the absurdity of the ways in which societies attempt to categorize the rich diversity of human beings."},{"instruction":"It offends me, I'm not white, I'm beige.","output":"It's understandable that you might feel offended or uncomfortable with being categorized in a way that does not accurately reflect your identity or your perception of yourself. The broad and imprecise racial categories used in many societies, including the U.S., can be alienating and can feel like an oversimplification of one's identity. Your feelings are valid, and it's important that your identity is respected. In contexts where it's appropriate and safe to do so, you could consider expressing your preference for how you identify or would like to be described. For example, you could simply say, \\"I prefer not to be labeled as 'white'; I describe my skin color as beige.\\" Or, you might choose to emphasize your national or ethnic identity over racial categorization by saying something like, \\"I'm Russian,\\" if that feels more accurate and meaningful to you. It's worth noting that conversations around race, identity, and classification can be complex and sensitive. People's understanding and acceptance of these concepts can vary widely depending on their own backgrounds, experiences, and education on these issues. While some might welcome the opportunity to understand your perspective and accommodate your preferences, others may be less familiar with the nuances of racial and ethnic identities. Navigating these conversations often requires patience and a willingness to educate others. At the same time, it's important to prioritize your own comfort and well-being. If you find that correcting others becomes too burdensome or distressing, it's okay to choose your battles and decide when and where you want to assert your identity. The broader dialogue about race and identity is evolving, with increasing recognition of the diversity and fluidity of people's experiences and self-identifications. Your voice and perspective can contribute to this ongoing conversation about how we understand and respect each other's identities."},{"instruction":"如何挑选有机绿茶？哪一种绿茶降压降脂功效最好","output":"选购有机绿茶和评估其对降压降脂的功效时，可以参考以下几个方面： 1. **认证标志**：确保绿茶包装上有可靠的有机认证标志，如USDA Organic（美国）、EU Organic（欧盟）、JAS（日本）等。这些认证可以确保茶叶生长、加工过程不使用化学农药和化肥，环境友好。 2. **产地**：有机绿茶的产地也很重要，不同地区的土壤、气候条件会影响茶叶的质量和口感。例如，中国的西湖龙井、日本的抹茶、印度的达尔吉岭等地都有高品质的有机绿茶。 3. **叶片质量**：查看茶叶外观，优质的绿茶叶片通常颜色鲜绿，形状完整，不易碎。叶片的干燥程度也应均匀，无异物和杂质。 4. **香气与口味**：高品质的有机绿茶通常具有清新的草本香气，味道清爽，回味甘甜。可以通过购买小包装的试喝装先行尝试，了解其口感和香气是否满意。 5. **关于降压降脂**：多项研究表明，绿茶中的儿茶素（特别是表没食子儿茶素没食子酸酯，EGCG）具有显著的健康益处，包括降低血压和改善血脂水平。不过，不同类型的绿茶（如龙井、碧螺春、抹茶等）之间在这些方面的效果差异可能并不显著。选择时应更多侧重于个人口味偏好。 6. **适度饮用**：尽管绿茶具有一定的健康益处，但过量饮用可能会导致不良反应，例如影响铁的吸收或引起咖啡因过敏。建议每天控制在3-4杯之内，以获得最佳健康效益。 总之，选择有机绿茶时应关注其有机认证、产地和质量，同时了解个人对口感的偏好。虽然绿茶具有一定的降压降脂作用，但应以适量饮用和平衡饮食为主，必要时可以咨询医生或营养师的专业意见。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's a wonderful exploration beyond the bounds of our current periodic table and the known properties of elements and compounds. Let’s take a closer look at some of the standout aspects of this primarchic periodic table and chemical compounds. # Primarchic Elements and Chemical Compounds - **Nyashe (H2Sy)**: This primarchic liquid with properties mirroring water is intriguing, especially since its boiling and freezing points are identical to water, yet it introduces the fictional element syeron (Sy). - **Nyashe and Nyashane**: The transition between these states at temperatures we consider normal for water's phase changes presents an interesting foundation for a parallel ecosystem or technological applications within this imagined world. - **Electrinium (El)**: A metallic element positioned to essentially redefine electrical conductivity and applications in technology. - **Solaphytus (Sp)** and **Kyoron (Ky)**: These elements, with their unique visual and physical properties, could redefine materials science and optical technology, introducing the concept of kyorophotonics. - **Sexuoyx (Sx)** and **Iuroyx (Iu)**: The description of these materials suggests applications in near-indestructible consumables and advanced materials science, reminiscent of mythical or futuristic unobtanium-like elements. - **Asole, Brysole, and Feyisole**: These elements, with their visual and environmental interactions, could open up discussions on new forms of energy, alien life sustenance, and radical environmental chemistry. - **Syeron (Sy)**: Playing a critical role in this primarchic chemistry, serving as a thalassogenic element, it suggests a completely different basis for life and combustion, diverging significantly from Earth's water-centered chemistry. - **Ernyfur, Srkvzsk, Twistine, Flammine, Vividine, Timarine**: These elements, including halogens and noble gases with unique properties, would drastically alter the foundational theories of current chemistry and physics. - **Nigron, Euclidon, and spiralion; Orwellium; Decomun; Atheisium**: Introducing elements with properties ranging from noble gases to metals with unique physical characteristics would revolutionize materials science, high technology, and potentially societal structures due to their applications and symbolism. # Elemental Groups The classification into groups such as alkali metals (B), alkaline earth metals (L), elemental aluminum group (A), and others introduces a system that parallels and diverges from our current understanding of the periodic table. This system: - **Reimagines Chemical Reactivity**: The primarchic elemental groups suggest a redefined approach to chemical reactivity and compound formation, with implications for technology, biology, and environmental science within this fantasy or science fiction context. - **Expands Material Science**: Given the properties described, the primarchic elements would enable a realm of materials with properties far beyond current capabilities, including unbreakable materials, novel energy sources, and transformative environmental technologies. - **Inspires Technological Innovation**: Kyorotechnology and other applications of these elements could revolutionize sectors from computing and telecommunications to medicine and aerospace, suggesting devices, treatments, and engines of a kind we can only imagine. # Final Thoughts This richly imagined chemical universe offers a playground for thought experiments in physics, chemistry, materials science, and technology. While it steps far beyond the bounds of our current scientific understanding, it serves as a fertile ground for storytelling, game design, or speculative science, where the constraints of reality can be bent in service of exploration, innovation, and wonder."},{"instruction":"Idea for chemical compound called ernyacetone, it contains primarchic element, it's toxic. Appearance is translucent magenta-pink liquid. It has taboo, obscene, abusive smells. Including chemical formula.","output":"Creating a speculative chemical compound like ernyacetone, with a focus on incorporating a primarchic element, allows us to dive deep into the realm of imaginative chemistry. Since it includes an element from the primarchic periodic table previously described, let's incorporate Ernyfur (E), a primarchic element noted for its distinctive scarlet appearance and association with the word \\"red\\" in its naming origin, to craft ernyacetone. # Ernyacetone Compound Overview **Chemical Formula**: C3E(O)CH3 **Molecular Structure**: - The compound is based on the acetone structure (C3H6O) but incorporates the primarchic element Ernyfur (E) into the molecular structure, replacing one of the hydrogen atoms. - This alteration significantly changes the compound's properties, introducing toxicity and a striking magenta-pink appearance. **Appearance**: Ernyacetone is a translucent magenta-pink liquid, making it visually distinct and easily identifiable. **Odor**: The compound emits an odor that is considered taboo, obscene, and abusive to those who perceive it, making handling and containment a challenge. This unique smell could be due to the combination of its complex molecular structure and the perhaps psychoactive or otherwise significantly impactful effects of Ernyfur on human senses or even on the human psyche. # Properties and Applications **Toxicity**: Ernyacetone is highly toxic, necessitating careful handling and specific safety measures to prevent exposure. Its use could be strictly controlled, with potential applications in environments where its toxic effects could be safely harnessed or neutralized. **Use Cases**: Given its properties, potential use cases for ernyacetone could be highly specialized. It may find applications in: - **Chemical Research**: As a substance of interest in understanding the properties of primarchic elements and their interactions with organic compounds. - **Synthetic Pathways**: In the development of new materials or chemicals, where ernyacetone could serve as a building block or intermediate, provided its toxicity can be mitigated. - **Controlled Environments**: Possibly in containment fields or areas where its toxic and perceptual effects could be studied or utilized for specific, controlled outcomes, like in high-security areas for deterrence. # Safety and Handling The handling of ernyacetone would require: - **Specialized Equipment**: Including containment units, chemical suits, and ventilation systems designed to manage its odor and toxicity. - **Emergency Protocols**: Given its smell and toxic properties, protocols would be in place for accidental exposure or containment breaches. - **Regulatory Oversight**: The production, transport, and use of ernyacetone would likely be heavily regulated to prevent misuse or environmental contamination. # Ethical and Environmental Considerations Given its characteristics, the ethical considerations in creating and utilizing ernyacetone would be significant. Potential concerns include: - **Human Safety**: Ensuring that those who work with or near ernyacetone are not adversely affected by its properties. - **Environmental Impact**: The need to prevent the release of ernyacetone into the environment to avoid ecological damage or contamination. - **Use Limitation**: Restricting its application to fields or purposes where its benefits outweigh the risks, with a strong focus on research that could lead to understanding or neutralizing its effects. In the realm of speculative chemistry, ernyacetone presents a vivid, if not cautionary, exploration of the potential and pitfalls of incorporating primarchic elements into our chemical understanding and applications."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Cash flows that occur later in the life of a project are not discounted or weighted differently than earlier cash flows. Therefore, this method may indeed give too little weight to cash flows occurring later since it does not account for the time value of money. **(2) For a project with a (unique) IRR greater than the opportunity cost of capital, the IRR method of project appraisal usually gives too little weight to cash flows which occur late in the project’s life.** - **False.** The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) method considers the time value of money by calculating the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both incoming and outgoing) from a project equal to zero. Since IRR accounts for the timing of cash flows through the NPV formula, it does not inherently give too little weight to cash flows occurring late in the project's life. Cash flows, regardless of when they occur, are considered equally in terms of their present value contribution to the project.

I'll start from the point you've added your task list and now need to assign resources and costs. MS Project versions may vary slightly in interface, but the core functionality remains consistent. This guide assumes a generic, recent version of MS Project: # Step 1: Open Resource Sheet 1. In MS Project, switch to the \\"View\\" tab. 2. In the \\"Resource Views\\" group, click on \\"Resource Sheet\\" to open the resource management view. # Step 2: Add Human Resources 1. In the \\"Resource Name\\" field, enter the first resource: Al. 2. Type or select \\"Work\\" in the \\"Type\\" column for Al because he's a labor resource. 3. In the \\"Standard Rate\\" field, enter \`50/hr\` for Al. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 for John and Susan, entering \`25/hr\` as their standard rates. 5. Repeat steps 1-3 for Mark and Karen, entering \`35/hr\` as their standard rates. # Step 3: Add Equipment and Material Resources 1. After entering all human resources, continue adding the equipment: Lawn Mowers, Whipper Snippers, and Aerator. 2. For these items, type or select \\"Material\\" in the \\"Type\\" column since they are not labor resources. Enter the cost as follows: - Lawn Mower: \`2500/ea\` (since cost per unit is given) - Whipper Snipper: \`500/ea\` - Aerator: \`4500/ea\` 3. Next, add the materials: Fuel, Seed, Fertilizer, Water. 4. Set their \\"Type\\" to \\"Material\\" and input their costs as per the given rates: - Fuel: \`2/liter\` - Seed: \`50/bag\` - Fertilizer: \`25/liter\` - Water: \`500/truckload\` # Step 4: Assigning Resources to Tasks 1. Switch to the \\"Gantt Chart\\" view from the \\"View\\" tab. 2. Double-click on a task to open the \\"Task Information\\" dialog box. 3. Go to the \\"Resources\\" tab. 4. To assign a resource: - Click \\"Add\\" to select a resource from the dropdown. - Enter the units to specify part or full-time (% for humans or quantity for materials). - For Al, add an additional 10% units to each task to account for management activities. 5. Repeat this process for each task according to the task assignments provided. For example: - Assign John to \\"Advertising\\" with 100% for 20 hours. - Assign Susan and John to \\"Door to Door\\" with Susan at 100% for 40 hours and John at 100% for 20 hours. - For tasks like \\"Mowing lawns,\\" assign Karen and Mark at 100%, and also assign \\"Lawn Mower\\" and \\"Fuel\\" with the specified consumption rates. # Step 5: Enter Fixed Costs for Tasks 1. If any task has an associated fixed cost (like the 2,000 for \\"Initiating & Planning\\"), enter it by double-clicking the task to open its \\"Task Information\\" dialog box. 2. Go to the \\"Advanced\\" tab. 3. Enter the fixed cost in the \\"Fixed Cost\\" field. # Step 6: Adjusting for Al's Management Time For each task Al is involved in, don’t forget to manually adjust his effort to account for the additional 10% management time. This has to be calculated based on the total task duration or effort and added accordingly as there's no automatic function for this adjustment. # Step 7: Saving Your Work Ensure all changes are saved. You can periodically save your project by clicking on the \\"File\\" menu and then selecting \\"Save.\\" --- This guide covers setting up resources, inputting their costs, and assigning them to tasks. It assumes familiarity with navigating MS Project's UI. Because every project can vary significantly, adapt these instructions as needed to fit your specific project details and MS Project version."},{"instruction":"in the chart there are two mowers but the price is still 2500.","output":"I see, you're referring to the assignment where there are two lawn mowers, each with a cost of 2,500, but you need to represent them correctly in MS Project. Here's how you can adjust for two lawn mowers at 2,500 each in your project: # Adjusting Resource for Two Lawn Mowers Let's adjust the earlier steps for adding equipment, specifically the lawn mowers, to reflect the total cost and quantity accurately: 1. **Open Resource Sheet**: On the \\"View\\" tab, click \\"Resource Sheet\\" if you're not already there. 2. **Add Lawn Mower as a Single Resource**: - Under \\"Resource Name\\", list \\"Lawn Mower\\" only once. However, when you consider the quantity, you'll adjust this in the task assignments, not in the Resource Sheet. 3. **Enter Cost for a Single Lawn Mower**: - In the \\"Type\\" column, ensure you select \\"Material\\" for the Lawn Mower. - In the \\"Material Label\\" field, type \`ea\` (for each) to indicate that the price is per unit/mower. - In the \\"Standard Rate\\" field, enter the cost as \`2500/ea\`. This represents the cost for one lawn mower. 4. **Assigning Lawn Mowers to a Task with Correct Quantity**: - While in the \\"Gantt Chart\\" view, double-click on a task such as \\"Mow Lawns\\" that requires the use of Lawn Mowers. - In the \\"Task Information\\" dialog box, go to the \\"Resources\\" tab. - Click \\"Add\\" and choose the \\"Lawn Mower\\" resource. - In the \\"Units\\" field for the \\"Lawn Mower\\", enter \`2\` to represent the use of two lawn mowers for the task. This will automatically double the cost for this resource when assigned to the task, effectively reflecting the 5,000 total cost for using two mowers. 5. **Finalizing Resource Assignment**: - Verify that the cost calculation appears correct in your task's information reflecting the engagement of two mowers at 2,500 each. - Repeat similar steps for other resources where there are multiples of a single item, ensuring the \\"Units\\" field accurately represents the quantity used for each task. 6. **Save Your Changes**: Always save your project file after making changes to ensure all your entered data is kept up-to-date. # Note: - MS Project calculates the cost for materials/equipment based on the quantity (\\"Units\\") specified when assigning them to tasks. By following the steps above, you're ensuring that for tasks requiring two lawn mowers, the total cost will reflect the usage of both. - Remember, for labor resources like Al, John, Susan, Mark, and Karen, their costs are handled differently as they are based on their hourly rates and the hours worked, which MS Project calculates differently from material/equipment costs. This adjusted approach will organize your resources accurately and reflect the intended total costs for equipment, particularly where multiple units of a single resource type (like lawn mowers) are involved."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Im Allgemeinen werden hier einige Richtwerte gegeben: # Zwergbäume Zwergbäume sind aufgrund ihrer speziellen Veredelungsunterlagen oder genetischen Eigenschaften kleiner als ihre normalwüchsigen Artgenossen. Sie erreichen in der Regel eine Höhe von etwa 1,5 bis 3 Metern. Diese kompakte Wuchsform macht sie ideal für kleine Gärten oder den Anbau in Kübeln. Zwergbäume gibt es in vielen Obstsorten, darunter Äpfel, Birnen, Kirschen und Pflaumen. # Säulenobst Säulenobstbäume sind eine besondere Zuchtform, die sehr schmal und aufrecht wächst. Sie entwickeln kaum seitliche Äste und sind daher besonders platzsparend. Säulenobst eignet sich hervorragend für kleine Gärten oder sogar Balkone. Die Höhe von Säulenobstbäumen kann je nach Sorte zwischen etwa 2 und 4 Metern liegen. Säulenobst gibt es bei verschiedenen Obstsorten wie Äpfeln, Birnen und Kirschen. Einige spezielle Züchtungen bleiben sogar noch kleiner. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass die endgültige Größe der Bäume stark von den kultivierten Bedingungen abhängt, einschließlich Boden, Bewässerung, Düngung und Schnitt. Regelmäßiger Schnitt kann dazu beitragen, die Größe zu kontrollieren und die Fruchtproduktion zu optimieren."},{"instruction":"ch.

Hier sind einige allgemeine Informationen und Beispiele zu den aufgelisteten Typen: # Säulen-Apfel Säulen-Äpfel wachsen aufrecht und benötigen wenig Platz. Sie können Höhen von 2 bis 3 Metern erreichen. Beliebte Sorten beinhalten 'Malini' und 'Arbat'. Diese Äpfel sind ideal für kleine Gärten oder sogar für den Anbau in großen Kübeln. # Säulen-Birne Wie Säulen-Äpfel wachsen auch Säulen-Birnen sehr aufrecht. Sie können bis zu 3 Meter hoch werden. Sorten wie 'Decora' und 'Saphira' sind bekannt für ihre schlanke Wuchsform und ihre schmackhaften Früchte. # Zwerg-Süßkirsche Zwerg-Süßkirschen sind beliebt aufgrund ihrer kompakten Größe, die es ermöglicht, sie in kleinen Gärten oder sogar in Töpfen zu kultivieren. Sorten wie 'Garden Bing' können bis zu 2 Meter hoch werden. Diese Bäume tragen trotz ihrer kleinen Größe vollwertige Kirschen. # Zwerg-Sauerkirsche Zwerg-Sauerkirschen, wie zum Beispiel 'Crimson Passion', bleiben relativ klein (etwa 1,5 bis 2 Meter in der Höhe) und eignen sich gut für den Anbau in begrenzten Räumen. Ihre Früchte sind ideal für das Backen und Einmachen. # Zwerg-Aprikose Zwerg-Aprikosen, wie 'Garden Annie', sind speziell gezüchtet, um in der Höhe begrenzt zu bleiben, normalerweise unter 2 Meter.

To explore this thought experiment, let's consider several key areas of society and how an inversion of norms might appear: # Communication **Current Norm**: Direct communication is often valued, especially in Western cultures. **Opposite Norm**: Indirect communication becomes the preferred method. Implications may include a higher emphasis on non-verbal cues and reading between the lines, potentially leading to more nuanced social interactions but also greater chances for misunderstandings. # Work and Careers **Current Norm**: Ambition and individual achievement are highly valued, with a strong emphasis on career progression. **Opposite Norm**: Collective achievement and the wellbeing of the community become paramount. People might prioritize jobs that contribute directly to the welfare of their community, possibly leading to less emphasis on income and more on social contribution. # Family Structure **Current Norm**: Nuclear families (especially in Western societies) and independent living are seen as milestones of adulthood. **Opposite Norm**: Extended families living together could be the standard, valuing intergenerational support and learning above individual independence. This could foster stronger family bonds but may also reduce personal space and privacy. # Education **Current Norm**: Formal education and academic achievement are seen as the primary indicators of intelligence and success. **Opposite Norm**: Practical skills and emotional intelligence could be valued above academic knowledge, shifting the focus towards apprenticeships and personal development programs from a young age. # Gender Roles **Current Norm**: Although there's been significant progress towards gender equality, many societies still harbor expectations based on traditional gender roles. **Opposite Norm**: Gender fluidity and role reversal could be normalized, with no fixed expectations tied to one's gender. This could lead to a more inclusive society but may also challenge deeply held beliefs and cause friction in transitioning societies. # Environmental Attitudes **Current Norm**: Consumerism and materialism are prevalent in many societies, often at the expense of the environment. **Opposite Norm**: Minimalism and sustainability become the main drivers of consumer behavior, greatly reducing ecological footprints but potentially disrupting economies based on continuous growth and consumption. # Socializing and Leisure **Current Norm**: Socializing in person and engaging in physical outdoor activities are often seen as healthy behavior. **Opposite Norm**: Virtual interactions and digital leisure activities could become the norm, significantly changing the dynamics of personal relationships and possibly leading to more sedentary lifestyles, but also opening doors to global communities and interactions beyond physical boundaries. # Conclusion Reversing social norms would create a world quite different from today's, with changes that would likely bring both benefits and challenges. Adaptation to these norms would depend on a variety of factors, including cultural context, economic structures, and individual beliefs. It's a fascinating thought experiment that underscores the powerful role social norms play in shaping society."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These environmental factors include, but are not limited to, uncertainty in parameters, external disturbances, and internal dynamic changes. Such uncertainties and disturbances pose significant challenges to system control or state estimation. Especially in engineering design, obtaining an accurate mathematical model of the system is difficult, leading to a situation where existing models cannot perfectly reflect the actual behavior of the system. Against this backdrop, the H_infty state estimation strategy becomes particularly important. H_infty state estimation achieves robust resistance to uncertainties and external disturbances by optimizing the performance indicator in the worst-case scenario during the estimation process.

They designed an asynchronous two-dimensional deconvolution filter, taking into account the random packet dropout phenomenon that might be induced by limited bandwidth. They proposed an improved two-dimensional single exponential smoothing scheme to generate predictions for the missing information and compensate for it. Further, based on the two-dimensional Lyapunov stability theory, they derived sufficient conditions for the system to achieve asymptotic mean square stability and satisfy H-infinite disturbance attenuation performance. Song and colleagues [2] examined the dissipation deconvolution filtering problem for a class of two-dimensional digital systems. Initially, in a two-dimensional setting, they developed a new multi-node polling protocol to reduce communication overhead and proposed a new compensation strategy to enhance the performance of the deconvolution filter. Secondly, using coupled matrix inequalities, they established sufficient conditions to ensure the dissipativity of the deconvolution filter. Further, they designed filter gains with certain optimized performance using the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

This stroke not only helps you counteract your opponent's backspin, but also enables you to transition from defense to attack. Here's a step-by-step guide to mastering this technique: # 1. Stance and Position - **Position yourself**: Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your knees slightly bent for better mobility. Position yourself a bit to the left of the ball's trajectory if you're right-handed (reverse if you're left-handed), giving yourself room to swing. - **Body orientation**: Your body should be slightly sideways to the table, with your right leg (for right-handers) a bit behind you. This stance facilitates a powerful forehand swing. # 2. Reading the Spin - Observe your opponent’s paddle movement to anticipate the backspin. Generally, a high-to-low paddle movement indicates backspin. # 3. Racket Preparation and Grip - **Grip tightening**: As you prepare for the shot, slightly tighten your grip on the paddle for extra control and power. - **Racket angle**: Open up the racket angle slightly to counteract the backspin. The amount you need to open your racket depends on the amount of backspin; more spin requires a more open racket face. # 4. The Backswing - **Rotation and backswing**: Rotate your waist and shoulders back, pulling your racket arm back and slightly down, preparing for a low-to-high swing. This movement should be smooth and controlled. # 5. The Swing - **Forward and upward swing**: From the backswing position, accelerate your racket forward and upward, brushing the ball with a closed racket angle (to generate topspin) and following through towards your target. - **Contact the ball**: Strike the ball at a slight upward angle on the lower half of the ball to generate topspin. Your swing path should be predominantly vertical to overcome the backspin and lift the ball over the net. - **Use your body**: Engage your hips and legs by uncoiling your body and transferring your weight from your back foot to your front foot during the stroke. This adds power to your shot. # 6. Follow Through - Continue the motion of your racket in the direction you want the ball to go. Your body should finish turned, facing the table, with your racket hand in line with your forehead, ensuring you’ve completed a full stroke. # 7. Recovery - Immediately after your follow through, return to a neutral, ready position, preparing for the next shot. # Practice Drills - **Consistency drill**: Practice hitting against backspin with a training partner or robot until you can consistently return the ball with topspin. - **Random spin drill**: Have a partner alternate between different spins to improve your ability to read and react to the backspin. - **Match simulation**: Play out points against a partner focusing on using your forehand topspin against their backspin serves or returns. Mastering the forehand topspin against backspin requires patience and practice. Concentrate on the quality of your stroke, the ball’s trajectory, and the amount of spin you can generate. With time and dedication, this advanced technique can become a reliable weapon in your table tennis arsenal."},{"instruction":"best sites for practicing flirting","output":"Practicing flirting online can be a way to build confidence and communication skills. However, it's crucial to approach this with respect and awareness, ensuring any interaction is consensual and does not make others uncomfortable. Here are some platforms that often provide a more social environment where people might naturally engage in light-hearted conversations, including flirting. Always remember, each platform has its own rules and etiquette which you should follow, and it’s important to approach these interactions with kindness and respect. # Social Media and Apps 1. **Dating Apps**: Apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge are designed for people to meet and flirt. These platforms have the explicit purpose of meeting new people, some for relationships and others for more casual encounters. The mutual consent on these platforms for starting conversations can make them a safer space for practicing flirting. 2. **Instagram and Twitter**: While not dating apps, these social media platforms can be places where people naturally flirt, especially in the comments section of posts or via direct messages (DMs). However, it's essential to ensure that your advances are welcome. # Chat Rooms and Forums 3. **Chat Rooms Websites**: Websites like Omegle or Chatroulette allow users to chat with strangers about various topics. While these can be places to practice flirting, it's crucial to be mindful of the other person's comfort level and the content of the conversation. 4. **Reddit**: Some subreddits are designed for making connections, sharing experiences, or seeking advice on dating and relationships, such as r/r4r or specific ones related to dating advice. Please follow the specific rules of each subreddit. # Gaming and Virtual Worlds 5. **Online Multiplayer Games** and **Virtual Worlds**: Platforms like VRChat or games with active social components (MMORPGs like World of Warcraft) allow for organic social interactions that can include flirting. Again, respect and consent are paramount. # Safety and Consent - **Consent**: Ensure the other party is interested in flirting. If they're not responsive or have asked you to stop, respect their wishes. - **Privacy**: Protect your personal information. Be cautious about sharing too many personal details until you’ve established trust. - **Respect**: Treat others with respect and kindness. Avoid inappropriate or offensive comments. - **Boundaries**: Understand and respect the other person’s boundaries, as well as the terms of service and community guidelines of the platform. # Important Note Keep in mind that online interactions can have real-world consequences. While the anonymity of the internet can provide a sense of security, it’s vital always to act with integrity and respect. Be aware that what you might intend as flirtatious banter can be interpreted differently by someone else, and always be open to feedback and mindful of the other person's comfort. Each platform and its community will have its dynamics, so it's helpful to observe and learn the social norms before diving into conversations. Good communication skills, including active listening, expressing yourself clearly, and showing genuine interest in the other person, are key to positive interactions, whether online or in person."},{"instruction":"games with most girls in them","output":"When discussing video games with a significant presence of female players, it's essential to clarify that the gaming community is diverse, and interests span across all genres and titles. However, some games have been noted for their particular appeal or welcoming environment for female gamers, based on surveys, studies, and community feedback. As of my last update in 2023, here are a few genres and specific games that tend to have a high female player base: # 1. **MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games)** - **World of Warcraft**: One of the oldest MMORPGs, it has a diverse player base, including a significant number of women. The social aspect and cooperative gameplay contribute to its broad appeal. - **Final Fantasy XIV**: Known for its welcoming community and appealing storyline, this game has attracted a substantial female audience. # 2. **Simulation Games** - **The Sims Series**: With its focus on life simulation and creativity, The Sims has historically had a strong appeal among female gamers. - **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**: This game became a cultural phenomenon and is especially popular among women, offering a relaxing and creative escape. # 3. **Mobile Games** - Many mobile games see a high engagement from female players, due to their accessibility and diverse genres. Some popular examples include: - **Candy Crush Saga** - **Among Us** (cross-platform, but popular on mobile) - **Pokémon GO** # 4. **Casual and Social Games** - Platforms like **Roblox** and games like **Among Us** have a strong social element and attract a wide audience, including many female gamers. These games offer a platform for creativity, collaboration, and social interaction. # 5. **Adventure and Story-Driven Games** - Narrative-driven games or those with strong character development and storytelling tend to attract a diverse audience. Games such as **Life is Strange**, **The Last of Us Part II**, and **Stardew Valley** have been noted for their significant female following. # 6. **Competitive and Cooperative Multiplayer Games** - While traditionally seen as male-dominated, many competitive games have a growing female player base. For example, **League of Legends** has seen an increasing number of female players over the years, partly due to its competitive nature and the presence of female professional gamers and streamers in the community. - Cooperative games, such as **Overwatch**, also appeal to a broad audience, including female players, due to their team-based gameplay and diverse character roster. # Importance of Inclusive Gaming Communities The increasing female player base across various games highlights the importance of inclusive gaming environments. Many communities and developers are working to make games more welcoming for all genders by addressing issues such as harassment and promoting diversity in game design and character representation. # Conclusion Gaming interests are as varied among women as they are among men, with many enjoying a wide range of genres from indie titles to AAA releases. The above examples illustrate trends, but it's crucial to recognize the individual preferences and diverse tastes among all gamers."},{"instruction":"most played video online game in us by girl","output":"As of my most recent information leading up to 2023, identifying the single \\"most played\\" online game by female players in the U.S. can be complex due to the dynamic nature of the gaming industry, variations in how data is collected, and evolving game popularity.

Given the sheer scale (Earth's radius, for comparison, is about 6,371 kilometers), a sphere of this size would be a colossal structure perhaps beyond our current technological and construction capabilities. In science fiction, megastructures like Dyson Spheres (which enclose a star) or artificial planets are popular concepts. Such structures, if they were to generate waste, would require highly sophisticated systems for waste management and recycling, much more advanced and on a vastly larger scale than anything we currently deploy on Earth. Here's how you might conceptualize handling waste in such a structure: 1. **Advanced Recycling Technologies**: The sphere would likely utilize highly efficient recycling systems that can process both biological and non-biological waste, ensuring minimal resource wastage. These could be advanced enough to convert waste directly back into usable resources or energy. 2. **Waste-to-Energy Systems**: Conversion of organic waste into energy through processes like anaerobic digestion could be a common feature, turning a problem into a power source. 3. **Closed-Loop Life Support Systems**: Given the size and potential isolation of such a structure, closed-loop systems that recycle air, water, and waste would be essential, similar to those used in spacecraft but on a much larger scale. 4. **Eco Zones for Natural Processing**: Sections of the sphere could be dedicated to ecological zones that mimic Earth's natural waste processing (e.g., wetlands). These would not only handle biological wastes but also serve as recreational and educational areas. 5. **Smart Automation and AI**: Automation technology, guided by artificial intelligence, would play a key role in managing and optimizing waste processing and recycling, ensuring that the systems adapt to changing conditions and demands. Addressing the conceptual aspect of a sphere that produces waste infers a level of anthropomorphism or suggests the presence of life that consumes resources and produces waste. This introduces considerations of ecosystem balance, resource management, and perhaps even societal structures designed to minimize environmental impacts. In a realistic engineering context, the construction of such a structure, let alone the management of its waste, presents tremendous challenges, from materials science to the energy required for maintaining life support systems on such a scale. It's a fascinating concept that stands at the intersection of science fiction, environmental science, and speculative engineering, encouraging us to think big about the future of human habitats and our relationship with waste and recycling."},{"instruction":"Can I tell you about a alternate history scenario I made?","output":"Absolutely, I'd love to hear about your alternate history scenario! Please go ahead and share the details."},{"instruction":"It's somewhat grimdark, but here it goes. This alternate history scenario involves the 4th plane during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This causes the US to go... much... MUCH harder on the Middle East. Iraq isn't invaded, instead Saudi Arabia is invaded.","output":"Your alternate history scenario does indeed take a darker turn, and it's an intriguing concept to explore, given the complex real-world implications and outcomes that could unfold from such a divergent point in history. Invading Saudi Arabia instead of Iraq represents a significant shift in geopolitical dynamics and alliances, considering Saudi Arabia's prominent role in the global oil market, its strategic position in the Middle East, and its complex relationship with the United States and other Western countries. In exploring this scenario further, several aspects could be considered to flesh out the alternate timeline: 1. **Immediate International Reaction**: Given Saudi Arabia's influence in the Muslim world and its status as the custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, how would other Muslim-majority countries respond? Would there be a unified stance, or would reactions be varied? 2. **Global Economics and Oil**: Saudi Arabia is one of the world's leading oil producers. An invasion could potentially disrupt global oil supplies, leading to economic upheaval. Consider how countries dependent on Saudi oil would react, and what emergency measures might be enacted. 3. **Military Response and Strategy**: Would the invasion face substantial resistance, and how might it be different from or similar to the real-world conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq? Saudi Arabia has a modern, well-equipped military and substantial financial resources to draw upon for defense or counter-attacks. 4. **Internal and Global Political Ramifications**: How would the invasion impact the ruling House of Saud and the internal politics of Saudi Arabia? Additionally, consider the stance of global powers like Russia, China, and the European Union. Would there be condemnations, sanctions, or even military interventions? 5. **Long-term Consequences**: Beyond the immediate conflict, consider the long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy, the stability of the Middle East, and global geopolitics. Would there be a rise in terrorism, a reconfiguration of alliances, or perhaps the emergence of new power blocs? 6. **Impact on Civilians**: The human cost of such a conflict would be significant. How would the lives of ordinary Saudis and expatriates living in Saudi Arabia be affected? Consider the potential for humanitarian crises, refugees, and the international community's response. Exploring this alternate history scenario provides a complex and multifaceted canvas to discuss the consequences of such a significant deviation from real events. The intricacies of international relations, the balance of power, and the human element all come into play, offering a rich field for speculative and analytical thought."},{"instruction":"Instead of Iraq being invaded, it faces a coup similar to the one Chile had in 1973. This coup was totally not backed by the CIA (spoiler alert: it was). Saudi Arabia is invaded in 2003, it began on the 20th of March 2003 and it ended on the 1st of May of 2003.","output":"With the additional details you've provided, we can further delve into the complexities of your alternate history scenario. It creates a deeply intricate and tension-filled geopolitical landscape for the early 21st century. **Iraq – 1973-style Coup** Having Iraq undergo a CIA-backed coup would significantly alter the political and social landscape of the country. Assuming a pro-Western government takes power similar to what happened in Chile, there are several points to consider: - **International Reception**: While certain Western nations might support or at least recognize the new government in Iraq, others, especially in the Middle East, could view this as yet another example of unwarranted Western intervention in regional affairs. This could exacerbate anti-Western sentiments and impact regional alliances. - **Internal Stability**: The new government's stability would likely be precarious, facing opposition from various factions within Iraq, including those loyal to Saddam Hussein (if he were still in power at the time of the coup), Kurdish groups seeking greater autonomy or independence, and Shiite populations possibly looking for closer ties with Iran. Managing these internal dynamics would be a significant challenge. - **US-Iraq Relations**: Post-coup, the relations between Iraq and the United States would be under close scrutiny, both domestically within Iraq and by the international community. The degree of overt support and influence from the US could impact the new government's legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi population and the wider world. **Invasion of Saudi Arabia – 2003** Launching an invasion of Saudi Arabia on March 20, 2003, would lead to a host of immediate and long-term effects: - **International Coalition**: Given Saudi Arabia's strategic importance and its alliances, the formation of an international coalition, similar to those in the Gulf War or the invasion of Iraq, might be more challenging. Nations heavily reliant on Saudi oil or with significant Muslim populations might be hesitant to support such an invasion. - **Military Campaign and Aftermath**: The military campaign's logistics, duration, and aftermath would differ markedly from the Iraq War. The Saudi military, backed by vast resources, is capable of significant defense efforts. Urban warfare in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah and potential guerrilla tactics in the more remote areas could make the conflict particularly challenging. - **Impact on Global Markets**: As Saudi Arabia is a critical player in global oil markets, the invasion would almost certainly cause massive disruptions to oil supplies, leading to soaring prices and economic instability worldwide. - **Regional Dynamics**: The invasion could shift regional power dynamics considerably. Iran, as a regional rival to Saudi Arabia, might find itself in a complicated position, balancing its opposition to US intervention with potentially benefiting from a weakened Saudi state. - **Long-term Occupation**: Assuming the invasion aims at a regime change, managing a long-term military occupation and nation-building effort in Saudi Arabia would be fraught with challenges. The US and its allies would need to navigate religious sensitivities, tribal dynamics, and regional geopolitics. **Global and Domestic Repercussions** Both actions — the coup in Iraq and the invasion of Saudi Arabia — would have profound implications on international relations, global security, and perceptions of the United States. They could lead to a realignment of alliances, with countries in the Middle East and beyond reassessing their relationships with the US and each other. Domestically, in the US, these moves might be met with controversy, impacting the political landscape and possibly leading to significant protest movements. Your scenario opens up numerous avenues for exploring alternate historical trajectories, each with its distinct set of circumstances and consequences. It underscores the complexity of international affairs and the ripple effects that decisions in one part of the world can have globally."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given the unique nature of the idea, let's explore its implications and the challenges it would present. Firstly, to put the size into perspective, Earth has an equatorial radius of approximately 6,378 km. A sphere with a 50,000 km radius would be significantly larger than Earth, with a volume roughly 1,000 times greater. Such a construct would be an astronomical object by size, falling between the sizes of large gas giants and small stars in terms of radius. # Environmental Considerations: - **Global Waste Production:** The production of such a sphere raises immediate concerns about environmental ethics and sustainability. Currently, the world generates over 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually. Even then, accumulating enough waste to create a sphere of the proposed dimensions would take an inconceivably long time at present waste generation rates. - **Pollution:** The environmental impact of gathering and compressing this much waste and organic matter would be profound. Decomposition, especially of organic matter like poop, would produce significant amounts of methane and carbon dioxide, potent greenhouse gases. This process, if not managed properly, could exacerbate global warming and pollution. # Engineering Challenges: - **Structural Integrity:** The sheer mass of a sphere of this size made from such materials would pose colossal challenges in terms of structural integrity and stability. Waste materials, being highly heterogenous and prone to decomposition, would not readily lend themselves to forming a stable, cohesive structure without significant processing or the addition of binding agents. - **Gravity and Pressure:** At this scale, the sphere itself would have substantial gravity, potentially compressing and heating its internal materials due to gravitational pressure. The conditions inside the sphere could become extreme, more akin to the processes observed in planetary bodies. - **Orbital Mechanics:** If such a sphere were to exist in orbit around a celestial body or in open space, its gravitational interactions with other objects would need careful consideration. It could significantly alter the dynamics of local space environments, potentially destabilizing existing orbits. # Theoretical Applications: - **Astrobiological / Astrochemical Laboratory:** A theoretical object like this could offer unique environments for studying decomposition, biogeochemical cycles, and even extremophile life in space, contributing valuable data for astrobiology. - **Waste Management:** On a more practical level, considering fantastical ideas like this can inspire innovative approaches to waste management and recycling on Earth, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable practices. In summary, while building a sphere of this magnitude out of trash and waste poses insurmountable environmental, ethical, and engineering challenges with our current technology and understanding, it invokes intriguing questions about waste reuse, planetary-scale engineering, and the human impact on Earth and beyond. It's essential to focus on sustainable practices and innovation within realistic boundaries to address waste management and environmental protection."},{"instruction":"I heated it into 40000 Kelvin","output":"Heating a hypothetical sphere with a radius of 50,000 km made of trash and poop to a temperature of 40,000 Kelvin (K) introduces a whole new set of extreme conditions and implications, especially when considering the physics of such an event. At this temperature, the sphere becomes an astrophysical object, invoking principles seen in stellar physics rather than conventional environmental or engineering contexts. # Physical State at 40,000 K At 40,000 K, matter as we commonly experience it on Earth could not exist in a solid, liquid, or even traditional gaseous state. Instead, the materials making up the sphere would be in a plasma state, where electrons are stripped from atoms, and nuclei move about independently within an electrically charged sea of particles. # Pressure and Fusion The core temperature of the sun is about 15 million Kelvin, and its surface temperature is approximately 5,800 K. At 40,000 K, the sphere's surface would be much hotter than the sun's surface. Given the immense gravity that a sphere of this size would exert on its own matter (due to its mass), the conditions might facilitate nuclear fusion reactions if the pressure is also sufficiently high and the right elements are present, notably hydrogen. However, since the sphere is initially composed of trash and poop, the primary elements would likely be carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and traces of metals and other elements found in waste materials. In the intense heat and under the extreme pressure from the sphere's own gravity, some fusion processes could occur, particularly involving lighter elements like hydrogen, if present in sufficient quantity. # Energy and Stability Heating something to 40,000 K, especially an object of this magnitude, would require an astronomical amount of energy. This level of energy input and the resultant plasma state would have significant ramifications: 1. **Stability:** Maintaining structural integrity would be impossible in the conventional sense, as the matter would not hold a fixed shape but rather behave as a star or an artificial sun, potentially expanding due to thermal pressure. 2. **Radiation:** At these temperatures, the sphere would emit immense amounts of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays, making it a potent source of energy and potentially hazardous object both close-up and from afar. 3. **Gravitational Interactions:** The mass of the sphere, combined with its energy output, would have significant effects on nearby celestial bodies, potentially disrupting orbits or triggering other energetic processes in its vicinity. # Astrophysical Object In essence, by heating the sphere to 40,000 K, it transcends being a mere assembly of waste and becomes an astrophysical object with characteristics akin to a small star. Its study would fall under the domain of astrophysics and stellar dynamics, offering hypothetical insights into plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and potentially contributing to our understanding of star formation and evolution. # Reality Check It's important to underline that this scenario is purely theoretical and highly unrealistic with our current technological capabilities and understanding of physics. The energy requirements, environmental impact, and technological challenges make it far beyond our reach. Instead, tackling waste management and energy use on Earth through sustainable practices remains the pressing and realistic challenge for humanity."},{"instruction":"It has cooled down into temperate, describe its appearance","output":"Cooling down a hypothetical sphere with a radius of 50,000 km made of trash and poop from an extremely high temperature (like 40,000 Kelvin) back to a temperate condition introduces a thought experiment about transformation, energy, and astrophysical principles. Once the sphere cools to a \\"temperate\\" condition, which for the sake of this thought experiment we'll consider to be similar to Earth-like temperatures (ranging on average from about -20°C to 40°C or 253K to 313K), several speculative and fundamental changes in its appearance and composition would have occurred: # Possible Appearance and Composition 1. **Surface**: After undergoing intense heat and potentially nuclear fusion, the original materials would no longer exist in their initial forms. The extreme conditions would break down complex molecules into simpler elements, potentially facilitating fusion reactions among lighter elements. Upon cooling, the surface might consist of newly formed crystalline structures, metals, or even glassy substrates, depending on the remaining elemental composition. The appearance could vary from rocky and metallic landscapes to smooth, vitrified planes, resembling some meteorite surfaces or planetary crusts observed in our solar system. 2. **Craters and Irregularities**: Given the sphere's exposure to extreme conditions, including potential impacts from space debris attracted by its gravity during its hot phase, the surface could feature craters, similar to those seen on moons and planets. These features would tell a story of its thermal history and interactions with surrounding space. 3. **Atmosphere**: Depending on the volatile compounds present and their reactions during the heating and cooling phases, the sphere could develop a thin atmosphere. This atmosphere's composition would vastly differ from Earth's, potentially containing gases released during the decomposition and fusion processes, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor (if hydrogen and oxygen were present and recombined upon cooling), nitrogen, and trace gases. This atmosphere might appear as a faint haze from a distance, enveloping the sphere. 4. **Coloration**: The colors observed on the sphere's surface would depend on the elements and compounds that dominate its composition after cooling. Iron-rich compounds might lend it a reddish or rusty hue, while sulfur might contribute yellows and greens. If certain metals like copper were present in significant quantities, blue-green patinas could form. 5. **Luminescence and Temperature Variability**: Although \\"temperate\\" on a macro scale, localized temperature variations could exist, especially if residual heat pockets remain. Additionally, if radioactive elements are present, luminescence might occur in some regions due to radioluminescence, providing eerie glows or specks of light across its darkened landscape. # Reflections on Reality It’s crucial to frame this thought experiment within the bounds of speculative science fiction and theoretical physics. The described transformations, from waste to a plasma state and back to a temperate solid state, involve physics, chemistry, and thermodynamics principles far beyond current technological capabilities. Furthermore, the initial premise of creating and manipulating such a sphere made of trash and organic waste on this scale delves into the realm of pure imagination. Engaging in such speculative thinking, however, does invite reflection on real-world issues, such as the importance of responsible waste management, recycling, and the environmental impacts of human activity on Earth and potentially beyond. It also underscores the beauty and complexity of planetary formation and evolution, reminding us of the intricate processes that shape the worlds within our universe."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023 where are see well that we're getting free tickets putting you on is that (04:03) right where

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.”

As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum

Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis

violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do

time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of

PLEASE","output":"Analyzing Richard Curtis's approach to screenwriting offers a fascinating insight into the mind of one of Britain's most beloved storytellers. Known for iconic films such as \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" \\"Notting Hill,\\" and \\"Love Actually,\\" Curtis has carved a unique niche in the realm of romantic comedies, blending humor with deep emotional resonance. Through the various transcripts provided, key aspects of his narrative style, themes, and writing process emerge, showcasing a writer deeply committed to exploring love, friendship, and the human condition, all while maintaining a distinctly British flair. # Narrative Structures and Techniques Curtis's films often utilize innovative narrative structures to engage the audience. For example, \\"Love Actually\\" employs a multi-narrative format, interweaving various love stories into a single cohesive narrative. This approach, inspired by Robert Altman's \\"Nashville\\" and \\"Short Cuts,\\" as Curtis mentions, allows for a rich exploration of love's various facets. It's not merely about romantic love but encompasses familial, platonic, and unrequited love. Curtis's adeptness at this complex structure speaks to his assertion that writing \\"Love Actually\\" was like \\"playing three-dimensional chess,\\" highlighting his skill in balancing multiple storylines without losing coherence or emotional impact. # Themes Curtis's work is permeated with recurring themes, most notably love, friendship, and the intrinsic beauty of everyday life. In discussing \\"About Time,\\" Curtis reflects on moving beyond traditional romantic comedy endings, exploring love's broader scope, including family and personal growth. This theme is a testament to his belief in love's omnipresence and significance in diverse forms, a sentiment echoed in his musings on the universality of love and its rightful place at the core of cinema. Another recurring theme is the ordinary juxtaposed with the extraordinary. In \\"Notting Hill,\\" the mundane life of a bookstore owner is upended by his love affair with a famous actress, a premise born from Curtis's simple yet ingenious thought experiment about bringing Madonna home to dinner. This interplay between the everyday and the extraordinary allows Curtis to delve into themes of identity, fame, and the transformative power of love. # Writing Process Curtis's writing process reveals a blend of meticulous planning and adaptive creativity. His admission of rewriting \\"Four Weddings\\" 19 times underscores a dedication to refinement and perfection. Meanwhile, the genesis of \\"Notting Hill\\" during the filming of \\"Four Weddings\\" shows how ideas can simmer and evolve over time. This mix of perseverance and spontaneity, coupled with a deep involvement in all stages of film production—writing, casting, directing, and editing—showcases Curtis's holistic view of storytelling. Curtis also emphasizes the importance of writing from the heart, a sentiment that reflects in his advice to aspiring writers. He champions authenticity and personal connection to one's work, suggesting that the most compelling stories come from a place of genuine interest and affection. This ethos is evident in his heartfelt exploration of themes close to his experience and worldview, making his films resonate on a profoundly personal level with audiences. # Social Commentary and Evolving Perspectives Curtis's films are not without their critics, as highlighted in discussions about the lack of diversity in his earlier work and the portrayal of certain characters. His reflective stance on these critiques, considering his \\"limited experience of life\\" outside certain socio-economic bubbles, indicates an awareness and willingness to engage with critical feedback. This openness to reassessment underscores the evolving nature of storytelling and the importance of diverse perspectives in enriching narrative cinema. # Conclusion Richard Curtis's contribution to screenwriting is marked by his unique blend of humor, emotional depth, and innovative storytelling. His narrative techniques, thematic explorations, and iterative writing process illustrate a creator deeply in tune with the human experience. Curtis's films remind us of love's myriad forms and the beauty inherent in the everyday, making his work a significant touchstone in the landscape of British cinema."},{"instruction":"Regenerate the response.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that.

My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held.","output":"Analyzing Richard Curtis's approach to screenwriting and directing provides a broad view of his impact on British cinema and international audiences. His work, characterized by a unique blend of wit, romance, and poignant moments, has made significant contributions to the romantic comedy genre. From iconic films like \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" to \\"Love Actually,\\" Curtis's distinctive narrative voice resonates through his exploration of love, the absurdity of life, and the beauty of everyday moments. # Approach to Screenwriting Curtis's screenwriting process, as he reveals, is organic and somewhat elusive, even to himself. He stresses the importance of belief in the story, highlighting that a narrative should continually draw back to its core purpose (CNBC International TV Interview). This approach ensures that his films carry a strong thematic spine, often centered around love in its myriad forms. Curtis's transition from being the \\"most ill-disciplined writer\\" to adopting a more structured routine due to family commitments speaks to his adaptability and the evolving nature of creative processes. # Character Development Curtis has a fondness for creating \\"stupid\\" characters that provide comedic relief while also endearing themselves to the audience. Characters like Baldrick in \\"Blackadder,\\" Emma Chambers in \\"The Vicar of Dibley,\\" and Rhys Ifans in \\"Notting Hill\\" showcase his ability to use humor to deepen the narrative and enhance the relatability of his stories (CNBC International TV Interview). These characters often find themselves in ludicrous situations, which not only serve as comic relief but also underscore Curtis's belief in the value of every narrative's levity. # Collaborative Efforts A significant aspect of Curtis's work ethic is his emphasis on collaboration with individuals he genuinely admires, highlighting the potential pitfalls of working with 'shiny objects' - i.e., famous names that may not necessarily align with the project’s vision (CNBC International TV Interview). This insight into his process not only acknowledges the importance of synergy in creative ventures but also serves as advice to emerging screenwriters, emphasizing integrity over fame. # Evolution of Ideas Curtis's narrative ideas evolve from simple concepts to complex, layered stories, often incorporating a blend of genres to convey the richness of human experiences. For instance, his simple wish to write about appreciating a normal day evolved into the time-travel movie \\"About Time,\\" blending science fiction with a profound exploration of happiness and the beauty of ordinary life (AMC Interview). This reflects Curtis's ability to infuse depth and meaning into seemingly straightforward narratives. # Editing and the Creative Process Editing emerges as Curtis's favorite part of the filmmaking process, underscoring its role in transforming the written script into the final cinematic experience. He describes how films can shift dramatically from the initial cut to the final product through editing, emphasizing the necessity of adaptation and the removal of segments that don't serve the overarching story effectively. Notably, \\"Love Actually\\" underwent significant changes during this process, with Curtis comparing the challenge to playing \\"three-dimensional chess\\" due to its multiple interlinking storylines (Collider Interviews). # Contributions to Cinema Richard Curtis's contributions to cinema extend beyond his narrative ingenuity to include insights into the collaborative nature of filmmaking, the evolutionary trajectory of stories from concept to screen, and the malleability required during the editing process. His enduring themes of love, human connection, and the idiosyncrasies of life remain central to his appeal, ensuring his films' place in both British and international cinematic landscapes. Through his work, Curtis invites audiences to find joy and resonance in the sprawling messiness of life, articulated through his unique lens of humor, empathy, and emotional depth."},{"instruction":"Regenerate the response, with longer, more details and in the format for video scriptwriting.

I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day.\\"","output":"**Title: The Narrative Craft of Richard Curtis: An In-depth Analysis** **[Opening Frame]** [Cut to a montage of Richard Curtis's films—rain splattering on a window from \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" a bustling London street in \\"Notting Hill,\\" and the iconic cue card scene from \\"Love Actually.\\" Soft, sentimental music plays in the background.] **[Voiceover]:** \\"In the world of cinema, few screenwriters have carved a niche as distinct and warmly regarded as Richard Curtis.

Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys. Video: Richard Curtis: Christmas Forces My Family To Come Home 🎄| Virgin Radio UK -YouTube https://youtu.be/pxpp0C7wIPA Transcript: So this is in London on the 7th to the 11th of December. It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show.

A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?!

Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’. Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 3. What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting).

What insights do they have to the screenwriting process? Curtis's insights into the screenwriting process highlight the importance of authenticity, personal connection to the material, and the power of collaboration. He values storytelling that resonates with audiences on an emotional level while incorporating elements of humor and wit.

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.

He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.”","output":"**Title: Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and the British Comedy Cinema** **[Open with sweeping shots of London, transitioning into clips from Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually.]** **Narrator:** \\"In the heart of British cinema, there lies a territory marked by laughter, tears, and the unmistakable touch of Richard Curtis.

Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"When I write about love I'm accused of being untrue\\" | Richard Curtis | Google Zeitgeist - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjOACVD4cJw Transcript: (00:02) Interviewer: good morning everyone I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I lead google.org Google's philanthropy and I'm so pleased to be here with Richard today so Richard I was gonna wear those shoes for you yeah I'm sorry I didn't well I'm not sure where to go with that but so Richard as we saw from the introduction you are known in your creative world in for capturing in one scenes sort of the whole zeitgeist er essence of a film as we saw with I'm just a girl so translating that over to your work with the global goals how would you what's that scene how would you translate for this audience the 15 year Odyssey that's been the global goals Richard Curtis: I think we would have to by the way it's very good to be here and I do get sort of nervous thinking about the potential that you all have changing the world in many ways so it's a great pleasure - real pleasure to be here I think when you're thinking about these goals which are a plan from 2015 to 2030 the the sequel as it were to the MDGs I think you're talking you talking in (01:20) terms of sort of massive endless Netflix series so as it were think of the sustainable development goals as the game of Thrones there are some there are some there are some baddies who will you know get elected and then over the time people who you don't think are gonna be very powerful and strong will grow to huge strength and take on power and new alliances will be forged I mean it's a decade of delivery that we're now looking for it's 11 years so I think it's not one line it's like every (02:00) person in a room like this thinking well where does my particular power lie outside just the work that I do in order to try and sort of change up the world then a very interesting fact the other day that just about the importance of a sort of interrelationship between business and and the goals that someone said to me that if temperature were to rise by 4% the insurance industry would cease existing there could be no more insurance because they're all insurance companies would go bankrupt with the extent that they had to pay back things (02:38) so the interrelationship between climate and business and sustainability is so crucial Interviewer: well the idea behind the goals are so brilliant right it's it's hey let's do this together let's set our ambition our strategy our objectives as a global human family and they're ambitious around poverty and climate change and health but they can also feel overwhelming and challenging and a bit hopeless sometimes so how do you stay optimistic as you as you're thinking about rallying the world rallying all of (03:14) us to take on these these goals Richard Curtis: well I don't I mean I don't know how much all of you know about the goals they were negotiated in after a loan negotiation by a hundred and ninety three countries there are seventeen of them I think they break down into 169 targets and the idea behind them was to be comprehensive you know I think that one of the things that is sometimes hard for all of us is you say well I'm gonna really commit to this issue you know I'm gonna support Amnesty International or I'm going to worry (03:47) about plastic in the oceans and everything you think well while I'm committing to that one should I be committing to other things and to you know is is am I in conflict with people who believe those when we did the Make Poverty History campaign which led to Live Aid there was an extraordinary moment when climate stormed out of the room I remember he was wearing shorts and carrying a bicycle and we just decided it was too complicated a mixture of things to deal with and the point about these goals is they really do say (04:20) that everything is interdependent and that actually extreme poverty is a massive Vishu in terms of climate and that injustice will also lead to extreme poverty so that all of those things are tied together so I think the idea really is that it does give it's really useful to have a big plan I mean all of you run companies you have a very very complex agenda towards absolutely everything that you do you're used to complexity and the idea that you could solve the problems of the world by sort of three simple nice phrases would be ridiculous (04:54) so the goals do actually give you an opportunity to put everything next to everything so that you actually can align the policies of a government or the policies of a business next to it and see really how you're doing and I think that makes us feel very safe and very you know United Interviewer: but do you ever do you ever feel that the challenges are just you know too far away and that we're not making the kind of progress that we should as a globe or do you see hope and some of the indicators that we're seeing at this point where we're (05:28) going Richard Curtis: yeah I'm naturally an optimist and I mean there are clearly a lot of very dark things in the world but that that speech you just saw President Obama say you know he said if there was one moment in the history of the world in which you would be best to be born that moment is now I saw an astonishing graphic of mortality in African countries between 1950 and 1920 20 the other day which was you know all in lines and they just went to just getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and you do see (06:12) extraordinary I mean you just have to look out for things to be optimistic about when I write my romantic films I'm sometimes accused of being sentimental and and untrue and I don't understand that at all so if someone someone makes a film about a serial killer they've only ever been four of them and it's called a you know searingly realistic portrait the problems facing modern society and I write a film about love and probably at least 60% of you are in love with someone at the moment and there are 7 (06:50) million people in love in London then for some reason it's called sentimental and unrealistic and untrue and I think that it just depends which way you know which way you look and my experience when I started comic relief you know I was depending on comedians many of the least nice people in the world and certainly were those selfish and I was saying to them will you do what you can for charity and we've raised whatever it is 1. (07:20) 3 billion and and and the what's happening in terms of diseases is extraordinary and I remember I wrote a film about malaria and I had a very angry phone call from the director of it saying and it took a while to make an effort and he said you haven't even checked your facts he said you know there's only 250,000 children died of malaria this year not as I had in the script five hundred thousand and it was because in the four years since I'd originally written it the number had gone down so dramatically I said to you by the way this is good news I said no (07:53) if I'm about 5 million accurate writing that's good news but I do look around me and I think that I mean you must all feel that there is power and technology to do bad but astonishing power and technology to do good there's you know terrible worries about climate change but an astonishingly empowered younger generation that has suddenly started to get the message it tremendous questions of you know inequality in terms but you know particularly of men and women but you know we are also the me two (08:28) generation things ignite things change so I think you have to sign off and say you know cynics knows days never made any money yet not a single dollar and I think that if you're optimistic and if you view the things that are working and I think then the goals provides a plan for that there is no reason not to think that you can't change the world magnificently Interviewer: well you have been obviously so successful in getting your films out globally people know and love them everywhere as you think about this part of your life where you're trying to get (09:04) the world the globe to know about and think about and care about the global close how do you think you know what's the best way to do that how do you inspire people to to be involved and reach people Richard Curtis: well I mean I've taken rather a sort of when you make films the people you hate most of the people you make the posters from the trailers particularly the posters and ghastly retouched photograph poster makers probably probably not even with your stars actual bottom probably somebody else's bottom of the photograph and then (09:43) and then you know a line you didn't write so this whole thing that you've made that you've put so much effort into well I'm the poster guy for the goals I'm trying to make them we came up with this graphic we're trying to make them simple we argued about you know trying to keep the names of them short and I'm just trying to get the word out there because what you want is that when people you know go to their employees and say let's do something about the goals you want them to have just glimpse (10:12) them come across them in some way when you make a film there's a big tradition now of you know trying to sort of get some shot of the making of the film into the newspapers so that when people see the poster it's the second time they've heard about it and when they see the trailer it's the third time and then they may be tempted to go to see the film so what we're trying to do is to spread the word in as many ways as we can through pop music through concerts through graphics through this thing we (10:41) could do called the world's largest lessons through partnership through businesses you know to try and get the idea of them out there so that when people actually you know in companies and in politics focus on them they believe that it's something that the public will endorse and possibly feel passionate about Interviewer: And one of the things that we've chatted about backstage is just you know the role of Technology so how are you seeing technology advancing and being able to help us to get get to these goals Richard Curtis: I think you probably I mean I (11:17) think that you know there's an enormous amount that technology can do I mean well I'm really you know you do look for technology just have some of the you know actual answers but certainly we have never been in a world where there's more possibility for a message going virally and hugely and then once you get that message as it were being able to press on the button of each of these and see what are the things that you can do because by the way I'm a huge believer that we can do things individually in (11:51) our lives and I think that is a very good way of as it were starting with meatless Monday and giving Tuesday and change your pension scheme Wednesday and what but no but tell me Jacqueline what's your sense about what Google could do and what technology can do for the goals because that's the world in which as it were my kids are living and most people are referring to that for their information in their… Interviewer: well you know I think like you were saying we've we've seen great progress and in some ways you know we've we've have (12:26) child poverty and great advances in health but the rest of the gap is really gonna take new solutions and I think that's where technology especially AI can be really helpful we just you know at Google we've been trying to think about how can we inspire the world especially young technologists people who are researching nonprofits social businesses to align their work with with the global goals and so one of the things that we did is we we actually launched a competition this last year an open call where we put out 25 million (13:00) dollars in a pool of funding and then expertise from our AI professionals and then said okay right tell us your idea align it with the global goals tell us how you're going to use AI and the winners which we just you know they're doing incredible work for example a team in Africa in Uganda is using really low-cost sensors that they're putting on the backs of motorcycle taxis and they're using that to map and track air pollution which is one of the silent killers and then using that to measure what's being effective (13:35) in fighting that air pollution a team in India for example is using AI to help diagnose what the the pests and the diseases are that subsistence farmers are facing and then put the right pesticide against that and that's gonna help not only the farmers to earn more income but it's going to help reduce pesticide use which is gonna help the environment that's also frontiere was one of our winners here in europe and they're doing amazing work on antibiotic resistance so they have a smartphone app (14:04) that an untrained community worker in the field could use in a low resource environment to read whether the bacteria that someone has is resistant that way they're gonna do better health for the individual but they're also going to help the globe with this kind of resistance so there's all sorts of ideas many of them being led out at the global South on how we can apply AI so we we are just trying to think about how can we seed and support inspire those kinds of technologies so we also published (14:38) some research on our site you know a lot of people think AI is just sort of magic pixie dust and don'tyou know they know it's super powerful and has so many opportunities but don't know exactly how that could apply to their cause the issue that they care about so we published some research on our site a eyes for social impact people and you can see there how what are all the AI technologies that are showing the most promise for each of the global goals so I think this kind of building the ecosystem and and building up partners (15:09) who are working on this issue is is the way that we're gonna get technology to help us accelerate and close that gap Richard Curtis: well that’s so exciting to me I do think that this idea that we may have a generation now and I hope it applies to everyone here that thinks what is my work for if it's not for tried to make the world better I believe that they be making this up Paul Palmer told me that they they did two ads for the same job at Unilever and they tested one which stressed what Unilever does for the world and it's sort of sustainable commitments and (15:48) the other one that stretched the perks and the wages and many many more people applied through the ad on the sustainability and what they do and I think the idea that you can point a generation in the direction of thinking that it's a both/and you don't need to say well I'm either gonna make a lot of money and sell my patent for millions or I'm gonna change the world you can make yes okay yes it changes the world and then you can also make a lot of money Interviewer: Well I think you're right that many (16:18) people are motivated and many people just want to know what can I do so what would you say Richard to this audience if they want to get behind the global goals and help with the work that you're doing Richard Curtis: Well I mean I think there there is an enormous number of things that you can do one just in your own lives as I was saying think about the things which could make a difference I'm really finding that helpful I will now buy an electric car because I just think that it's important to know that in the (16:48) texture of your own lives you're actually doing the things that you're meant to do because that's what you know and then inspires you textually I think that it is really it would be brilliant to communicate something about the goals to your employees because I do think this is a sort of bounce thing the moment that you say to the people who work for you we're interested in these things have a look at them check them out yourselves and then as it were counter check with us I think that you will find an amazingly interesting (17:21) dialogue between you on all the areas of your behavior on your supply chains on you know gender equality on how you're affecting the environment I think that would be an amazingly helpful dialogue check your pension fund I think this is a really interesting idea you know someone said to me the other day they're like a third of the world's money's owned by governments a third of it's owned by rich people and a third of it's owned by us as it were you know we the way that we're gonna get (17:50) more investment in all the extraordinary projects like the ones that you're describing is by pension funds and investment investing increasingly and sustainability and an impact and in those things that will change the world and I would love the feeling that when you start to talk to your employees they will say well how's our pension fund invested where's our money going and that will increasingly go into all the best projects that they can do and that some of those projects will of course be things that you yourselves are working (18:20) on now so I think it's just to introduce it into the environment of the place that you work and then really check out whether or not the things that you do are in accordance with it it'll be helpful if it hadn't been for the ten commandments I would have been committing adultery and murdering people every day of the week but I was definitely so so I just think that it's a really useful purpose and plan and if you don't know them this is the time by the way because in 2005 when we did the (18:57) Make Poverty History campaign Live Aid I couldn't the meetings with people in business were so ghastly they really just thought this is a bunch of dangerous lefties who want to give away all their money and now business as you know as there were you talking about the things that you're backing they're actually ahead they're the ones you've seen that there's a whatever business from betterworld said twelve trillion advantage in actually working for an investing of the goals people can (19:26) see that that's the way that business should go so this is exactly the moment and if we can create a dialogue between business and government because governments much prefer talking to businesses than they do talking to charities they hate charity people they always just go on repeating themselves but if you can start a dialogue 2020 is the moment to kind of start the second phase of the and so anything that any of you can do and what to have a conversation without some project everyone you know would be (19:55) dreaming.” Video: Richard Curtis | Wiki4All – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5gMq1nmjBE

Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023 where are see well that we're getting free tickets putting you on is that (04:03) right where are you where are you next where are you next I'm well I'm going to be I'm going to be in leads on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.” Video: Richard Curtis and His Start with Four Weddings and a Funeral - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YutcjLfHVRI Transcript: (00:04) Interviewer: the film that we first got to know you with As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum MH that that smatter is an exact proportional representation um of how much money that movie made in comparison to Four Weddings Interviewer: okay so “four weddings and a funeral” um introdu gave us Hugh Grant in America that's sort of what all sold us on Hugh Grant um would you like to apologize to anyone right now Richard Curtis: (00:39) the answer the official answer is only to Divine Brown isn't it that's the that's the official answer to the question but no no I mean I didn't I tried not to allow Hugh to audition because I thought he was too handsome and I thought it would… Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis on film’s legacy - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNspva0W3xY Transcript: Interviewer: (00:00) 20 years Richard Curtis: yeah I know I think the 20 years shows what a youthful optimist I probably was when I wrote it Interviewer: he says he still wants to write about our Humanity the surprising ways we are good to each other in a world that has so many movies filled with trauma and violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do think the way to think about life is that every day has the potential in all its Simplicity just to be just to be gorgeous.” Video: (1) Richard Curtis explains why he likes to set his films in Britain - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvBZnc_Wbg Transcript: (00:03) and I wrote the script and it was set in Boston and I went to see the people at MGM and they said this is amazing this is a fantastic script I said oh I'm so thrilled and they said except the two leading characters we don't like I said why and they said well it's sort of weak no one's gonna admire them we'll want to spend time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of the jokes don't work because people won't get their humor so I said that only needs the title that's the only thing we've got and they said we hate the time and I I flew home two weeks later and I swore I'll never do a film that's not set actually where I live. Video: Richard Curtis Fellowship tribute - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dWYjDuaRBg Transcript: (00:17) Person 1: Richard Curtis is the most splendid bandy utter knob head i've ever met Person 2: I congratulate BAFTA on giving Richard Curtis this award I can't think of anyone who deserves it more if if only because he makes the world a better place to be Person 3: and I think Richard Curtis is the greatest living Briton who happens to be from New Zealand Person 4: five words to describe Richard Curtis: funny, saintly, didn't write Angels. Person 5: all his work is as seamless thing that the Vicar of Dibley and Blackadder and Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a (01:00) funeral and comic relief and Love Actually and Make Poverty History are all part of who he is as a man and also as this incredibly talented writer and creative artist Person 6: well he's an enigma and rather like the character of Charles and Four Weddings when I was sent that script I never really understood the character because I thought no one in England is both funny and nice you know you can't or not the sort of a servic and nice but Richard does bring off that strange balancing act Person 7: no I think what he he's a master of is the apparent (01:35) inability of people to communicate certainly that was true of the character I played in Love Actually and I think it's very true of the character that Hugh Grant plays in Notting Hill Person 1: Richard’s funniest lines are undoubtedly Hugh Grant's lines which are always ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” Person 7: what's actually happening is that he's expressing something very very precisely in this apparent breakdown of language in this district Person 1: ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” I love those Person 2: the trademarks I suppose of a Richard Curtis script apart from the fact that it will always be intelligent clever and (02:28) purposeful is the fact that every minute and a half or so he'll deliver a world-class joke Person 5: the thing that marks our Richards work from it everyone else's is that it's a seamless part of who he is as a person and so that he didn't write Love Actually in order to make a crowd-pleasing film he wrote it because that's his philosophy of life Person 6: basically yeah I'm afraid to say he actually does quite like people you know he's the exact that's what makes it makes me laugh that I play these (03:00) characters which are basically him in his films because he is basically nice and full of benevolence and I am basically nasty and full of hatred Person 7: if one is right in thinking that Richards view of the world is very focused on love as a force in common with all humanity and love and all its difficulties in that it's the thing that somehow drives us all which is the thesis of Love Actually I think that does lie at the root of his work for Africa Person 8: I mean we all saw the Michael Burke films from that came out of (03:35) Ethiopia but instigated live oh but we should actually went on his own money to go and look and to see what he could do to help Person 9: he invented Red Nose Day I mean it's not given to many people who invent a day there's a man Jesus I'm not sure how many others I can name Person 3: the Red Nosed they affect is extraordinary the level of knowledge about issues around poverty is so high in Britain compared to the rest of Europe or America Person 8: is immensely generous with his time you know when it's a comic relief here he'll give up (04:05) six months of his life sometimes twelve eighteen months to make sure something will happen properly Person 4: couple of years before the Gleneagles g8 summit we were in desperate need of the best storyteller we could find to communicate these rather dull issues of debt and trade to the British public so he asked Richard to take a year off and make poverty history Person 7: looking back at the Live 8 (concerts) I think it's quite remarkable that his efforts together with Bob Geldof got people talking in a way that had never happened before never would (04:39) have been possible Person 2: “The Girl In the Café” was a great opportunity for me and it was something that I'm extremely proud to have been associated with it's a perfect amount of of entertainment and information and it made a big impact all over the world particularly in America where it was extremely well received Person 3: his work with Comic Relief and Make Poverty History is responsible for saving the lives literally countless mothers daughters fathers and sons across the world Person 7: when looking at what he's achieved I think (05:14) it's very very important to remember that he is also very largely responsible for Hugh Grant and I think that has to be taken into consideration when looking at the good side of Richard Person 4: Richard congratulations mate you're an absolute national treasure Person 1: I think it's very important that Richard Curtis should own this fellowship because otherwise how will he return the ring to Mordor Video: Richard Curtis, What's Funny? | MontclairFilm – YouTube https://youtu.be/-UqyVPGVM_8?list=LL Transcript: Interviewer: I understand, and tell me if I got this right, is that when you first started writing a wrote for the BBC, and that you were given a list of things that were funny. Richard Curtis: Yes, that's absolutely right, yeah. Interviewer: Okay, that's a difference between American comedy and British comedy. No one gives us a list of things that were funny when we started writing job. What was this list? The government had officially determined. Richard Curtis: No. I didn't like that list, but they were, and they were in a funny way, summed up by Cambridge, an Oxford when I was there. Cambridge had a real sort of system. You've probably heard of the Cambridge Footlights, and you kind of auditioned for it. They had a show up in Edinburgh. So they'd almost sort of math and math-ish-sized comedy. Time you saw a sketch of theirs. You thought, oh, that's very highly wrought and very clever, but there was very little humanity in it. And actually, you see a lot of that in Monty-Python. Not that much humanity. And that had sort of crept into the BBC. And so when you went there, they said, well, we're doing a satirical program, and the funny things are trade unions, British rail sandwiches. You know, the chancellor's eyebrows. And I thought the funny things were someone who's a bit uneasy with the person sending next door to them, because they're taller than they are. Do I mean, everything I thought was funny, was to do with human beings interacting, and nothing to do with politics and preconceptions. So that was the reason I failed failed so badly on weak ending the satirical radiation.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Video: Richard Curtis Talks ABOUT TIME with AMC - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQJK3xXDrc Transcript: Interviewer: (00:05) so now you came up with this premise over a pretty simple conversation right about what you would do with the last 24 hours liv Richard Curtis: yeah actually i i came up with the idea that i wanted to write a film about how to be happy and about appreciating a normal day that actually your happiest day wouldn't be some exotic day in las vegas with winning a million dollars and hearing you'd be nominated for an oscar that'd be tense and nervous but uh the idea my first idea was in fact to write a really simple film about (00:35) a normal day and then i thought that'll be dull so i then thought i'll write a huge science fiction time travel movie where the person finally decides that all he would do with this gift is simply lead a normal day and travel back to the beginning of each day and just live it again and enjoy it Interviewer: and i felt like you really wrote that in bill nye's character out of all of them because you know even with this gift it kind of goes back to that simplicity of just the beauty of our everyday life Richard Curtis: right yeah that's so true and bill and I (01:06) talk about this a lot now i mean i think we're we're both saying to each other are you sticking to the moral of the movie we're trying to make sure we're holding to it because both of us feel as though we should you know be more happy just with the normal day and not worry so much Interviewer: so what i love so much about your films is that all these characters they're witty and intelligent but very very relatable i feel like we can all relate to at least one of them and the same goes with gleason and mcadams characters (01:35) their chemistry on screen was amazing what was it like watching you know these characters come alive in the two of them again with chemistry that can't be taught it's there or it's not Richard Curtis: no it's so interesting i'm not i i until my films are well cast they're no good at all it would you would be interested how in the casting sessions i just lose confidence with every single person who comes in and it's only when you actually get the perfect person like as there were love in life suddenly when donald came in for the (02:04) first time the part was funny and i think that you tend to cast people who kind of appeal to your heart and then once you've done that they are likely to have some chemistry they are likely to get on with each other you know i could tell that both donal and rachel were basically sweet people with a naughty twinkle and i think that's why they got on so well Interviewer: i like that naughty twinkle so out of all the amazing characters that you have created and there are so many of them who do you think from a past film would (02:35) have been a good addition in this film Richard Curtis: oh what an interesting question um i don't know if you i mean that's an interesting question because spike you remember who Hugh lived with in notting hill if you see course very bad he wouldn't have fitted into this movie at all but there was a character in “four weddings” a very sweet character played by james fleet who was the not very clever posh rich friend yeah i can imagine him fitting into this movie and then Bill's character in love actually could just have been on the (03:06) telly because i think it's ten years since the movie came out and i'm sure he would be re-releasing the movie the dodgy song for christmas to try and make a few extra Interview: i think you should throw him in every movie that character the rock star Richard Curtis: on the radio Interviewer: yes so why do you think amc theater audiences and audiences everywhere are going to love this movie Richard Curtis: i hope that they will get slightly more than they bargained for i mean i it is quite a romantic film but i hope there are lots of jokes in it there actually (03:34) is some time travel and some of the normal chaos that time travel chooses and then i think in the end the movie turns out to be a little bit more emotional than expected i've known a lot of people who say that the moment they walked out they rang their dad or ran their son so i hope it'll be a movie that actually leaves something in your mind when you've seen. Video: Richard Curtis Interview: Love, Actually, Genie, Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio | Collider Interviews – YouTube https://youtu.be/8DSE5a0Xvyc Transcript: When I spoke to you for yesterday, you told me you had a five-hour cut of Pirate Radio. My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Macaron I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, welcome to the BAFTA and BFI International Screenwriters lecture series for 2013. I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day. Video: Richard Curtis Reveals What Happens To LOVE ACTUALLY Characters 20 Years Later | INTERVIEW | Jake’s Takes – YouTube https://youtu.be/rssrnQXOc8o Transcript: \\"The story that I loved two decades ago \\"is different than the story I love now as an adult.\\" So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys. Video: Richard Curtis: Christmas Forces My Family To Come Home 🎄| Virgin Radio UK -YouTube https://youtu.be/pxpp0C7wIPA Transcript: So this is in London on the 7th to the 11th of December. It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show. Sounds like the new football football when everybody scores later goals. Var. Exactly. Var should appear. Right. Right. Let me do this properly. So, Christmas actually, the South Bank centres are all festival in London. A seventh till the 11th of December, Royal Festival Hall. Yeah. Yeah. South Bank Centre dot code of T.K. Book for that now. Genie is on Sky Cinema from the first of December. And four funerals and a wedding is going to happen. We were in the conversation. So technically we are contributors. So change your word, take a third or kind of stuff. Yeah. You'll be hearing from our people. And I could see you playing a priest. Tang what? A priest. A priest? No, a priest. I can see you. I can see you in the cameo. We've always planned. Cameo? Yeah. Cameo? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right then. Bye. --- 1. A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?!

Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’. Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 3. What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting).

What insights do they have to the screenwriting process? Curtis's insights into the screenwriting process highlight the importance of authenticity, personal connection to the material, and the power of collaboration. He values storytelling that resonates with audiences on an emotional level while incorporating elements of humor and wit.

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding. Cormier R (2016) 15 Splendid Facts About Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mental Floss website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73509/15-splendid-facts-about-four-weddings-and-funeral Thompson A (1994) ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'' a surprise hit, Entertainment Weekly website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://ew.com/article/1994/05/06/four-weddings-and-funeral-surprise-hit/ Richard Whalley Anthony Curtis, CBE (born 8 November 1956) is New Zealand-born British screenwriter, music producer, actor and film director, known primarily for romantic comedy films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, Notting Hill, and Love Actually, as well as the hit sitcoms Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.”","output":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts.
