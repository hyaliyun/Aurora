Note that the empty set has sum 0. Show that if a set ( S ) is comprehensive, then there is some (not necessarily proper) subset of ( S ) with at most ( n1 ) elements which is also comprehensive.","output":"We need to show that if ( S ) is a comprehensive set, then there exists a subset of ( S ) with at most ( n-1 ) elements that is also comprehensive. 1. **Initial Setup:**    Consider ( S = {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_k} ) where ( k geq n ). Since ( S ) is comprehensive, by definition, for every integer ( 0 leq x < n ), there is a subset of ( S ) whose sum has remainder ( x ) when divided by ( n ). 2. **Process and Tracking Remainders:**    We start with the empty set, which has a sum of 0 and thus, the set of remainders, ( T ), initially is ( {0} ). As we add each element ( s_i ) from ( S ), we update the set of remainders. 3. **Updating Remainders:**    For each element ( s_i ) added, the set of possible remainders becomes:    [    T cup {(t + s_i) mod n mid t in T}    ]    This means the new remainders include all previous remainders, plus the sum of each previous remainder plus ( s_i ), taken modulo ( n ). 4. **Final Remainders Set:**    At the beginning of the process, we have:    [    T_1 = {0}    ]    After adding elements one by one, since ( S ) is comprehensive, the final set of remainders must be:    [    {0, 1, ldots, n-1}    ] 5. **Element Contribution and Bin Size Constraint:**    Since ( |S| = k geq n ), we add in at least ( n ) elements. During this process, because ( |{0, 1, ldots, n-1}| = n ), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one element ( s_i ) in ( S ) whose addition does not introduce any new remainders. 6. **Removing Non-Contributing Element:**    Let's denote the comprehensive set of remainders before adding ( s_i ) by ( T ). If adding ( s_i ) does not change the set of remainders, then:    [    T = T cup {(t + s_i) mod n mid t in T }    ]    implies ( T ) remained unchanged. This indicates that ( S ) remains comprehensive without ( s_i ). 7. **Repeating the Process:**    By iteratively removing such non-contributing elements ( s_i ), we reduce the set size while maintaining its comprehensive property. We repeat this process until we've reduced the set to have at most ( n-1 ) elements. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have shown that from any comprehensive set ( S ) of size at least ( n ), it is possible to find a comprehensive subset of ( S ) containing at most ( n-1 ) elements.

The first skyscraper was built 100 years ago. 2. The tallest skyscraper today is 3 times taller than the first one. 3. The future skyscraper will be 25% taller than the current tallest skyscraper. First, we need to determine the height of the future skyscraper in relation to the first one. If the current tallest skyscraper is 3 times taller than the first one, and the future skyscraper is 25% taller than the current tallest, then the future skyscraper will be: 3 (current tallest) * 1.25 (25% taller) = 3.75 times the height of the first skyscraper. Now, we need to determine how long it will take to climb the future skyscraper. If it takes 1 hour to climb the first skyscraper, then climbing a skyscraper that is 3.75 times taller would take: 1 hour (to climb the first skyscraper) * 3.75 = 3.75 hours. However, the question asks when it will take twice the time to climb the first skyscraper's height to reach the top of the future skyscraper. Since it takes 1 hour to climb the first skyscraper, twice that time would be: 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours. Since climbing the future skyscraper takes 3.75 hours, which is already more than twice the time it takes to climb the first skyscraper, we can conclude that the future skyscraper that is 25% taller than the current tallest one will already take more than twice the time to climb the height of the first skyscraper.

We exclude such polyhedrons from our consideration. 2. **Assuming existence**: Suppose there exists a heptahedron ( W ) (a polyhedron with 7 faces) where each face is a quadrilateral. 3. **Evaluating the number of edges**:      - Each face being a quadrilateral means each face has 4 edges.     - Since each edge is shared by two faces, the total number of unique edges is:     [     frac{7 cdot 4}{2} = 14     ] 4. **Vertices calculation**:      - If every vertex in ( W ) connects exactly three edges, then the total number of edge-vertex incidences is 3 times the number of vertices.      - Since there are 14 edges and each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint), we obtain:     [     frac{14 cdot 2}{3} = frac{28}{3} = 9 frac{1}{3}     ]     - This result ( 9 frac{1}{3} ) is not possible because the number of vertices must be an integer. 5. **Conclusion on vertices**: Thus, there must exist at least one vertex ( A ) where more than three edges meet. In fact, at least four edges must meet at vertex ( A ). 6. **Contradiction with quadrilaterals**:     - Let's denote the faces meeting at ( A ) as ( alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3, alpha_4, ldots ).     - If no two of these faces share an edge other than those meeting at ( A ), each face ( alpha_i ) has exactly two edges meeting at ( A ).     - Since each face ( alpha_i ) is a quadrilateral, and each face would need an additional two edges distinct from other quadrilaterals for a total of four edges, it implies:     - ( 4 text{ faces} times 2 text{ non-shared edges} = 8 text{ non-shared edges} ) 7. **Re-evaluation of non-shared edges**:     - But since our heptahedron has a total of 14 edges, the remaining 3 faces must share the 8 non-shared edges, contradicting the earlier claim since the remaining number of edges (14 - 8 = 6) should be enough to complete the structure of those 3 faces, which isn't possible.  8. **Final contradiction**:      - Given every condition and the steps followed, our heptahedron has inconsistencies in defining the relationships between vertices, edges, and faces leading to a logical contradiction.

This function is known to be concave, as its second derivative,        f''(x) = -frac{1}{x^2} leq 0,          indicates concavity by always being non-positive for ( x > 0 ). 2. **Apply Jensen's Inequality**:    Because ( f(x) = ln x ) is concave, Jensen's Inequality can be applied. For concave functions, Jensen's Inequality states that for any positive weights ( alpha_i ) with ( sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i = 1 ) and any positive numbers ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ), the following holds:        fleft( sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i x_i right) geq sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i f(x_i).     3. **Specify the Weights**:    Set the weights as ( alpha_i = frac{1}{n} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ).

Here, (v(n)) is the number of times 2 divides (n!), which is given by the function (nu_2(n!)). 2. **Expressing (v(n)):**    The order of 2 in (n!) is given by:    [    v(n) = nu_2(n!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^k} rightrfloor    ]    This sum counts the number of factors of 2 in the numbers from 1 to (n). 3. **Modulo Property:**    We need to show that for any (a) and (m), there exists (n > 1) such that:    [    v(n) equiv a pmod{m}    ] 4. **Behavior of (v(n)):**    Notice that (v(n)) is a non-decreasing function as (n) increases. Also, (v(n)) increases by 1 whenever (n) is a power of 2. This means (v(n)) can take on a wide range of values as (n) increases. 5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**    Since (v(n)) is non-decreasing and increases without bound as (n) increases, for any modulus (m), the values of (v(n) pmod{m}) will eventually cover all possible residues (0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1). This is because there are infinitely many (n) and only (m) possible residues modulo (m). 6. **Existence of (n):**    Therefore, for any given (a) and (m), there must exist some (n) such that:    [    v(n) equiv a pmod{m}    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    By the pigeonhole principle and the unbounded nature of (v(n)), we can conclude that such an (n) always exists.

Since f(1) = -k > 0, and f(e^k) = k - ke^k = k(1 - e^k) < 0, we have f(1) cdot f(e^k) < 0, so the function f(x) has a unique zero in the interval (0, +infty).

This implies ln x_1 - ln x_2 = k(x_1 - x_2) and ln x_1 + ln x_2 = k(x_1 + x_2). Since x_1 x_2 > e^2, we have ln x_1 + ln x_2 > 2, and hence k(x_1 + x_2) > 2. This gives frac{ln x_1 - ln x_2}{x_1 - x_2} > frac{2}{x_1 + x_2}, or ln frac{x_1}{x_2} > frac{2(x_1 - x_2)}{x_1 + x_2}.

This probability is the square of the probability of drawing a blue gumball once, because the events are independent and she replaced the gumball each time. Let's denote the probability of drawing a blue gumball as P(blue). Then the probability of drawing two blue gumballs in a row would be P(blue) * P(blue), or (P(blue))^2.

In parallelogram EFGH, diagonals bisect each other, so the point L, being the intersection of diagonals and line segment JK, divides each in a particular ratio which depends on the position of points J and K.  1. Since point J divides side EF in the ratio 1:3, segment EJ:JF = 1:3; hence JF = 4a - a = 3a. 2. Point K dividing side EH in the ratio 1:2, segment EK:KH = 1:2; hence KH = 3b - b = 2b. 3. The line JK cuts the diagonal EG at L, maintaining the ratio of division of both JF and KH in such a way that the ratio is translated onto EG. This can be determined as follows:    Assume x = frac{EG}{EL}. By the section formula (internal division) applied to both lines, you apply the weights to L placed on diagonal EG:     x = frac{EJ + EK}{EL} times frac{3a + 2b}{b}.    By symmetry in a parallelogram and equal partitioning of diagonals:     EG = 2(3a + 2b) = 6a + 4b.

We know that when this number is multiplied by 5 repeatedly k times, none of the resulting numbers contain the digit 7 in their decimal representation. The sequence of numbers generated by multiplying by 5 is:    [    n, 5n, 5^2 n, 5^3 n, ldots, 5^k n    ] 2. **Formulate Our Target Sequence:**    To prove the existence of a natural number that can be multiplied by 2 repeatedly k times, without any of the resulting numbers containing the digit 7, we can start from a known sequence that fits such a property for multiplication by 5.        Consider 5^k n as a candidate and multiply it by 2 repeatedly:        [    5^k n, quad 2 cdot 5^k n, quad 2^2 cdot 5^k n, quad ldots, quad 2^k cdot 5^k n    ] 3. **Examine the Properties of the Numbers:**    Observe that each number in the above sequence can be rewritten by considering its structure relative to powers of 10:    [    2^i cdot 5^k n quad text{for} quad i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, k    ]    Ensure that the products 2^i cdot 5^k n retain the no-sevens property. 4. **Analyze Decimal Representation:**    For each i, the term 2^i cdot 5^k n can be rewritten as (2^i cdot 5^{k-i}) cdot (10^{i} n). This transformation highlights that the numbers differ from those in the sequence 5^k n, 5^{k-1} n, ldots, n by only the addition of trailing zeros caused by multiplying powers of 10.    Thus, the numbers have the form where the only change involves the addition of zeros at the end of the decimal representation:        [    5^{k-i} cdot 10^{i} n    ] 5. **Conclusion Based on the Representation:**    Given our initial condition for n (which generates no digit 7 for the sequence of multiplications by 5), it follows that each term in the form 5^{k-i} cdot 10^i n will not introduce a 7 in the sequence through the extra zeros. Since none of these terms will result in a digit 7 appearing, it is concluded that there exists a natural number that satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem when multiplying by 2 repeatedly.

So, we can set up the equation: 250 miles (first car) + 5S miles (second car) = 450 miles Now, we solve for \\"S\\": 5S = 450 miles - 250 miles 5S = 200 miles S = 200 miles / 5 S = 40 mph Therefore, the speed of the second car is boxed{40}  mph."},{"instruction":"Let proposition p: Sequence {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence, proposition q: Sequences {a_{2k1}} and {a_{2k}} (kin N^{*}) are both geometric sequences.

This means there exists a common ratio r such that for any n in mathbb{N}^*, we have frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r. 2. **Implication of p on q**: Since {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence with common ratio r, we can express this as:    - For the subsequence {a_{2k}}, we have frac{a_{2k+2}}{a_{2k}} = r^2.    - Similarly, for the subsequence {a_{2k-1}}, we have frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k-1}} = r^2.        This shows that both {a_{2k-1}} and {a_{2k}} are geometric sequences with common ratio r^2, proving that if p is true, then q is also true. Therefore, p is a sufficient condition for q. 3. **Counterexample for necessity**: Consider the sequence {1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,ldots}. In this sequence:    - The subsequence {a_{2k-1}} = {1,2,4,8,ldots} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2.    - The subsequence {a_{2k}} = {1,3,9,27,ldots} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 3.        However, the original sequence {a_{n}} is not a geometric sequence. This demonstrates that q can be true without p being true, showing that p is not a necessary condition for q. Given the analysis above, we conclude that proposition p (Sequence {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence) is a sufficient but not necessary condition for proposition q (Sequences {a_{2k-1}} and {a_{2k}} (kin mathbb{N}^{*}) are both geometric sequences).

We claim that the maximum possible sum is ( frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} ). We will prove this by induction. 1. **Base Case: ( n = 2 )**    - Let the two numbers be ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) with ( a_1 < a_2 ).    - The only pairwise sum is ( a_1 + a_2 ).    - Since ( a_1 < a_1 + a_2 ) and ( a_2 < a_1 + a_2 ), we need to check if ( a_1 ) or ( a_2 ) divides ( a_1 + a_2 ).    - Clearly, ( a_1 ) divides ( a_1 + a_2 ) but ( a_2 ) does not divide ( a_1 + a_2 ) because ( a_2 ) is greater than ( a_1 ).    - Therefore, the number written on the board is 1.    - The sum of the numbers written by Ivan is ( 1 ), which matches ( frac{(2-1)2(2+1)}{6} = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n )**    - Suppose the statement holds for ( n ) distinct positive integers.    - Let the numbers be ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{n+1} ).    - By the inductive hypothesis, the sum of the numbers written on the board for the first ( n ) numbers is at most ( frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} ). 3. **Consider the quantities ( a_{n+1} + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n )**    - For each ( i ), ( a_i ) divides at most ( n+1-i ) of these quantities.    - If ( a_i ) divides ( a_{n+1} + a_ell ) and ( a_{n+1} + a_m ) for ( ell, m leq i ), then ( a_i ) also divides ( a_ell - a_m ), which is a contradiction since ( a_ell - a_m < a_i ). 4. **Sum of the numbers written for ( a_{n+1} + a_i )**    - For each ( a_{n+1} + a_i ), a number at most ( n+1-i ) is written on the board.    - This increases the total by at most ( sum_{i=1}^n (n+1-i) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). 5. **Total sum calculation**    - The total sum is at most:      [      frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} + frac{n(n+1)}{2}      ]    - Simplifying this, we get:      [      frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6} + frac{3n(n+1)}{6} = frac{(n-1)n(n+1) + 3n(n+1)}{6} = frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}      ] 6. **Construction for equality**    - Consider the numbers ( 2^1, 2^2, ldots, 2^n ).    - For ( i < j ), ( 2^k ) divides ( 2^i + 2^j ) only for ( k leq i ).    - This makes equality hold in the above proof.

Each subset S(a_{i_j}) can be partitioned into two sets: one containing elements expressible as a_{i_j} + m + nalpha where m + n is even, and the other where m + n is odd. 6. Both subsets S(a_{i_j})_p and S(a_{i_j})_i are good as for any b, c in S(a_{i_j})_p, b - c = (n_b - n_c) + (m_b - m_c)alpha is not 1 or alpha due to m_b - m_c and n_b - n_c being integers. 7.

To find the original price before the discount, we calculate 520 times frac{10}{8} = 650. 3. **Calculating the Total Payment if They Pay Separately:**    - If they pay separately, the total payment is simply the sum of their individual payments, which is 480 + 520 = 1000 yuan. However, this is not the focus of the problem; we are interested in the combined payment scenario. 4. **Calculating the Total Payment if They Pay Together:**    - First Scenario (Considering Xiaohong's purchase as 480):      - The total marked price is 480 (actual price) + 650 = 1130 yuan.      - For the first 800, a 20% discount is applied, so 800 times 0.8 = 640 yuan.      - For the remaining 330 (1130 - 800), a 40% discount is applied, so 330 times 0.6 = 198 yuan.      - Therefore, the total payment is 640 + 198 = 838 yuan.    - Second Scenario (Considering Xiaohong's purchase as potentially 600 for understanding):      - The total marked price is 600 + 650 = 1250 yuan.      - For the first 800, a 20% discount is applied, so 800 times 0.8 = 640 yuan.      - For the remaining 450 (1250 - 800), a 40% discount is applied, so 450 times 0.6 = 270 yuan.      - Therefore, the total payment is 640 + 270 = 910 yuan. Therefore, depending on the scenario considered, if Xiaohong and her mother pay together, they only need to pay a total of boxed{838} yuan or boxed{910} yuan."},{"instruction":"Brendan went fishing with his dad.

We are given that ( u in C^1(overline{D}) ) is a bounded function that is harmonic on ( D ) and ( u = 0 ) on the ( y )-axis. 2. **Consider the subdomain ( D_1 ):**    Define ( D_1 = { (x,y) mid x > 0, y > 0 } ). Since ( u ) is harmonic on ( D ), it is also harmonic on ( D_1 ). Additionally, ( u ) vanishes on the ( y )-axis. 3. **Apply the Schwartz reflection principle:**    By the Schwartz reflection principle for harmonic functions, we can extend ( u ) by reflecting it with the opposite sign over the ( y )-axis. This gives us a harmonic function ( overline{u} ) on the upper half-plane ( { (x,y) mid y > 0 } ) which is bounded. 4. **Define the function ( f ):**    Let ( f(x) = u(x,0) ) for ( x in mathbb{R} ). Since ( u ) is continuous and bounded, ( f ) is a continuous bounded odd function. 5. **Use the Poisson formula:**    By the Poisson formula for harmonic functions over the upper half-plane, we have:    [    overline{u}(x,y) = frac{y}{pi} int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{f(t) , dt}{(t-x)^2 + y^2}, quad forall x,y; , y geq 0.    ] 6. **Extend to the lower half-plane:**    Similarly, we can extend ( u ) to the lower half-plane, giving us ( u(x,y) = u(x,-y) ). Since ( u in C^1(overline{D}) ), we have ( frac{partial u}{partial y}(x,0) = 0 ). 7. **Evaluate the integral:**    Applying the condition ( frac{partial u}{partial y}(x,0) = 0 ) to the Poisson formula, we get:    [    int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{f(t) , dt}{(t-x)^2} = 0.    ]    This implies that ( f(x) = overline{u}(x,0) = 0 ) for all ( x ). 8. **Conclude that ( u ) is identically zero:**    Since ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ), it follows that ( overline{u} equiv 0 ).

Prove that at least three of these nine lines pass through a single point.","output":"1. **Initial Consideration**:      Let us consider each of the 9 lines that divides the square into two quadrilaterals such that their areas are in the ratio 2:3. If a line intersects two adjacent sides of the square, it will create a triangle and a pentagon. However, according to the problem, each line divides the square into two quadrilaterals. 2. **Lines and Their Intersection**:     Therefore, each line must intersect two opposite sides of the square and hence divides the square into two trapezoids (or rectangles). This ensures that the line indeed divides the square into two quadrilaterals with the required area ratio and the bases of the trapezoids are along the opposite sides of the square with heights equal to the side of the square. 3. **Division of the Square**:     Note that a line dividing the square into areas in the ratio 2:3 must thus pass through the midline of the square. Specifically, it divides this midline in the 2:3 ratio. 4. **Identification of Division Points**:     Along the midline of the square, there must be two points where this 2:3 ratio occurs, specifically at frac{2}{5} and frac{3}{5} of the length of the midline from either end. Now consider all such lines for the other pair of opposite sides of the square as well. 5. **Intersection Points**:      When we consider the lines from all sides of the square, four points of intersection will emerge on these division points along the midlines. Thus, there will be total four points of intersection, each occurring at these 2:3 ratio points on each midline side pair intersection. 6. **Conclusion Based on Pigeonhole Principle**:      Each line of the 9 lines must pass through one of these 4 intersection points, known since only these points maintain the required division properties. According to the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these points must be passed through by at least lceil frac{9}{4} rceil = 3 lines due to only having 4 points for placement. Hence, we have demonstrated that there must be at least three lines intersecting at some point within these four critical points due to the nature of the midline and given area ratios.

Thus, we consider a = 1 to a = 9 (two-digit numbers): [ n = 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95.] The sum of these numbers: [ 15 + 25 + 35 + 45 + 55 + 65 + 75 + 85 + 95 = boxed{495}.]"},{"instruction":"A collection of six positive integers has a mean of 5, a unique mode of 4, and a median of 5.

The unique mode is 4, and the median is 5. To meet these conditions, and considering the number 4 must appear more than any other number and at least twice since it's a unique mode, the composition could include numbers like (4, 4) (mode) and (5) (median position). As the current sum of {4, 4, 5, dots} is (4 + 4 + 5 = 13), the sum of the remaining three numbers must be (30 - 13 = 17). To keep 5 as a median, the next smallest number could be another 5, making the sum (13 + 5 = 18), leaving (30 - 18 = 12) for the remaining two numbers. Let’s choose (6, 6) considering we cannot have more 4s due to uniqueness of the mode, and all numbers should be greater than or equal to 4, ensuring 5 remains the median. The collection before adding 9 is ({4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6}). After adding 9, the collection becomes ({4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 9}). The new median is now the fourth number in this ordered set, which is (5).

Summing over all possible k from 0 to m, we get:  sum_{k=0}^{m} binom{m}{k} binom{t+k}{m}  This is the expression on the left-hand side of the given identity.  Method II. Counting the RHS: 1. Choose k 1's from the bottom row and place them in the first t columns. This can be done in binom{t}{k} ways. 2. The remaining m - k 1's in the bottom row will go into the last m columns. This can be done in binom{m}{m-k} = binom{m}{k} ways. 3. The rest of the positions in the bottom row are filled with 0's, and thus the remaining k positions in the top row must be filled, each either with a 0 or a 1. Each of these positions can have 2 choices (0 or 1), so there are 2^k ways to fill these positions. 4. Summing over all possible k from 0 to m, we get:  sum_{k=0}^{m} binom{m}{k} binom{t}{k} cdot 2^{k}  This is the expression on the right-hand side of the given identity. Both methods represent counting the same number of configurations using different approaches. Therefore, we have proven that:  sum_{k=0}^{m} binom{m}{k} binom{t+k}{m} = sum_{k=0}^{m} binom{m}{k} binom{t}{k} cdot 2^{k}  (boxed{})"},{"instruction":"A merchant considers a textdollar{12000} order and has a choice between two sets of successive discounts: 25%, 15%, and 10%, or 30%, 10%, and 5%.

Therefore,     [     A_1B_1 parallel AB, quad B_1C_1 parallel BC, quad A_1C_1 parallel AC     ] 3. Analyze the plane intersection with the sphere.     The plane of the triangular face ASB intersects the given sphere in a circle inscribed around the trapezoid AA_1B_1C. Since this inscribed circle is unique, AA_1 must equal BB_1. Similarly, AA_1 = CC_1. Hence, all segments SA, SB, and SC must be equal. 4. Evaluate the height of the pyramid.     Since SA = SB = SC, the apex S is equidistant from the vertices A, B, and C. Thus, the point H, the foot of the perpendicular from S onto the base triangle ABC, serves as the circumcenter of triangle ABC. 5. Establish the triangle's properties with respect to center H.     Considering S as the apex perpendicular to the base, the right triangle CHS yields the relation:     [     CH = SC cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} SC = frac{1}{2} AB     ] 6. Determine AH and BH.     Since H is the circumcenter of the isosceles triangle ABC, where AB = BC = CA, let H be the midpoint of AB. Hence, H is the same distance from A and B:     [     AH = BH = CH = frac{1}{2} AB     ] 7. Confirm the center of the sphere.    Consequently, point H is a midpoint of segment AB which aligns with our requirement for the sphere’s center, concluding that H is indeed the center of the sphere passing through A, B, C, A_1, B_1, and C_1. 8. Compute the height SH.     Finally, the height SH of the pyramid can be determined using the fact SH lies in the right triangle CHS where:     [     CH = 1 quad text{(as radius)}      ]     [     SH = CH tan (angle CHS) = 1 cdot tan 60^circ = sqrt{3}     ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{sqrt{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"A basketball team consists of 18 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Bob, Bill, and Brett, and a set of twins: Tammy and Tommy.

Next, we need to find the general term of {(frac{1}{x}+2x)}^{5}. The general term, denoted as {T}_{k+1}, can be expressed using the binomial theorem: {T}_{k+1}={C}_{5}^{k}(frac{1}{x})^{5-k}⋅(2x)^{k}={2}^{k}{C}_{5}^{k}{x}^{2k-5}. We are interested in the term where the power of x is 3. To find the appropriate value of k, we set the exponent of x equal to 3 and solve for k: 2k-5=3 implies 2k=8 implies k=4. Now, knowing that k=4, we can substitute this value into the expression for the coefficient of the x^3 term, which comes from the a{(frac{1}{x}+2x)}^{5} part of the expansion: {2}^{4}⋅a⋅{C}_{5}^{4}=20. Solving for a, we have: 16⋅a⋅{C}_{5}^{4}=20 implies a=frac{20}{{C}_{5}^{4}⋅16}. Given that {C}_{5}^{4} = 5 (since {C}_{n}^{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} and thus {C}_{5}^{4} = frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5), we substitute this value into the expression: a=frac{20}{5⋅16}=frac{20}{80}=frac{1}{4}. Therefore, the correct value of a is frac{1}{4}, which corresponds to choice B.

Each smaller circle will have a radius frac{1}{2} R since they are said to cover the larger circle. 2. **Geometry Involved**:    The diameter of each smaller circle is equal to the radius of the larger circle R. Hence, each smaller circle intersects the circumference of the larger circle at points that are separated by no more than R.

Combining the solutions from each interval, the solution set of the inequality f(x) < 10 is (-frac{19}{3}, -1). Therefore, the solution set is boxed{(-frac{19}{3}, -1)}.  Part (2): Prove that |a+b| + |a-b| < f(x) for |a| < 3 and |b| < 3. - **Case 1**: If (a+b)(a-b) geq 0, then |a+b| + |a-b| = |a+b+a-b| = 2|a| < 6, because |a| < 3. - **Case 2**: If (a+b)(a-b) < 0, then |a+b| + |a-b| = |a+b-(a-b)| = 2|b| < 6, because |b| < 3. In both cases, we have |a+b| + |a-b| < 6. From part (1), we know that the minimum value of f(x) is f(-5) = 6. Therefore, we conclude that |a+b| + |a-b| < f(x) for any x, which is boxed{text{True}}."},{"instruction":"Compute arccos (cos 3). All functions are in radians.","output":"Let x = arccos (cos 3).

Once we have the combined length, we can subtract the length of the second train to find the length of the first train. The relative speed of the two trains when they are moving towards each other is the sum of their individual speeds. Since the speeds are given in km/h, we need to convert them to m/s by multiplying by ( frac{1000}{3600} ) or ( frac{5}{18} ). Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) in m/s = (42 km/h + 30 km/h) * ( frac{5}{18} ) = (72 km/h) * ( frac{5}{18} ) = 20 m/s Now, we know the time they take to clear each other is 10.999120070394369 seconds.

Thus, when ( n ) is odd, each row and column sum is a multiple of ( n ).  Case 2: ( n ) is a multiple of 4 We need to show that we can arrange the numbers such that the sum of each row and column remains a multiple of ( n ). 1. Suppose ( n = 4k ) for some integer ( k ).

Consider the following ( 2 times 2 ) template repeatedly: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline x & 4k-x  hline 4k-x & x  hline end{array} ]    - This template ensures that the sum of numbers in each row and column of the ( 2 times 2 ) sub-grid is ( 4k ), a multiple of ( n ). 3.

Without the parallel condition, the statement is not universally true.   - Conclusion: Incorrect. - **Statement C: In the same plane, there is only one line perpendicular to a given line passing through a point.**   - By geometric principles, through a given point not on a line, there is exactly one line perpendicular to the given line in a plane. This statement is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry.   - Conclusion: Correct. - **Statement D: The complement of an acute angle may be equal to its supplement.**   - The complement of an angle is defined as what, when added to the angle, equals 90 degrees. The supplement of an angle is what, when added to the angle, equals 180 degrees. For an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), its complement and supplement cannot be equal because their sums with the angle lead to different total degrees (90 vs. 180).   - Conclusion: Incorrect.

Recall that the interior angles of a polygon sum to: [ 180^circ (n-2) ] 2. When the ( n )-sided polygon is divided into ( K ) triangles by diagonals, the total sum of the interior angles of all triangles is also: [ 180^circ times K ] 3. Equating both expressions, since the angles sum must be equal: [ 180^circ times K = 180^circ (n-2) ] 4. Now, solve for ( K ): [ K = n-2 ] Hence, the number of triangles ( K ) into which the polygon is divided is ( n-2 ) for any triangulation of an ( n )-sided convex polygon. **(b) Show that there is always a vertex with the number 1.** Consider any given triangulation of the ( n )-sided convex polygon and let ( A B ) be a diagonal that separates the smallest chain of consecutive vertices ( A, C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k, B ). 1. To show that ( k = 1 ), suppose ( k > 1 ). This implies there are more than two vertices in the chain. For triangulation to occur, there must be a diagonal within the vertex set ( {A, C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k, B} ). 2. However, if such a diagonal exists, it contradicts the assumption that ( A B ) encloses the smallest chain since this diagonal within ({A, C_1, ldots, B}) would produce an even smaller subchain. 3. Therefore, the smallest chain implies that only one vertex ( C_1 ) exists between ( A ) and ( B ) making ( k = 1 ). This means the triangle involving vertex ( C_1 ) has ( A B ) as one of its sides, and so, ( C_1 ) appears in exactly one triangle containing the side ( A B ). Thus, at least one of the vertices will have the number 1 written on it. Additionally, it's possible to demonstrate that at least two such vertices exist. **(c) Using the previous result to find a method to redraw the diagonals.** Using the vertex labeled with the number 1 as a starting point: 1. Identify a vertex with the number 1. Since this vertex is part of exactly one triangle, its adjacent vertices (its neighbors) must be connected by a diagonal across the polygon. 2. Draw this diagonal. 3. Remove or ignore the triangle formed from further consideration, and then continue the same process within the remaining polygon, looking for vertices that now become members of exactly one triangle. 4. If at any stage there is no visible vertex marked with a 1, then the unknown number must be 1. By continuing this process, all the diagonals will eventually be re-drawn correctly. This systematic method ensures that Carlitos can reconstruct the original set of diagonals used for the triangulation.

We need to show that the common chord of these circles is perpendicular to the trapezoid's bases and passes through the intersection point of the non-parallel sides. 1. **Understanding the common chord of two circles**:    - Consider two circles with centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) and radii ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) respectively.    - The common chord, if it exists, is perpendicular to the line segment joining the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ). 2. **Localization of centers**:    - In the trapezoid ( ABCD ), let ( AC ) and ( BD ) be the diagonals.    - Since each diagonal is a diameter of the circles, the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) of the circles lie at the midpoints of diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) respectively. 3. **Midpoints relation**:    - Let the midpoints of ( AC ) and ( BD ) be ( M ) and ( N ) respectively.    - These midpoints ( M ) and ( N ) lie on the midline (or median line) of the trapezoid which is parallel to the bases ( AB ) and ( CD ). 4. **The perpendicularity proof**:    - As stated in step 1, the common chord of the circles is perpendicular to the line segment joining the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ).    - The line segment ( O_1O_2 ) is parallel to the trapezoid's bases and located at the midline of the trapezoid.    - Therefore, the common chord of the circles, which is perpendicular to ( O_1O_2 ), must be perpendicular to the bases ( AB ) and ( CD ). 5. **Intersection properties**:    - Let the common chord of the circles intersect the non-parallel sides ( AD ) and ( BC ) at the same point.    - Denote this intersection point as ( P ).    - ( P ) lies on both ( AD ) and ( BC ) and the common chord, thus passing through the intersection point of non-parallel sides of trapezoid ( ABCD ). 6. **Consequences and final equations**:    - If the common chord segments the longer base ( AB ) into segments ( u ) and ( v ), with the shorter base ( CD ) into segments ( m ) and ( p ), we have:      [      mq = uv = np,      ]      where ( q ) and ( p ) are the lengths of the segments formed by the intersection with the bases.

The smallest values of ( k ) are 0, 1, 2, ..., 14. For each ( k ), we compute:    [    operatorname{rk}(A) = 1369 - left( binom{k}{2} + 37 cdot 19 right)    ] 9. **Sum of the 15 Smallest Elements of ( S )**:    We need to compute the sum of the 15 smallest values of ( operatorname{rk}(A) ):    [    sum_{k=0}^{14} left( 1369 - left( binom{k}{2} + 37 cdot 19 right) right)    ] 10. **Final Calculation**:     [     sum_{k=0}^{14} left( 1369 - left( frac{k(k-1)}{2} + 37 cdot 19 right) right)     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     sum_{k=0}^{14} left( 1369 - left( frac{k(k-1)}{2} + 703 right) right) = sum_{k=0}^{14} left( 666 - frac{k(k-1)}{2} right)     ]     [     = 15 cdot 666 - sum_{k=0}^{14} frac{k(k-1)}{2}     ]     [     = 9990 - sum_{k=0}^{14} frac{k(k-1)}{2}     ]     [     = 9990 - frac{14 cdot 15 cdot 7}{6} = 9990 - 245 = 9745     ] The final answer is (boxed{9745})."},{"instruction":"Vasily is going to finish his institute in a year.

This involution mathcal{I} exchanges I_A and I.        - **Proof**:      - Consider omega, the circumcircle of triangle ABC. This circle has the angle bisector of widehat{BAC} as its symmetry axis.

According to the previous corollary, this involution will exchange the circumcircles of triangles BOA and DHC and similarly for BI_1A and DI_2C. The problem is thus solved under the assumption of parallel lines (AB) and (CD). 4. **General Case Without Parallelism**:    - Introduce M, the Miquel point of the quadrilateral formed by lines (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA). Consider the involution mathcal{I} centered at M that exchanges A with C and B with D.        - **Observation**:      - The circle BI_1A is also the polar circle of triangle ABM.

The profit equation based on these variables is: [ text{Profit per item} times text{Number of items sold per day} = 1200 ] Substituting the expressions for profit per item and number of items sold per day, we get: [ (90 - x - 50)(20 + 2x) = 1200 ] Simplifying this equation: [ (40 - x)(20 + 2x) = 1200 ] [ 800 + 80x - 20x - 2x^2 = 1200 ] [ -2x^2 + 60x - 400 = 0 ] [ x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of x: [ x_{1} = 10, quad x_{2} = 20 ] To provide customers with more benefits, we choose the larger reduction: [ x = 20 ] Therefore, each item should be reduced in price by boxed{20 text{ yuan}}.

Following a similar approach as in part (1), the profit per item is (90 - y - 50) yuan, and the average number of items sold per day is (20 + 2y). For a daily profit of 2000 yuan, the equation becomes: [ (90 - y - 50)(20 + 2y) = 2000 ] Simplifying this equation: [ (40 - y)(20 + 2y) = 2000 ] [ -2y^2 + 60y - 600 = 0 ] [ y^2 - 30y + 600 = 0 ] To check for real roots, we calculate the discriminant Delta: [ Delta = (-30)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 600 = 900 - 2400 = -1500 ] Since Delta < 0, the equation has no real roots, indicating that it is not possible to achieve a daily profit of 2000 yuan with this strategy. Therefore, making a daily profit of boxed{2000 text{ yuan}} is not possible."},{"instruction":"The task is to construct ( N ) points on a plane such that all distances between them are equal to prespecified values: for any two points ( M_{i} ) and ( M_{j} ), where ( i ) and ( j ) are any numbers from 1 to ( N ). a) Can this construction be done if the distances ( r_{i j} ) are specified in such a way that any set of 5 out of ( N ) points can be constructed? b) Is it sufficient to require that any set of 4 out of ( N ) points can be constructed? c) How does the answer change if the points are constructed not on a plane, but in space?

Each edge between two vertices is colored by one of three colors (representing the three different topics they exchange letters on). 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**:     Pick any vertex ( A ). Since ( A ) has 16 edges connected to it (one for each of the other 16 vertices), by the pigeonhole principle, at least ( lceil 16/3 rceil = 6 ) of these edges must be the same color. Without loss of generality, assume this color is red. 3. **Focus on These 6 Vertices**:    Let's denote the set of vertices connected to ( A ) by red edges as ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_6} ). 4. **Check Connections Within This Set**:    Consider any two vertices among ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_6 ). If any edge between two of these vertices is also red, then we have a red triangle ( (A, B_i, B_j) ). 5. **Assume No Red Edges Within the 6 Vertices**:    Suppose there are no red edges among ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_6 ). In this scenario, all the edges between these 6 vertices must either be green or blue. 6. **Application on Vertex ( B_1 )**:    Focus on vertex ( B_1 ). There are 5 edges connecting ( B_1 ) to ( B_2, B_3, ldots, B_6 ), and these are colored either green or blue. Again, by the pigeonhole principle, at least ( lceil 5/2 rceil = 3 ) of these edges must be the same color, say green. 7. **Connections Within a Subset**:    Suppose ( B_1 ) is connected to ( B_2, B_3, B_4 ) via green edges.  8. **Forming the Green Triangle**:    Consider any two vertices among ( B_2, B_3, B_4 ). If any edge between two of these vertices is green, then ( B_1 ) together with these two vertices form a green triangle. 9. **Assuming No Green Edges Within ( B_2, B_3, B_4 )**:    If there are no green edges between ( B_2, B_3, B_4 ), then all the edges among them must be blue. 10. **Conclusion**:    Consequently, ( B_2, B_3, ) and ( B_4 ) form a blue triangle.

For ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 8 ), define the vector ( v_i = (S_i, S_{i+1}, ldots, S_{i+7}) ). Since ( v_0, v_1, ldots, v_8 ) are 8-dimensional vectors and there are 9 such vectors, they must be linearly dependent. Therefore, there exist ( u_0, u_1, ldots, u_8 ), not all zero, such that:    [    u_0 v_0 + u_1 v_1 + dots + u_8 v_8 = 0    ]    If ( u_8 = 0 ), then ( T(x) = u_7 x^7 + u_6 x^6 + dots + u_0 ) is a good polynomial, contradicting Claim 1. Therefore, ( u_8 neq 0 ). It follows that:    [    T(x) = x^8 + frac{u_7}{u_8} x^7 + frac{u_6}{u_8} x^6 + dots + frac{u_0}{u_8}    ]    is a good polynomial. (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 3: Uniqueness of Monic Good Polynomial of Degree 8**: We claim that the monic good polynomial with degree 8 is unique.    **Proof of Claim 3**: Suppose, for contradiction, that there exist two different monic good polynomials of degree 8, ( T_1(x) ) and ( T_2(x) ). Then, ( R(x) = T_1(x) - T_2(x) ) must be a good polynomial. However, since ( T_1(x) ) and ( T_2(x) ) are both monic, (deg R < 8), contradicting Claim 1. Hence, the monic good polynomial of degree 8 is unique. (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 4: All Roots of ( Q ) are Real**: We claim that all roots of ( Q ) are real.    **Proof of Claim 4**: Assume, for contradiction, that not all roots of ( Q ) are real.

Since ( L(x) ) does not have any real roots, either ( L(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ) or ( L(x) < 0 ) for all ( x ). If we take ( P(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2) cdots (x - x_k) ), then ( V(QP) > 0 ) if ( L(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ), and ( V(QP) < 0 ) if ( L(x) < 0 ) for all ( x ).

We need to prove that there exist two neighboring squares (sharing a common edge) such that their numbers differ by at least ( n ). 2. **Neighboring Squares**: Two squares are considered neighbors if they share a common edge. This means that for any square numbered ( k ), its neighbors are the squares numbered ( k-1 ), ( k+1 ), ( k-n ), and ( k+n ), provided these numbers are within the valid range of ( 1 ) to ( n^2 ). 3. **Empty Squares Analysis**: We will analyze the number of empty squares that are neighbors to the already filled squares. If at any point, the number of such empty neighboring squares is at least ( n ), we can conclude that there must be two neighboring squares whose numbers differ by at least ( n ). 4. **Case Analysis**:     - **Case 1: Only a row is completed**: Suppose a row is completed but no column is completed. Since no column is completed, each column must have at least one empty square that is a neighbor to a filled square. Therefore, the number of empty squares neighboring the filled squares is at least ( n ).     - **Case 2: Only a column is completed**: This case is analogous to Case 1. If a column is completed but no row is completed, each row must have at least one empty square that is a neighbor to a filled square. Thus, the number of empty squares neighboring the filled squares is at least ( n ).     - **Case 3: A row and a column are completed simultaneously**: Just before a row and a column are completed simultaneously, there must be at least one empty square in each column that is a neighbor to a filled square. Hence, the number of empty squares neighboring the filled squares is at least ( n ). 5. **Conclusion**: From the above cases, we see that at any point when a row or a column is completed, the number of empty squares neighboring the filled squares is at least ( n ).

Applying this property, we can deduce that either x^2 - x = 5x - 5 or x^2 - x = 16 - (5x - 5) because C_{16}^{k} = C_{16}^{16-k}. Let's analyze both cases: 1. x^2 - x = 5x - 5:    Rearrange the equation to get all terms on one side:    x^2 - x - 5x + 5 = 0    x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0    Factor the quadratic equation:    (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0    Therefore, we have two potential solutions from this equation: x = 1 or x = 5. 2. x^2 - x = 16 - (5x - 5):    Simplify the equation:    x^2 - x = 16 - 5x + 5    x^2 - x + 5x - 21 = 0    x^2 + 4x - 21 = 0    Factor the quadratic equation:    (x + 7)(x - 3) = 0    This gives us two more potential solutions: x = -7 or x = 3. We must now verify which solutions are valid by checking if they satisfy the constraints of the binomial coefficient—specifically, if the bottom number of the coefficient is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the top number. Upon checking, we find that x = 5 and x = -7 are not valid because they either result in a negative number or a number greater than 16 in the binomial coefficient. Therefore, these solutions do not meet the problem's requirements. Thus, the valid solutions for the original equation are x = 1 and x = 3. So the answer is: boxed{x = 1} or boxed{x = 3}."},{"instruction":"For any connected planar multigraph ( G ), a set ( E subseteq E(G) ) is the edge set of a graph in ( G ) if and only if ( E^{*} := {e^{*} mid e in E} ) is a minimal cut of ( G^{*} ).","output":"1. **Understanding the Concepts:**     - Given a planar multigraph ( G ), we consider a subset ( E subseteq E(G) ) of the edge set of ( G ).     - We define ( E^* := { e^* mid e in E } ) as the set of dual edges corresponding to the edges in ( E ) in the dual graph ( G^* ).     - The task is to show that ( E^* ) is a minimal cut (a cut consisting of a minimum number of edges) in the dual graph ( G^* ). 2. **Condition Analysis:**     - According to the definitions provided:         1. Vertices ( v^*(f_1) ) and ( v^*(f_2) ) in ( G^* ) belong to the same connected component of ( G^* - E^* ) if and only if faces ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ) lie in the same region of ( mathbb{R}^2 setminus bigcup E ).         2. In ( G^* - E^* ), every path ( v^*(f_1) - v^*(f_2) ) corresponds to an arc in ( mathbb{R}^2 setminus bigcup E ) connecting ( f_1 ) and ( f_2 ). Conversely, every such arc ( P ) without intersection with ( V(G) ) defines a path in ( G^* - E^* ) between ( v^*(f_1) ) and ( v^*(f_2) ). 3. **Special Case for Circles:**     - If ( C ) is a cycle in ( G ) with ( E = E(C) ), the Jordan Curve Theorem implies that ( mathbb{R}^2 setminus bigcup E ) forms two connected components.     - Therefore, ( G^* - E^* ) has exactly two connected components, meaning ( E^* ) forms a minimal cut in ( G^* ). 4. **Generalization and Conclusion:**     - If ( E subseteq E(G) ) makes ( E^* ) a cut in ( G^* ) and by the special case above, every edge set forming a cut must correspond to a cycle in ( G ).     - Referencing Problem 4.2.4 and the previously stated corresponding relationship, it follows that ( E ) must contain the edges of some cycle ( C subseteq G ) for ( E^* ) to be a cut in ( G^* ).     - If ( E^* ) is a minimal cut, ( E ) cannot contain additional edges; thus, ( E = E(C) ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{E^{*} text{ is a minimal cut in } G^{*} text{ if and only if } E text{ is a cycle in } G.} ]"},{"instruction":"Let mathcal{P} be the parabola determined by the equation y = x^2.

The points ( (i, x_i) ) must form a convex sequence, meaning the points need to create a convex hull.  Step 1: Identify the Convex Hull The points ( (i, x_i) ) must form a convex polygon. For the sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{100} ) to form a convex sequence, every segment must respect the convexity condition, making ( x_i ) a convex combination of its neighbors.  Step 2: Ordering of Points Given uniform and independent distribution in ([0,1]), the probability for a valid sequence depends on the ordering of these points. We will consider how each part of the sequence contributes: - The (i-1) points ( (1, x_1), ldots, (i-1, x_{i-1}) ) to the left of the peak must themselves form a convex sequence. - Similarly, the remaining ( 100 - i ) points ( (i+1, x_{i+1}), ldots, (100, x_{100}) ) to the right of the peak must form another convex sequence.  Step 3: Counting Convex Sequences When placing the points in increasing convex order, with all strict inequalities, each subset ( {x_1, ldots, x_{i-1}} ) must be uniquely ordered, resulting in ( frac{1}{(i-1)!} ) probability for (i-1) elements, and ( frac{1}{(100-i)!} ) for the remaining. The sequences to the left and right of the peak can be treated as: [ frac{1}{(i-1)!} times frac{1}{(100-i)!}. ] Consequently, for each peak ( x_i ), the probability is: [ frac{1}{(100)!}. ]  Step 4: Summing Across Possible Peaks Since any of the ( x_i ) values could serve as the peak: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} frac{1}{(i-1)!(100-i)!} cdot frac{1}{100!}. ] Simplifying this, recognizing that for proper convex hull consideration, each (i) simplifies through binomial selection from double, yielded symmetrical analysis: [ frac{1}{100 cdot 100!^2} times binom{200}{99} ]  Conclusion Thus, the probability is given by: [ boxed{frac{1}{100 cdot 100!^{2}} binom{200}{99}} ]"},{"instruction":"The quadratic 10x^2 + 15x  20 has two real roots.

Hence, the answer is boxed{-5}.  Part 2: Calculating the Total Production of Masks by Xiao Fei in That Month To find the total deviation in production over the month, we sum the deviations for each day and multiply by the number of days they occurred, then add this to the planned production: - Total deviation = (-10 times 4) + (-5 times 7) + (10 times 13) + (15 times 5) + (20 times 1) = -40 - 35 + 130 + 75 + 20 = 150 packs - Average deviation per day = Total deviation / 30 days = 150 / 30 = 5 packs - Average daily production = Planned production + Average deviation = 100 + 5 = 105 packs Therefore, the average daily production of Xiao Fei in that month is boxed{105} packs.  Part 3: Calculating the Total Wage Earned on the Day with the Highest and Lowest Production of Masks To calculate the total wage for the month, we use the piece-rate wage system details provided: - Base wage for the month = Daily production times 30 days times 2 yuan per pack = 105 times 30 times 2 = 6300 yuan - Additional reward for excess production = (10 times 13 + 15 times 5 + 20) times 0.5 yuan = (130 + 75 + 20) times 0.5 = 112.5 yuan - Deduction for less production = (4 times 10 + 7 times 5) times 0.8 yuan = (40 + 35) times 0.8 = 60 yuan - Total wage for the month = Base wage + Additional reward - Deduction = 6300 + 112.5 - 60 = 6352.5 yuan Therefore, Xiao Fei's total wage for that month is boxed{6352.5} yuan."},{"instruction":"The slope angle of one asymptote of the hyperbola ( dfrac {x^{2}}{a^{2}} dfrac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > 0,b > 0)) is ( dfrac {π}{3}), and its eccentricity is (e).

Therefore, we have:    [    2^r equiv 2^s pmod{9}    ]    This implies:    [    2^r - 2^s equiv 0 pmod{9} implies 2^s (2^{r-s} - 1) equiv 0 pmod{9}    ]    Since (2^s) is not divisible by 9 (as (2) and (9) are coprime), it must be that:    [    2^{r-s} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{9} implies 9 mid (2^{r-s} - 1)    ] 3. **Number of digits constraint**: The number of digits of (2^r) and (2^s) must be the same because they are permutations of each other. The number of digits (d) of a number (n) can be approximated by:    [    d = lfloor log_{10} n rfloor + 1    ]    Therefore, for (2^r) and (2^s) to have the same number of digits:    [    lfloor log_{10} 2^r rfloor + 1 = lfloor log_{10} 2^s rfloor + 1    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    lfloor r log_{10} 2 rfloor = lfloor s log_{10} 2 rfloor    ]    Since (log_{10} 2 approx 0.3010), the difference (r - s) must be small enough to keep the number of digits the same. Typically, this means:    [    r leq s + 3    ]    Hence, (r - s) can be at most 3. 4. **Check divisibility by 9**: We need to check if (2^{r-s} - 1) is divisible by 9 for (r - s = 1, 2, 3):    - For (r - s = 1):      [      2^{1} - 1 = 1 quad (text{not divisible by 9})      ]    - For (r - s = 2):      [      2^{2} - 1 = 3 quad (text{not divisible by 9})      ]    - For (r - s = 3):      [      2^{3} - 1 = 7 quad (text{not divisible by 9})      ] 5. **Conclusion**: Since (2^{r-s} - 1) is not divisible by 9 for (r - s = 1, 2, 3), we have a contradiction.

Therefore, option A is correct. **Step 4: Using the Law of Sines to relate b and c** Applying the Law of Sines, we have: [ frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. ] **Step 5: Relating sin C and sin B** Given c-b=2bcos A, we infer that sin C - sin B = 2sin Bcos A. Also, knowing sin C = sin (A+B), we have: [ sin C = sin Acos B + cos Asin B. ] **Step 6: Finding the relation between angles A and B** This leads to the equation sin Acos B - cos Asin B = sin (A-B) = sin B. Since angle C is obtuse, meaning A-B=B, we conclude A=2B.

Let's denote this large sphere as having a radius ( R ), and the cube as having side length ( 2R ). The sphere will be tangent to all the faces of the cube. 2. **Connecting the Center of the Sphere with Vertices of the Cube:**    Next, we connect the center of the inscribed sphere to each of the vertices of the cube. Since a cube has 8 vertices, there are 8 lines connecting the center of the sphere to these vertices.  3. **Forming Pyramids within the Cube:**    Each set of four vertices lying on a single face of the cube (also forming a tetrahedron) will define a pyramid with the center of the sphere as the apex and the face of the cube as the base. Since the cube has 6 faces, we will have 6 pyramids formed within the cube. 4. **Inscribing Smaller Spheres into Each Pyramid:**    Consider each pyramid separately. The center of the inscribed sphere (which we denote as ( O )) is equidistant from all vertices of the cube face that form the base of the pyramid. The radius of the smaller spheres to be inscribed within each pyramid needs to be such that each of these smaller spheres is tangent to the sphere inscribed in the cube at their shared base. 5. **Tangency Condition for Smaller Spheres:**    Each smaller sphere, to touch the four others forming its base, must be correctly positioned. This positioning can mathematically be shown by ensuring each sphere's radius denoted by ( r ) and distances from the common touchpoints on the larger sphere. 6. **Conclusion of Inscribing 6 Spheres:**    By symmetry and geometric construction, it can be concluded that within the larger sphere, exactly 6 smaller spheres, each of equal radius, can be inscribed in such a manner that each smaller sphere touches exactly four others. This concludes the proof that it is indeed possible to inscribe 6 equal spheres within a larger sphere, each being tangent to exactly four others.

Let's label the vertices as K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{20}. The sides and diagonals of this polygon can be treated as chords in the circle. 3. **Concept of Parallel Chords**:    - Each convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides determines pairs of parallel chords with endpoints at vertices of the icosagon.    - Consider a chord connecting two adjacent vertices, say K_6K_7.

Since this is a linear function with a negative slope, it is monotonically decreasing on its domain left(-infty, 1right). As x approaches 1 from the left, f(x) approaches 1 (since f(1^-) = -1 + 2 = 1), and as x decreases without bound, f(x) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of f(x) for x < 1 is left(1, +inftyright). 2. **Given that the overall range of f(x) is left(0, +inftyright):**    This implies that for the part of the function defined for x geq 1, the range must include left(0, 1right] to complement the range left(1, +inftyright) and achieve the overall range of left(0, +inftyright). 3. **For x geq 1:**    The function is defined as f(x) = frac{a}{x}. For the range of this part of the function to include left(0, 1right], a must be greater than 0; otherwise, f(x) would be non-positive for x geq 1, contradicting the given range requirement. 4. **Monotonicity of f(x) = frac{a}{x} for x geq 1:**    Since a > 0, f(x) = frac{a}{x} is monotonically decreasing on left[1, +inftyright). This implies that as x increases, f(x) decreases from frac{a}{1} = a towards 0. Therefore, the range of this part of the function is left(0, aright]. 5. **Combining the Requirements:**    To ensure that left(0, 1right] is included in the range of left(0, aright], it must be that a geq 1. This ensures that the overall range of f(x), combining both parts of its definition, is indeed left(0, +inftyright).

We express the sum of the sines of the angles:        sin A + sin B + sin C     3.

Combine the terms getting a common denominator: [ y = frac{1 - cos 2x + sqrt{3} sin 2x}{2} ] 4. Factor the expression inside the fraction: [ y = frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3} sin 2x - cos 2x}{2} ] 5. Recognize that the expression (sqrt{3} sin 2x - cos 2x) can be rewritten using the angle addition formula. This requires expressing it as a single sine function. First, note that: [ sqrt{3} sin 2x - cos 2x = sin left(2x - frac{pi}{3}right) ] 6. Substitute this into ( y ), then we have: [ y = frac{1}{2} + sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) ] 7. To find the range of ( y ), determine the range of ( sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) ). The given range of ( x ) is ( frac{pi}{4} leqslant x leqslant frac{pi}{2} ): [ frac{pi}{2} leqslant 2x leqslant pi ] Subtract (frac{pi}{6}) from each part of the inequality: [ frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} leqslant 2x - frac{pi}{6} leqslant pi - frac{pi}{6} ] [ frac{pi}{3} leqslant 2x - frac{pi}{6} leqslant frac{5pi}{6} ] 8. The sine function over the interval (left[ frac{pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6} right]) has a range of: [ sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) in left[sin frac{pi}{3}, sin frac{5pi}{6}right] ] Since (sin frac{pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) and (sin frac{5pi}{6} = frac{1}{2}), we have: [ sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) in left[frac{1}{2}, 1right] ] 9. Therefore, substituting these bounds back into ( y = frac{1}{2} + sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) ), we get the range of ( y ): [ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} leqslant y leqslant frac{1}{2} + 1 ] [ 1 leqslant y leqslant frac{3}{2} ] 10. Finally, the range of ( y ) is: [ y in left[1, frac{3}{2}right] ] (boxed{y in left[1, frac{3}{2}right]})"},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Since the wind only affects the rowing speed in the direction of the stream, we can consider the wind's speed to be added to the boat's speed when going downstream and have no effect when going upstream. When the man rows against the stream (upstream), his effective speed is ( B - S ) because the stream is working against him. When he rows with the stream (downstream), his effective speed is ( B + S + W ) because both the stream and the wind are aiding him. According to the problem, it takes twice as long to row upstream as it does to row downstream. This means that the distance covered upstream in a certain time is half the distance covered downstream in the same time. Therefore, we can write the following equation based on the time ratio: [ frac{B - S}{B + S + W} = frac{1}{2} ] However, we are not given the speed of the wind, and it is not factored into the ratio we need to find. We are looking for the ratio of the speed of the boat to the average speed of the stream, which is ( frac{B}{S} ). To find this ratio without the wind speed, we need to eliminate ( W ) from our equation. Since the wind only affects the downstream speed, we can consider the scenario without the wind. In this case, the downstream speed would be ( B + S ), and the ratio of times would still be 2:1. Therefore, we can write: [ frac{B - S}{B + S} = frac{1}{2} ] Now, we can solve for ( frac{B}{S} ): [ 2(B - S) = B + S ] [ 2B - 2S = B + S ] [ 2B - B = 2S + S ] [ B = 3S ] So the ratio of the speed of the boat to the average speed of the stream is: [ frac{B}{S} = frac{3S}{S} = 3:1 ] Therefore, the ratio of the speed of the boat (in still water) to the average speed of the stream is boxed{3:1} ."},{"instruction":"Find [sum_{n = 1}^infty frac{2^n}{1 + 2^n + 2^{n + 1} + 2^{2n + 1}}.]","output":"To solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the denominator of the given sum.

Solving the inequality involves finding the intervals for x where this product doesn't exceed zero: - The first factor, x, is zero when x = 0. - The second factor, x - 1, is zero when x = 1. - For x < 0, both factors are negative, which makes their product positive—this does not satisfy the inequality. - For 0 < x < 1, the first factor (x) is positive, and the second factor (x - 1) is negative, making their product non-positive—this satisfies the inequality. - For x > 1, both factors are positive, which makes their product positive—this does not satisfy the inequality.

Step 3: Arranging Numbers in the Grid For all rows and diagonals to have an odd sum, a possible placement is to have all odd numbers along one diagonal and part of two rows that intersect at the diagonal, ensuring that the rest of the numbers in those rows are even. Step 4: Counting Valid Placements - Choose a diagonal (2 ways - main diagonal or anti-diagonal). - Arrange 3 odd numbers in the diagonal (5 times 4 times 3 = 60 ways). - Arrange the remaining 2 odd numbers in the intersection of the rows and columns of the diagonal (2 times 1 = 2 ways). - Arrange 4 even numbers in the remaining spaces (4! = 24 ways).

Applying this to our equation gives us f(-x) = -f(x) = f(x+2). 4. **Combining Properties:**    - From the property f(-x) = -f(x), we can combine this with our derived equation to get f(x+2) = -f(x). This is a crucial step. 5. **Extending the Property:**    - Extending the property f(x+2) = -f(x), we apply it again to get f(x+4) = f(x+2+2) = -f(x+2) = f(x). This step shows that the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis. 6. **Finding f(4):**    - Applying the derived property f(x+4) = f(x), we set x=0 to find f(4). Since we know f(0) = 0 for odd functions, we find that f(4) = f(0) = 0. Therefore, by analyzing the properties of odd and even functions and methodically applying them to the given function f(x), we conclude that f(4) = 0.

The second piece of information tells us that when the digits in the tens and ones places are swapped, the resulting number is 9 less than the original number. The original number can be represented as 10x + y (since x is in the tens place and y is in the ones place), and the number after swapping the digits is 10y + x.

Step 3: Evaluate (a) and determine (b) We test values of (a) in decreasing order to identify a valid combination: 1. **For (a = 9)**:    - Calculate (792 + 9 times 9 = 873).    - Factorize 873: (873 = 9 times 97).    - Check divisors: (9 + a + b) should be between 17 and 26 (possible (b) values range from 0 to 9, making (8 + 9 + b) between 17 and 26).    - Check divisors between 17 and 26: 873 has no appropriate divisors. 2. **For (a = 8)**:    - Calculate (792 + 9 times 8 = 864).    - Factorize 864: (864 = 2^5 times 3^3).    - Check divisors between 16 and 25.    - Largest divisor: (24), making (b = 24 - 8 - 8 = 8). By this logic and calculation: - (a = 8) and (b = 8), leading to the number (800 + 80 + 8 = 888).

(The distances are understood to be in absolute value.)","output":"To find the locus of points relative to a rectangle of sides a and b, such that the sum of their distances from the sides of the rectangle equals a + b + c, we proceed as follows: 1. **Consider the rectangle:**    - Let the rectangle be ABCD with sides AB = a and BC = b.    - Assume c is a given segment. 2. **Understand the sum of distances within the rectangle:**    - For any point inside the rectangle or on its sides, the sum of the distances to the sides of the rectangle is always a + b.    - Therefore, points inside the rectangle do not satisfy the given condition because a + b neq a + b + c. 3. **Analyze points outside the rectangle:**    - Consider points in the half-planes outside AB and CD.     - For these points, the sum of the distances from AB and CD increases by b plus twice the distance from the point to the nearest of these two lines.        Similar logic applies to the half-planes outside AD and BC with an increase by a plus twice the distance from the point to the nearest line. 4. **Construct perpendiculars:**    - Set up segments:      - On the extension of AD beyond A and D, mark points A_1 and D_1 such that AA_1 = DD_1 = frac{c}{2}.      - On the extension of BC beyond B and C, mark points B_1 and C_1 such that BB_1 = CC_1 = frac{c}{2}. 5. **Identify correct regions:**    - For points satisfying the given condition in the half-planes outside AB and CD, the corresponding points lie on line segments A_1B_1 and C_1D_1 because these are the loci where the distances to AB and CD add up to b + c.    - Similarly, for points outside AD and BC, we have points on line segments A_2D_2 and B_2C_2, where the distances add up to a + c. 6. **Verify with an example point ( P ):**    - Let ( P ) be a point in the external angular region of BAD.    - With P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4 being the projections on AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively:      - We observe:        ( PP_2 = PP_4 + P_4P_2 = PP_4 + a ) and ( PP_3 = PP_1 + P_1P_3 = PP_1 + b ).      - Therefore, sum of distances equals  PP_1 + PP_4 = frac{c}{2}  when considering necessary shifts. 7. **Forming boundaries:**    - Place point P such that distance checks hold true for all quadrants.    - Construct shapes considering line extensions leading to definite polygons:      - Those within ( B, A, D ) triangle or external vertices A_1B_1B_2C_2C_1D_1D_2A_2 close-looping region. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Finally, the geometric place ensuring described criteria lies on the boundary A_1B_1B_2C_2C_1D_1D_2A_2 and all interior pointX [ boxed{A_1 B_1 B_2 C_2 C_1 D_1 D_2 A_2} ]."},{"instruction":"A line passes through points C (2,3) and D (101, 503).

From this, we can express OP^2 as follows: OP^2 = x_0^2 + y_0^2 = (y_0 + 2)^2 + y_0^2. Since Q lies on the circle C with radius 1, we have OQ = 1. At the maximum angle angle OPQ, point Q will be such that PQ is tangent to the circle at Q, forming a right triangle OPQ with the right angle at Q. Therefore, when angle OPQ = 30^circ, we have: sin(30^circ) = frac{OQ}{OP} = frac{1}{OP}. Given that sin(30^circ) = frac{1}{2}, we find: frac{1}{OP} = frac{1}{2}, which implies: OP = 2. Since OP cannot be longer than 2, otherwise angle OPQ would be less than 30^circ at any position of Q on the circle, we then have: OP^2 leq 4. Substituting the expression for OP^2 we found earlier: (y_0 + 2)^2 + y_0^2 leq 4, Expanding and simplifying: 2y_0^2 + 4y_0 + 4 leq 4, which reduces to: y_0^2 + 2y_0 leq 0.

Hence, there is at least one color that has fewer than (100) chips. 3. **Number of Neighbors for Each Color**:    - The maximum number of neighbors for any chip of a specific color is bounded by the total number of chips minus one (since we are placing them on a circle, each chip has exactly two neighbors).    - Hence, if there are fewer than (100) chips of any color, these chips can form segments with other colors but not with themselves more than (99) times. 4. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - Consider the color, let's call it color (A), which has fewer than (100) chips.    - The chips of color (A) are placed around the circle. Since there are (200) different colors and each chip of color (A) could potentially be next to at most (198) other chips (excluding itself), there must be some color (B) among the remaining (199) colors that is not adjacent with color (A) consecutively. Therefore, the conclusion arises from the fact that there are not enough chips for each color to have (100) chips, ensuring that there exists at least one pair of colors whose chips are not placed next to each other around the circle. Thus, we have proved that there exists such a pair of colors. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"a certain exam, there are 5 multiple choice questions, each with 4 different answers to choose from.

According to the given information, B invests two-thirds of what C invests, so B's investment would be (2/3)x. A invests 3 times as much as B, so A's investment would be 3 * (2/3)x = 2x. Now, the total investment is the sum of investments by A, B, and C, which is 2x + (2/3)x + x = (7/3)x. The profit is distributed among the partners in the ratio of their investments. So, the ratio of A's investment to B's investment to C's investment is 2x : (2/3)x : x, which simplifies to 6:2:3 after multiplying all terms by 3 to get rid of the fraction.

Let's break it down: 1. **Understanding the coin denominations and their properties modulo 7:**        - Coins on the moon have denominations of 1, 15, and 50 fertings.    - The remainder when dividing each denomination by 7:      [      1 mod 7 equiv 1       ]      [      15 mod 7 equiv 1       ]      [      50 mod 7 equiv 1       ]    - Each coin denomination leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. 2. **Formulating the problem in terms of modulus arithmetic:**    - Suppose Neznayka paid a total amount ( A ) using ( k ) coins.    - Since each coin leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, the total amount ( A ) also leaves a remainder of ( k ) when divided by 7.      [      A equiv k (mod 7)      ] 3. **Understanding the change issue:**    - Neznayka received ( C ) as change and he received one more coin than he used to purchase the item.    - Since every coin leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, the change ( C ) in terms of modulus 7 can be expressed as:      [      C equiv k + 1 (mod 7)      ] 4. **Expressing the purchase price in terms of ( A ) and ( C ):**    - The price of the purchase is the difference between the total paid amount ( A ) and the change received ( C ):      [      A - C = A - (k + 1) equiv k - (k + 1) equiv -1 (mod 7)      ]    - Since subtracting 1 modulo 7 is the same as adding 6:      [      A - C equiv 6 (mod 7)      ] 5. **Finding the minimum possible positive value for the purchase price:**    - The smallest positive value that satisfies ( A - C equiv 6 (mod 7) ) is:      [      A - C equiv 6 text{ fertings}      ] Therefore, the smallest possible price of the purchase is: [ boxed{6 text{ fertings}} ] Example to illustrate: - Neznayka pays with 1 coin of 1 ferting and 1 coin of 50 fertings, totaling:   [   1 + 50 = 51 text{ fertings}   ] - He receives change in the form of 3 coins of 15 fertings, totaling:   [   15 times 3 = 45 text{ fertings}   ] - Therefore, the purchase price is:   [   51 - 45 = 6 text{ fertings}   ] The reasoning holds correctly with the coins and modulus arithmetic, ensuring that the smallest possible purchase price is indeed 6 fertings."},{"instruction":"The circle inscribed in triangle ABC touches the sides AB, BC, and AC at points C_1, A_1, and B_1 respectively.

It is also given that ( AC_1 = BA_1 = CB_1 ). 1. Recall the property of tangents from a common external point to a circle: the lengths of tangents drawn from a single point to the points of tangency are equal. Therefore, we can write:    [    AC_1 = AB_1, quad BA_1 = BC_1, quad CB_1 = CA_1    ] 2. Given ( AC_1 = BA_1 = CB_1 ), we can use these equalities to deduce that point ( C_1 ) is the midpoint of side ( AB ).

Since ( C_1 ), ( A_1 ), and ( B_1 ) are the midpoints of ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( AC ) respectively, each side of the triangle can be expressed as twice the length from a vertex to the point where the circle touches that side:    [    AB = 2AC_1, quad BC = 2BA_1, quad AC = 2CB_1    ] 4.

Given the recurrence relation:          a_{n+1} a_{n} - a_{n}^{2} = 1,          we note that a_{n} neq 0 for any ( n ). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:          a_{n+1} = a_{n} + frac{1}{a_{n}}.      2.

Thus, by the property of ( f ), we have:    [    f(z_1) + f(z_1 + (z_2 - z_1) omega^k) + cdots + f(z_1 + (z_n - z_1) omega^k) = 0.    ] 6. **Simplification**:    Since all the points form a symmetric ( n )-gon around ( z_1 ), we focus on symmetry and cyclic sum properties:    [    sum_{k=1}^n f(z_1 + a omega^k) = 0.    ]    In particular, for ( k = 0 ):    [    f(z_1) bigg(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} omega^kbigg) = 0.    ] 7. **Sum of Roots of Unity**:    The sum of the ( n )-th roots of unity is zero:    [    sum_{k=0}^{n-1} omega^k = 0.    ] 8. **Final Argument**:    Therefore, we have:    [    n f(z) = 0.    ]    Where ( n ne 0 ).

Otherwise, if the cards are of different suits, they either both tell the truth or both lie.  1. **Assumption: Both cards are of the same suit.**     - Given this assumption, one of the brothers must be lying.     - Since they both claim their name is Treljalya, according to our principle, one of them is lying about their name, indicating that both cards are indeed of the same suit. 2. **Determine the suit of the cards:**     - Suppose both cards are **purple**.         - If both cards are purple, then the first brother's second statement (\\"My brother has an orange-suit card.\\") must be false.         - If this statement is false, the first brother's first statement (\\"My name is Treljalya.\\") is also false.

Initially, the circle's center is at ((0, a/2)), and we are observing the point on this circle initially located at ((0, a)). 2. **Position After Rolling by Angle (theta):**    When the circle has rolled by an angle (theta), the point we are observing, initially at ((0, a)), can be described in a coordinate system where the center of the circle, (C), is at ((atheta/2, a/2)).    The position of the point relative to the center is:    [    left( frac{a}{2} sin theta, frac{a}{2} cos theta right)    ]    Thus, in the rolling coordinate system, the point (P) is at:    [    P left( frac{atheta}{2} + frac{a}{2} sin theta, frac{a}{2} + frac{a}{2} cos theta right)    ] 3. **Tangent at Point (P):**    The tangent to the curve (C) at the point (P) can be found using the coordinates of (P). The slope of the tangent at (P) is:    [    text{slope} = frac{d(P_y)}{d(P_x)} = frac{-sin theta}{1 + cos theta}    ]    This leads to the tangent line equation:    [    frac{y - frac{a}{2}(1 + cos theta)}{x - left( frac{a theta}{2} + frac{a}{2} sin theta right)} = frac{-sin theta}{1 + cos theta}    ]    Rearranging this equation, we get:    [    x sin theta + y (1 - cos theta) = frac{a}{2} (theta sin theta + 2 cos theta + 2)    ] 4. **Converting Variables:**    Let (theta = 2 phi).

When it has rolled through an angle (phi), its center moves to ((aphi, a)). The diameter of this circle, which was initially horizontal, now lies on the line:    [    frac{y - a}{x - aphi} = -tan phi    ]    which leads to:    [    x sin phi + y cos phi = a (phi sin phi + cos phi)    ]    This is precisely the same tangent equation derived for the smaller circle of radius (a/2). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the envelope of the diameters of the larger circle of radius (a) while rolling along the x-axis is the same as the curve traced by a point on the circumference of a smaller circle of radius (a/2) rolling along the x-axis.

Since the sum of each repeating subsequence is zero (i.e., a_{6k+1}+a_{6k+2}+a_{6k+3}+a_{6k+4}+a_{6k+5}+a_{6k+6}=0), we can pair the terms of S_{2002} in groups of 6 to cancel them out.

Calculating ZW: - Height of trapezoid ZWCD = 20 - 7 = 13 (assuming the total height from A to D is 20 units). - Since area ZWCD = 154, we utilize the trapezoid area formula:     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times (text{Base}_1 + text{Base}_2) times text{Height} = frac{1}{2} times (14 + 14) times h = 154  - Thus, 28 times h = 154 implies h = frac{154}{28} = 5.5 units of height. Therefore, triangle BZW will also have a baseline of 14 units, and height 3.5 from B to W, excluding height 2 from W to CD (as 20 - 5.5 - 7 = 7.5, half of which is height from W to Z and the other half W to B).

The problem states that the cost of purchasing basketballs for 6000 yuan is 1.25 times the cost of purchasing soccer balls for 3200 yuan. This relationship can be formulated as: [ frac{6000}{x + 20} = 1.25 times frac{3200}{x} ] Simplifying this equation: [ frac{6000}{x + 20} = frac{4000}{x} ] Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions: [ 6000x = 4000(x + 20) ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 6000x = 4000x + 80000 ] Subtracting 4000x from both sides: [ 2000x = 80000 ] Dividing by 2000: [ x = 40 ] Therefore, the unit price of each soccer ball is 40 yuan.

The remaining percentage of toys are blue, which are equally distributed among the three sizes. Furthermore, it is known that there are 40 green and large toys in the lot.

We know that 35% of the toys are green and that there are 40 green and large toys, which represent the remaining percentage of green toys after accounting for the small and medium ones. Let's calculate the percentage of green toys that are large: 100% (total green toys) - 5% (small green toys) - 15% (medium green toys) = 80% (large green toys) Now, we know that 80% of the green toys are large, and there are 40 green and large toys. We can set up a proportion to find the total number of green toys (G): 80% of G = 40 toys 0.80 * G = 40 G = 40 / 0.80 G = 50 So, there are 50 green toys in total. Since green toys make up 35% of the total number of toys, we can find the total number of toys (T) in the lot: 35% of T = 50 toys 0.35 * T = 50 T = 50 / 0.35 T = 142.857... (approximately) Since we can't have a fraction of a toy, let's round this to the nearest whole number. The total number of toys is approximately 143. Now, let's find out how many of the toys are red. We know that 40% of the toys are red: 40% of 143 toys = 0.40 * 143 = 57.2 Again, we can't have a fraction of a toy, so we'll round to the nearest whole number. There are approximately 57 red toys in the lot. Finally, we need to find out how many of the red toys are large.

Define ( gamma = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} ). The key idea is to use the identity ( 1 - 2gamma + gamma^2 = gamma ). 2. **Define Families ( T ) and ( S )**:    - Let the family ( T ) be all subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) that include at least one integer ( r pmod{b} ) for any residue ( r ).    - Let the family ( S ) be all subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) not in ( T ) that include all integers ( r pmod{b} ) for some residue ( r ). 3. **Count the Size of ( T )**:    The number of subsets in ( T ) is given by:    [    |T| = (2^a - 1)^b    ] 4. **Count the Size of ( S )**:    To count ( |S| ), we first subtract from ( 2^{ab} ) the number of subsets that do not have all the integers ( r pmod{b} ) for any residue ( r ), which is ( (2^a - 1)^b ). This gives:    [    2^{ab} - (2^a - 1)^b    ]    Next, we subtract the elements in ( T ). The number of subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) that include at least one integer, but not all integers ( r pmod{b} ) for any residue ( r ), is ( (2^a - 2)^b ).

The number of terms in the series is ( 2016 cdot 2017^2 + 1 ). 2. **Sum of the Geometric Series**:    The sum of a geometric series ( sum_{n=0}^{N} r^n ) is given by:    [    S = frac{r^{N+1} - 1}{r - 1}    ]    Here, ( r = 2018 ) and ( N = 2016 cdot 2017^2 ).

Which player can guarantee themselves a victory regardless of the opponent's moves?","output":"Consider a board of size (2020 times 2021). Petya and Vasya take turns placing chips on empty cells of the board, starting with Petya. The player who makes a move resulting in every (4 times 4) square on the board containing at least one chip wins. We need to determine if there is a strategy guaranteeing a victory irrespective of the opponent's moves, and if so, which player has it. 1. **Initial Considerations**:    - The board is of size (2020 times 2021), so it has (2020 times 2021) cells in total.    - The aim is to ensure that each (4 times 4) square on the board has at least one chip. 2. **Key Idea**:    - Vasya must play in such a way that Petya never achieves a win on his next move. Specifically, Vasya should always place his chip in some (4 times 4) square that remains partially empty, extending the game without letting Petya win immediately. 3. **Empty (4 times 4) Squares**:    - If after each move by Petya, the board has at least two non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares with empty cells, Petya must place a chip in one of these squares.    - Vasya can always place his chip in the other non-overlapping (4 times 4) square, thus ensuring Petya doesn't win. 4. **Critical Scenario**:    - Suppose at some stage, the board is such that there are only two empty non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares left. When Petya places his chip, one of these squares will have at least one chip, leaving one (4 times 4) square completely empty.    - Now, Vasya places his chip in this last (4 times 4) square. This ensures both remaining squares have at least one chip and the game continues.  5. **Conclusion: Cheating Detection**:    - Suppose there are less than two pairs of non-overlapping (4 times 4) squares to choose from. This means all remaining (4 times 4) squares on the board overlap in such a way that placing a chip in one affects others.    - If any placement exists where Petya can place a chip leading to all (4 times 4) squares getting filled, Vasya can block this by ensuring such placement completes at his turn.    - Petya places a chip such that overlapping configurations leave some (4 times 4) squares with empty slots. Vasya's next move targets these coordinates, blocking immediate completion and securing his win eventually when configurations condense. Combining all these, Vasya can always ensure Petya's move won't satisfy the winning condition. Therefore, playing optimally, Vasya will always win regardless of Petya's actions.

Since the hexagon is irregular and composed of 1-inch squares, we can't directly apply Pick's Theorem. Instead, we'll use a geometric approach. First, let's visualize the hexagon. It's made up of 78 squares, with an overall length of 12 inches. This means that the hexagon extends 12 squares along its longest diagonal. The hexagon also has two widths, 8 inches and 6 inches, which correspond to 8 squares and 6 squares respectively. To find out through how many squares the diagonal from the left-most point to the right-most point passes, we can use the fact that the diagonal will pass through at least one square in each column of squares along its length. Since the hexagon is 12 inches long, there are 12 columns of squares along the diagonal. However, the diagonal will also pass through additional squares in some columns due to the widths of 8 inches and 6 inches. The diagonal will pass through more than one square in a column whenever it crosses a horizontal or vertical boundary between squares. To determine the exact number of squares the diagonal passes through, we would need to know the specific arrangement of the squares within the hexagon.

However, we can say that the diagonal will pass through at least 12 squares (one for each column) and potentially more depending on the arrangement of the squares.

To find the maximum possible value of f(2019), follow these steps: 1. **Understanding the Graph Representation:**     - Consider a graph where each integer (m) is a vertex.     - There is an edge between ((n + 1)2^k) and (n2^k) for all integers (k geq 0) and (n).     - Each vertex (m) has a value (f(m)).     - The condition (left|fleft((n+1) 2^kright) - fleft(n 2^kright)right| leq 1) means that adjacent vertices have values differing by at most 1. 2. **Functon Constraint Implications:**     - For any vertex (m), (f(m)) must be less than or equal to the number of edges in the shortest path from (0) to (m). This is because the value can increase by at most 1 along each edge.     - Conversely, determining (f(m)) as the number of edges in the shortest path from (0) to (m) satisfies the given properties for (f). 3. **Finding Shortest Path:**     - We need to compute the shortest path from (0) to (2019).     - We can decompose (2019) as follows:       [       0 rightarrow 2048 rightarrow 2016 rightarrow 2018 rightarrow 2019       ]     - Verified path:         - (2048) (which is (2^{11}))         - (2016 = 2048 - 32) (closest lower power of 2 combination, (32 = 2^5))         - (2018 = 2016 + 2)         - (2019 = 2018 + 1)     - The total number of edges along this path is 4. 4. **Path Verification and Constraints:**     - Check if a valid path of 3 or fewer edges exists:       - Suppose it exists, then in each step, the number changes by a power of 2.       - (2019) in terms of power of 2 variations: (2019 = pm 2^{k_1} pm 2^{k_2} pm 2^{k_3}) for nonnegative integers (k_1, k_2, k_3).       - Since (2019) is odd, one term must be (2^0 = 1).       - This implies two other terms form (pm 2^{k_1} pm 2^{k_2} in {2018, 2020}).       - Factorizations:         - (2018 = 2 times 1009)         - (2020 = 4 times 505)       - None of these terms match the form (2^{k_2}(2^{k_1-k_2} pm 1)) required for valid powers of 2 differences.       - Therefore, it is not possible to achieve a valid 3-step path meeting the criteria. 5. **Conclusion:**     - The shortest path with valid steps according to the problem constraints is the four-edge path determined earlier.     - Thus, (f(2019) = 4) is the maximum value given the conditions. Therefore, the maximum possible value of (f(2019)) is [ boxed{4} ]"},{"instruction":"The minimum value of the function y=x+2cos x on the interval [0,pi] is ______.","output":"To find the minimum value of y=x+2cos x on the interval [0,pi], we need to analyze the behavior of the function.

Given that three times as many children as adults attend, we can express the number of children as 3X. The total revenue collected from ticket sales is given by the sum of the revenue from adult tickets and child tickets. The cost of an adult ticket is 7, and the cost of a child's ticket is 3. Therefore, the total revenue can be expressed as the sum of 7 times the number of adults plus 3 times the number of children. This gives us the equation: [ 7X + 3(3X) = 6000 ] Simplifying the equation by multiplying through the parentheses, we get: [ 7X + 9X = 6000 ] Combining like terms, we find: [ 16X = 6000 ] To find the number of adults (X), we divide both sides of the equation by 16: [ X = frac{6000}{16} = 375 ] Therefore, the number of adults attending the concert is 375. To find the number of children attending, we multiply this number by 3 (since there are three times as many children as adults): [ 375 times 3 = 1125 ] Finally, to find the total number of people attending the concert, we add the number of adults to the number of children: [ 375 + 1125 = 1500 ] Thus, the total number of people who bought tickets to the concert is boxed{1500}."},{"instruction":"Let ( E ) be an ellipse and in the plane of this ellipse, we choose a line ( H ) which is perpendicular to one of its axes.

We need to consider a line H which is perpendicular to one of the axes of the ellipse. Without loss of generality, we can assume H is parallel to the y-axis, i.e., of the form x = m. The circle h associated with the line H needs to tangentially relate to the ellipse in a specific way. To find this, let the equation of the circle be: [ (x - p)^2 + y^2 = zeta^2 ] where (p, 0) is the center, and zeta is the radius of the circle. The point M(x, y) lies on the ellipse. From this point, a tangent to the circle has a length squared given by: [ t^2 = (x - p)^2 + y^2 - zeta^2 ] The distance of the point M from the line H is given by: [ d^2 = (x - m)^2 ] According to the problem statement, the squared length of the tangent from any point M on the ellipse to the circle, relative to the distance squared from the line H, is constant: [ (x - p)^2 + y^2 - zeta^2 = k(x - m)^2 ] where k is a constant. Next, we need to satisfy this condition for any point M on the ellipse. Particularly for when M is the endpoint of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, we get distinct scenarios: 1. For M at (a, 0):  [ (a - p)^2 - zeta^2 = k(a - m)^2 ] 2. For M at (-a, 0): [ (a + p)^2 - zeta^2 = k(a + m)^2 ] 3. For M at (0, b): [ p^2 + b^2 - zeta^2 = k m^2 ] Using these, we can solve for k, p, and zeta: The equations yield: [ begin{aligned} (a - p)^2 - zeta^2 &= k(a - m)^2,  (a + p)^2 - zeta^2 &= k(a + m)^2,  p^2 + b^2 - zeta^2 &= k m^2. end{aligned} ] Subtracting the first from the second: [ (a - p)^2 - (a + p)^2 = k(a - m)^2 - k(a + m)^2  ] [ -4ap = -4amk ] Thus, [ p = mk ] With p = mk substituted back: [ k = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = frac{c^2}{a^2} = E^2 ] where E is the eccentricity of the ellipse, E = frac{c}{a}, and c^2 = a^2 - b^2. So, [ p = frac{c^2}{a^2}m ] And substituting p in the circular equation: [ zeta^2 = b^2 - p^2left(frac{b^2}{a^2}right) ] [ zeta^2 = b^2left(1 - frac{c^2m^2}{a^4}right) ] Thus, the value of zeta and positioning for the circle can be determined appropriately. # For  p = 0, we have maximum radius: [ zeta_{text{max}} = b ] # For p = c: [ zeta_{text{min}} = 0 ] Hence the circle will lie entirely within the ellipse, touching it at exactly two points on the line x = m. This ensures the circle never exceeds the bounds of the ellipse and validates its tangency given the condition applied. In conclusion, the values are: [ boxed{ begin{aligned} k &= frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = E^2  p &= frac{c^2}{a^2} m  zeta^2 &= b^2 left(1 - frac{p^2}{c^2}right) end{aligned} } ]"},{"instruction":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} where all terms are positive, and a_6 cdot a_{10} + a_3 cdot a_5 = 26, a_5 cdot a_7 = 5, find the value of a_4 + a_8.

In this sequence arrangement: - HT occurs four times (H to T), - TH occurs five times (T to H).

This follows because:    [    nu_p(ba_i + ab_i) = nu_p(b_i)    ]    and since (nu_p(ba_i) > nu_p(ab_i)), we have:    [    nu_p(b_{i+1}) geq nu_p(b)    ] 4. **Lemma 2**: (p^{nu_p(b)} < 10) for all primes (p). This is derived from the fact that there are at most (frac{5n}{p^{nu_p(b)}}) integers divisible by (p^{nu_p(b)}) among (2n) integers.

If (frac{a}{b} in mathbb{N}), then (b = 1) is not possible because it would imply:    [    frac{a_i}{b_i} = frac{p + zq(i-1)}{q}    ]    where (gcd(p, q) = 1). This would lead to a contradiction for (n geq 24). 8. **Bounding (b)**: Using the fact that (b > 10) and (b leq 420), we can conclude that (b in {360, 420}). However, for these values, (n leq bphi(b)(phi(b)-5) < 2018), which is a contradiction. 9. **Case (b = 12)**: If (b = 12), then:    [    frac{a_{12t+i}}{b_{12t+i}} = frac{t_i + a(t-1)d}{d}    ]    and:    [    frac{a_{12t+j}}{b_{12t+j}} = frac{t_j + a(t-1)d}{d}    ]    leading to a contradiction as shown in the detailed proof.

We'll model the situation using a directed graph where: - Each vertex represents a tennis player. - Each directed edge from vertex ( u ) to vertex ( v ) indicates that player ( u ) defeated player ( v ). Since the tournament is a round-robin, every player plays with every other player exactly once. Therefore, our graph is a complete directed graph with 14 vertices. 1. **Selecting three players:**    Consider any subset of three players from the total 14 players. Let's denote these players by ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). We're required to show that for any set of 11 remaining players, each one of them has lost to at least one of ( A ), ( B ), or ( C ). 2. **Counting the edges:**    By Pigeonhole Principle, in a completed directed graph of 14 vertices, each vertex has 13 edges directed towards it (out-degree) and 13 edges directed away from it (in-degree).     Since there are 14 players ( (n=14) ) and each player has played against every other player exactly once, there are ( binom{14}{2} = 91 ) matches (or directed edges). 3. **Total wins and losses:**    Each player either wins or loses against another player, hence for any particular set of 3 players, each other player will have:    - Either lost to at least one of the three players.    - Or won against one or more of the three players. 4. **Enumerating scenarios:**    Consider that each of the 3 selected players can only lose against another chosen player from the same group. This means the remaining 11 players can spread their losses over these 3 players.    Scenario breakdown:    - When any player outside this group (the remaining 11 players) plays against the group of three, and loses, it contributes directly to fulfilling the condition.    - Any player that does not lose directly to one of these three, due to the single loss rule being deterministic, means that any one of the other two or both would have a direct win-condition established. 5. **Establishing inevitability:**    Given total matches against three must sum up to 33 (since 11 ( times ) 3), and each subset game ensures a deterministic win-or-loss combination, we see from combinatorial examination that all such scenarios must have at least 1 loss for each player from the remaining set when examined against the 3.    Hence for any selected trio ( P, Q, R ), we derive that the independence of losing status is not viable without at least one established loss per examined remaining player, thus proving that every one of the 11 players must have lost to at least one of the triangle's members, ( (text{P})triangle(text{Q})triangle(text{R}) ). # Conclusion: Thus, there indeed exists a set of three players such that each of the other 11 players has lost to at least one among those three players.

Since the booth made three times as much selling cotton candy, the amount made from cotton candy each day would be 3P. The total earnings for 5 days from popcorn would be 5P, and from cotton candy would be 15P. The sum of these earnings is the total revenue before expenses, which is 5P + 15P = 20P. The booth has to pay 30 for rent and 75 for the cost of ingredients, which is a total expense of 30 + 75 = 105. The booth earned 895 after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients, so the total revenue before expenses was 895 + 105 = 1000.

The asymptotes of a hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 are given by y=pmfrac{b}{a}x. In this case, since a=1, the asymptotes are y=pm bx. 2. Next, we find the intersection points of these asymptotes with the circle x^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1. Substituting y=bx into the equation of the circle, we get x^{2}+(bx-2)^{2}=1, which simplifies to (b^{2}+1)x^{2}-4bx+3=0. 3. This is a quadratic equation in x, and the number of intersection points is determined by its discriminant Delta=b^{2}-4(b^{2}+1)(3)=b^{2}-12b^{2}-12=-11b^{2}-12. 4. Since the asymptote intersects the circle at most once, the discriminant must be non-positive, i.e., -11b^{2}-12leq 0. Solving this inequality for b, we get b^{2}geq-frac{12}{11}, but since b > 0, this condition is automatically satisfied. 5. Now, we need to find the eccentricity of the hyperbola. The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is given by e=sqrt{1+frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}}. In this case, a=1, so e=sqrt{1+b^{2}}. 6. From the previous step, we know that b^{2}geq-frac{12}{11}, so e=sqrt{1+b^{2}}geqsqrt{1-frac{12}{11}}=frac{1}{sqrt{11}}. 7. However, none of the given options include eccentricities less than 1. Therefore, the condition b^{2}geq-frac{12}{11} must be too weak, and we need to find a stronger condition. 8. Going back to the discriminant, we notice that it's a decreasing function of b^{2}. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points occurs when b^{2} is minimum. In other words, we need to find the smallest value of b^{2} such that the discriminant is non-positive. 9. Since the discriminant is -11b^{2}-12, the smallest value of b^{2} that makes it non-positive is b^{2}=-frac{12}{11}. However, this value is not acceptable because b > 0. Therefore, we need to find the smallest positive value of b^{2} such that the discriminant is negative. 10. By trial and error, we find that the smallest positive value of b^{2} that makes the discriminant negative is b^{2}=1.

Assume that a straight line l forms equal angles with each of these three straight lines. 2. By definition, l forms equal angles with l_1, l_2, and l_3. Hence, if we denote these angles by theta, we have:    [    angle(l, l_1) = angle(l, l_2) = angle(l, l_3) = theta.    ] 3. To show that l is perpendicular to another plane Pi_2, implying that l is perpendicular to Pi, we will use the property that if a line is perpendicular to a plane, it is perpendicular to every line in that plane. 4. First, project l onto the plane Pi. Let this projection be l'. Since l forms equal angles with l_1, l_2, and l_3, the projection l' must be along the angle bisector of the angles formed by l_1 and l_2, l_1 and l_3, and l_2 and l_3. 5. However, since l_1, l_2, and l_3 all intersect at O, the only possibility for l' to be consistent with all the given equal angles is for l' to be along the line through O perpendicular to Pi. Otherwise, l' would not be able to form equal angles with three intersecting lines in the plane Pi. 6. Thus, the projection of l on the plane Pi being consistent means that l' must be a unique direction perpendicular to Pi. 7. Therefore, l itself must be perpendicular to the plane Pi.

For ( a = 2020 @ 4 ), we have: ( a = 2020 times 2021 times 2022 times 2023 ) For ( b = 2120 @ 4 ), we have: ( b = 2120 times 2121 times 2122 times 2123 ) Now, to find the ratio ( frac{a}{b} ), we divide ( a ) by ( b ): ( e = frac{a}{b} = frac{2020 times 2021 times 2022 times 2023}{2120 times 2121 times 2122 times 2123} ) To simplify this, we can cancel out common factors or use properties of ratios. However, in this case, there are no common factors between the numerators and denominators. Therefore, we need to calculate the values of ( a ) and ( b ) and then divide them.

If we expand: [ (a + b + c + d)(a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3) - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^2 = 0, ] it simplifies to a similar identity as in the original problem: [ ab(a - b)^2 + ac(a - c)^2 + ad(a - d)^2 + bc(b - c)^2 + bd(b - d)^2 + cd(c - d)^2 = 0. ] Again, since a, b, c, d are all nonnegative, each term must equal zero, leading to similar implications: for any two variables among a, b, c, d, either one is zero, or they are equal. Therefore, each variable can be either zero or a positive number with all positive values being equal. Given (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 9), we know not all values can be zero. Counting all combinations, we have (2^4 = 16) possible sets of values. Subtracting the one case where all are zero, we get 16 - 1 = 15 valid combinations. For each, if we set three variables to zero and one positive, that positive variable squared must equal 9, so it equals 3.

Since a truck's tank is 120% bigger than a mini-van's tank, we need to find out how many liters that is: 120% of 65 liters = 1.2 * 65 liters 120% of 65 liters = 78 liters So, a truck's tank holds 78 liters more than a mini-van's tank. Therefore, the total capacity of a truck's tank is: Total capacity of a truck's tank = 65 liters + 78 liters Total capacity of a truck's tank = 143 liters Now, let's calculate the cost of fuel for one truck: Cost of fuel for one truck = 143 liters * 0.70/liter Cost of fuel for one truck = 100.10 Next, let's calculate the total service cost for all vehicles: Total service cost = (2.20/vehicle) * (4 mini-vans + 2 trucks) Total service cost = 2.20 * 6 Total service cost = 13.20 Now, let's calculate the total fuel cost for all mini-vans: Total fuel cost for mini-vans = 45.50/mini-van * 4 mini-vans Total fuel cost for mini-vans = 182.00 And the total fuel cost for all trucks: Total fuel cost for trucks = 100.10/truck * 2 trucks Total fuel cost for trucks = 200.20 Finally, let's calculate the total cost for filling up all vehicles: Total cost = Total service cost + Total fuel cost for mini-vans + Total fuel cost for trucks Total cost = 13.20 + 182.00 + 200.20 Total cost = 395.40 Therefore, the total cost for filling up 4 mini-vans and 2 trucks is boxed{395.40} ."},{"instruction":"Six positive integers are written on the faces of a cube.

Therefore, we can rewrite b as: [ b = log_{5}3 = log_{5}sqrt[3]{27} ] Now, comparing sqrt[3]{27} with sqrt[3]{25}, since 27 > 25, we know that sqrt[3]{27} > sqrt[3]{25}. Thus, we can say: [ log_{5}sqrt[3]{27} > log_{5}sqrt[3]{25} = frac{2}{3} ] So, we have: [ b > frac{2}{3} ] **Step 3: Conclusion** Given c=frac{2}{3}, and from our analysis above, we have established that: [ a < frac{2}{3} < b ] Therefore, the correct order is a < c < b.

The first step triples the remainder, while the second step does not change it. If repeatedly tripling a number modulo 15 does not yield 18 equiv 3, the number 18 cannot appear in the sequence. Moreover, if a term is congruent to 3 modulo 15, it must be 3, 18, or a number more than 30. If it's 3, after one step 18 will be in the sequence. If it's 18, then 18 is already in the sequence. If it's greater than 30, subtracting 15 repeatedly will eventually lead to 18, the largest number less than 30 that is congruent to 3 modulo 15. We need to find which remainders modulo 15 will eventually give 3 when tripled modulo 15 repeatedly. We can see that 1 and 5 give 3 modulo 15 eventually. We can also see that 0, 6, 9, and 12 (i.e., multiples of 3) will end up at 0 when tripled modulo 15, and so they will not reach 3 modulo 15. This leaves 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14.

There are 12 smaller cubes painted on only 2 faces. How many smaller cubes were created in total?","output":"If there are 12 smaller cubes painted on only 2 faces, these cubes must come from the edges of the original cube, excluding the corners. Each edge of the original cube will contribute one smaller cube that has exactly two faces painted. A cube has 12 edges, so if there are 12 smaller cubes with two faces painted, it means that the original cube was cut into smaller cubes such that there is only one smaller cube per edge. This implies that the original cube was cut into smaller cubes that are one layer deep along each edge. Since each edge contributes one smaller cube with two painted faces, and there are no smaller cubes from the corners (which would have three painted faces) or from the center of the faces (which would have one painted face) mentioned, we can deduce that the original cube was cut into a 3 x 3 x 3 grid of smaller cubes. This is because each face of the cube would have a center piece (unpainted or with one painted face), four edge pieces (with two painted faces), and four corner pieces (with three painted faces).

We need to find a number n that shares exactly three common divisors with 120, and these divisors must follow the form of 1, q, and q^2, where q is prime. Since 120 contains the factors 2, 3, and 5, the only way for 120 and n to share exactly three divisors, including 1, is by ensuring that n includes a square of one of these primes but no higher powers or other primes that would introduce more divisors. Let’s select 2^2, whose values are 1, 2, and 4. In this scenario, n attracts a constraint: besides being divisible by 4, it should not include any additional factors from primes in 120's factorization at higher powers than necessary.  Examining that n = 2^2 cdot k, where k ensures no additional divisors arise from the other primes in 120, let’s simply set k = 1; thus, n = 4. Divisors of 4: 1, 2, 4 Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 4, ...

First, we note that as an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x), and since the domain of f(x) is mathbb{R} (all real numbers), it is guaranteed that f(0) = 0 because odd functions are symmetric about the origin. Given that a+b < 0, we want to determine the truth of the given statements based on the properties of the function: 1. **Analysis of Option A**: f(a+b) > 0    Since a+b < 0, and knowing that f(0) = 0, for a decreasing function, if the input is less than 0, the output will be greater than f(0), because the function values decrease as x increases.

Since a < -b, and given f is a decreasing function, f(a) > f(-b) because in a decreasing function, a smaller input leads to a larger output. Using the property of odd functions, f(-b) = -f(b).
