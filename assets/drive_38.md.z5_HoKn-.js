Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am...

Write highlights for this article: Benefit claimants are being asked only. to make ‘some of the same choices working families have to make every. day’, George Osborne insisted yesterday. Accusing his critics of talking. ‘ill-informed rubbish’, the Chancellor said most voters understood the. need to change a welfare system that Labour allowed to spiral so far out. of control it cost one pound in every six paid in tax by workers. He said the Government’s reforms,. including a cap to ensure no one on benefits can get more than the. average working family, were restoring ‘common sense and control’. Scroll down for video. Chancellor George Osborne defended changes to the benefits system which he said were designed to back people who work hard and want to get on. Mr Osborne sought to present a more populist image, addressing workers at the Morrisons supermarket distribution centre in Sittingbourne, Kent. He conceded the shake-up would mean. welfare claimants having to make choices such as living in a ‘less. expensive house, to live in a house without a spare bedroom unless they. can afford it, to get by on the average family income’. But he insisted: ‘These are the. realities of life for working people. They should be the reality for. everyone else too. I’m proud of what we’re doing.’ Speaking at a supermarket distribution. centre in Kent, the Chancellor warned those opposing the Government’s. reforms they were ‘out of touch’ with ordinary families whose taxes paid. for the benefits system. In 2010, when Labour left power, payments to working age families cost a staggering £90billion, the Chancellor said. Mr Osborne suggested his approach to welfare cuts was inspired by the Morrison slogan. Mug's game: The Chancellor drank tea with staff at the site, as he argued that capping benefits was fair for those who worked and paid taxes. ‘That means about one in every six. pounds of tax working people like you pay was going on working age. benefits. To put that into perspective – that’s more than we spend on. our schools,’ he added. ‘For too long, we’ve had a system. where people who did the right thing – who get up in the morning and. work hard – felt penalised for it, while people who did the wrong thing. got rewarded for it.’ George Osborne's hopes of avoiding an unprecedented triple dip recession are on a knife-edge. The British Chamber of Commerce yesterday predicted that the economy grew from January to March, averting the devastating second consecutive quarter of decline would have officially returned the UK to recession. Export deliveries and orders from the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of UK economic output - rose close to the all-time highs seen in 1994 during the first three months of 2013, the BCC said. John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: 'We should not be satisfied with a long and tortuous road to recovery. These results provide a glimpse of the as-yet-distant sunlit uplands of recovery - businesses up and down the country are working hard to drive the economy, create jobs and export, but they cannot accelerate this process alone.' However, fears of a triple dip recession were fuelled by new figures which suggested Britain's manufacturing sector contracted in the first quarter following another month of sliding output. The sector's 'winter of discontent' continued into March as overall activity slumped for the second month in a row, with a worse-than-expected headline reading of 48.3 - below the 50 level which separates growth from contraction, the latest Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) revealed. The Chancellor was scathing about the. ‘vested interests’ who complained with ‘depressingly predictable. outrage’ about every change. ‘In recent days we have heard a lot of,. frankly, ill-informed rubbish about these welfare reforms,’ he said in. response to criticism from Labour, charities and some church leaders. ‘Some have said it’s the end of the. welfare state. That is shrill, headline-seeking nonsense. I will tell. you what is true. Taxpayers don’t think the welfare state works properly. any more.’ Mr Osborne said the Government had to. act to reform a system that was ‘fundamentally broken’, leaving people. better off on the dole than if they went out to work. ‘Defending benefits that trap people in poverty and penalise work is defending the indefensible,’ he said. A raft of changes comes into force. this month, including a £500-a-week cap on household benefits and an. average £14-a-week cut in housing benefit for council tenants who insist. on a spare room. The first trials will be held of a. universal credit, which replaces the main out-of-work benefits and is. designed to ensure it always pays to take a job or work more hours. For Labour, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. insisted: ‘The benefits bill is rising under this Government because. our economy is flatlining, inflation is rising and unemployment is high. ‘The best way to get the benefits bill down is to get our economy growing strongly and get people back to work.’ Anne Marie Carrie, head of the. children’s charity Barnardo’s, appealed to ministers to ditch a 1 per. cent cap on benefit increases, which is well below the rate of. inflation. Disability living allowance is being replaced by a personal independence payment. Mr Osborne said that for too long people who work were penalised to fund handouts for the jobless. Before delivering his speech on benefit changes, Mr Osborne unveiled a plague to officially open new City watchdog, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), as the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King, second left, and Andrew Bailey, left, the Chief Executive of the PRA, look on.","output":"Chancellor George Osborne has defended changes to the benefits system, arguing that they were designed to support people who work hard and strive to progress.

Here is a news article: But Justice Kennedy said the Constitution gave the president exclusive authority to determine the nation’s stance. “Put simply,” he wrote, “the nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not.”      The nation must speak with one voice, he said, and “that voice must be the president’s.”      In dissent, Chief Justice Roberts said the majority had taken a bold step. “Today’s decision is a first,” he wrote. “Never before has this court accepted a president’s direct defiance of an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs.”      The case concerned a 2002 law that instructed the State Department to “record the place of birth as Israel” in the passports of American children born in Jerusalem if their parents requested the designation. The law was meant to take a symbolic stand on the status of Jerusalem, which has long divided not only Israelis and Arabs but also Congress and presidents of both parties.      But the executive branch’s policy since Harry Truman’s presidency “has been to recognize no state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem, leaving the issue to be decided by negotiation between the parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute,” the Obama administration said in a brief in the case.      The case, Zivotofsky v. Kerry, No. 13-628, was brought by the parents of Menachem B. Zivotofsky, who was born not long after Congress enacted the law. Under the State Department’s policies, their son’s passport says that he was born in Jerusalem. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE The Supreme Court declined Monday to insert itself into the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by second-guessing U.S. policy on Jerusalem. USA TODAY      Menachem Zivotofsky's passport case has dragged on for more than a decade. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP)      WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court declined Monday to insert itself into the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by second-guessing U.S. policy on Jerusalem.      Ruling just a few months after a feud between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the justices refused to allow Americans born in Jerusalem to have their passports changed to reflect Israel as their birthplace, as Congress demanded more than a decade ago.      In denying the challenge waged by the Jewish parents of a 12-year-old almost since his birth in 2002, a majority of justices heeded the State Department's warning that a simple passport alteration could \\"provoke uproar throughout the Arab and Muslim world.\\"      Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the 6-3 decision for the court, which needed more than seven months following oral arguments in early November to decide the congressional law was unconstitutional. It was the longest-pending high court decision.      \\"The power to recognize or decline to recognize a foreign state and its territorial bounds resides in the president alone,\\" Kennedy said, citing examples from the French Revolution in 1793 to President Jimmy Carter's recognition of the People's Republic of China in 1979.      \\"Recognition is an act with immediate and powerful significance for international relations, so the president's position must be clear. Congress cannot require him to contradict his own statement regarding a determination of formal recognition.\\"      Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito dissented. They sided with Congress, which passed a law in 2002 allowing Americans born in Jerusalem to have Israel listed as their place of birth on their passports.      \\"Today's decision is a first,\\" Roberts said. \\"Never before has this court accepted a president's direct defiance of an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs.\\" He said the court was bowing to fears that the congressional law could be misinterpreted as changing U.S. foreign policy, rather than allowing citizens to define their place of birth.      Justice Clarence Thomas took a middle ground, agreeing that Congress cannot circumvent the president on passports, but arguing that the law can be applied to consular reports of birth abroad.      The status of Jerusalem has been at the top of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ever since Israel was recognized in 1948. The official U.S. policy is spelled out in a State Department manual: \\"For a person born in Jerusalem, write JERUSALEM as the place of birth in the passport. Do not write Israel, Jordan or West Bank.\\"      President George W. Bush signed a massive foreign relations law in 2002 that included a section stating that for Americans born in Jerusalem, \\"the secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen's legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\\" However, Bush indicated he would ignore that provision as unconstitutional, and the Obama administration agrees.      The parents of young Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky began their legal battle later that year. Had they won, it could have led to a long line of other Jerusalem natives seeking to change their passports; about 50,000 U.S. citizens were born there.      But a majority of justices sided with U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who warned in November that a ruling for the Zivotofskys would undermine the president's authority to set policy for \\"the most vexing and volatile and difficult diplomatic issue that this country has faced for decades.\\"      While acknowledging that the Supreme Court plays no role in foreign affairs other than resolving cases like this one, Kennedy clearly expressed an opinion for the court's majority. \\"Put simply, the nation must have a single policy regarding which governments are legitimate in the eyes of the United States and which are not,\\" he wrote.      The court's four liberal members — including its only three Jews — sided with the administration from the outset. During oral arguments, Justice Elena Kagan called the congressional act \\"a very selective vanity-plate law,\\" intimating it would not do the same if Palestinians born in Jerusalem wanted their passports to say \\"Palestine.\\"      But Scalia chided the State Department at the time for wanting to \\"make nice with the Palestinians.\\" In his dissent, he said the balance of power issue between the president and Congress is far more important than Zivotofsky's passport and that of others born in Jerusalem.      \\"The text and structure of the Constitution divide responsibility for foreign policy, like responsibility for just about everything else, between the two coordinate, equal political branches,\\" he said from the bench. \\"A principle that the nation must have a single foreign policy, which elevates efficiency above the test and structure of the Constitution, will systematically favor the president at the expense of Congress.\\"      While most of the focus has been on Middle East policy, the court's ruling also was important in answering a question never before resolved in the nation's history: Which branch of government gets to recognize foreign countries?      The Zivotofskys' supporters, including most major Jewish groups, contended that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that Congress, not the president, has the upper hand when it comes to immigration, naturalization and passport policies.      The administration's supporters said Jerusalem is the most delicate issue in the world's most intractable dispute, and that only presidents have the power to recognize sovereign nations. Arab groups have lined up on that side of the debate.      During oral arguments, Kennedy had suggested a compromise in which passports listing Israel as the holder's birthplace would specify that they did not represent a change in U.S. foreign policy.      That compromise did not materialize. Instead, the court produced 89 pages of opinions, concurrences and dissents that gave the president a significant victory at the expense of Congress.

But what about his girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo, sanpro and moisturiser, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is any missing? Has any been bought? In the bedroom, has the shared bed been made or not? Are her clothes being used and exchanged for clean ones? Is the laundry basket fuller? In the toilet, is the seat up or down? I mean, good grief! And to cap it all Paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend is still living at home. Why doesn't he just phone her? But it gets worse. In the last act although no-one told Vincent where the rest of the group are going he manages to find them. Lenny's love interest and Sean's girlfriend conveniently appear to be best friends and also manage to find the group.

Answer the following question: Jerry and George are two roommates who have lived together since college. They have always gotten along well, have similar hobbies and even are the same height. They both enjoy watching sports and playing videogames, but Jerry also rides his bike several miles each week. George can't stand exercising. Instead, he prefers to lay around relaxing and driving his car if he needs to go somewhere.  Who has a higher risk of hypertension? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, George has a higher risk of hypertension.  Step 1: Analyze the Lifestyle Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can be influenced by lifestyle factors. Among these, physical activity plays a crucial part. Regular exercise helps keep your heart and blood vessels healthy, reducing the risk of hypertension. Jerry, who rides his bike for several miles each week, seems to have a healthy exercise regimen which could help him to lower the risk of hypertension.  Step 2: Understanding Habits On the other hand, George prefers to relax and leans more into sedentary activities. He opts to drive instead of indulging in any form of physical activities. Sedentary lifestyle is one of the factors that could increase the risk of hypertension. Step 3: Conclusion  While we cannot conclusively determine someone's health status without clinical information, given the circumstances, it is reasonable to state that George, with his more sedentary lifestyle, is at a higher risk of developing hypertension compared to Jerry. This is due to his lack of exercise which is known to increase the risk of hypertension.

There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), steps down as Queen. During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine). During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by Parliament member Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is Nicholas. Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) surprises her by visiting. Together, they pick through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue), Duke of Kenilworth and days later they are engaged. Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement. For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle but does not know how.

So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them. Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh.

Sentence 1: \\"you know yeah that's it that's all that's that the to let the world know that we could do what we say we was going to that's about it.\\" This sentence is somewhat unclear and fragmented, but the key ideas it expresses seem to be: 1.

Sentence 2: \\"Only reason we did it, was to let the world know we are negotiable and don't always do what we say.\\" This sentence more clearly conveys the following ideas: 1. The primary intention (or \\"only reason\\") is to let the world know about something. 2. The focus is on showing that they are flexible (negotiable) and don't always stick to their initial statements or plans. While both sentences emphasize the importance of conveying a message to the world, the key difference lies in the nature of that message. Sentence 1 refers to proving one's ability to follow through on stated plans, whereas Sentence 2 highlights the idea of being open to negotiation and not necessarily beholden to their initial statements or plans.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly The answer is:","output":"The final step of the process detailed above is the eruption of a volcano. Once the pressure buildup beneath the Earth's surface becomes intense enough due to the accumulation of gases, the molten magma is forced to break through the Earth's crust and erupt from the volcano. To describe the final step in detail, let us break down the process leading up to the volcanic eruption: 1. Gases, primarily composed of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are trapped within the Earth's mantle in the form of dissolved volatiles in the magma. The increasing accumulation of these gases, along with the migration of mantle-derived magma to shallower depths, results in rising pressure beneath the Earth's surface. 2. As pressure continues to build up, the magma, which is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, starts to rise toward the surface. The gases dissolved in the magma begin to expand due to the reduction in pressure as the magma ascends. 3. The magma eventually reaches the Earth's surface, where it becomes lava upon contact with the atmosphere. At this stage, the pressure from the expanding gases causes fractures to form in the Earth's crust, resulting in the creation of fissures or openings that allow the molten lava to flow out. 4. The lava then begins to cool and solidify upon contact with the cooler ground and air. This solidified lava forms characteristic volcanic rock formations, such as basalt and andesite. Over time, repeated eruptions and cooling processes cause layers of solidified lava to accumulate around the vent, creating a volcanic cone. 5. The cycle of pressure buildup and cooling continues, with each new magma intrusion contributing to the growth and expansion of the volcanic cone. As the pressure increases significantly, the force exerted by the gases and magma causes the surrounding rock to become unstable and results in a more explosive volcanic eruption. The final step of this process, the eruption of a volcano, is characterized by a sudden release of accumulated gas pressure and the expulsion of lava, ash, and volcanic rock fragments from the vent. The explosive force of the eruption can cause the collapse of the volcanic cone, forming a central crater or caldera. Additionally, volcanic eruptions can generate secondary hazards, such as lahars, pyroclastic flows, and volcanic gas emissions, which can have profound consequences for the surrounding environment and communities."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What are the major languages in italy?

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Jazz fusion (also known as jazz-rock) is a musical genre that developed in the late 1960s when musicians combined aspects of jazz harmony and improvisation with styles such as funk, rock, rhythm and blues, and Latin jazz. During this time many jazz musicians began experimenting with electric instruments and amplified sound for the first time, as well as electronic effects and synthesizers. Many of the developments during the late 1960s and early 1970s have since become established elements of jazz fusion musical practice.  - The Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices was awarded from 1977 to 1986. From 1977 to 1981 it was called the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement for Voices. The award is presented to the arranger of the music.  - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\".  - A cappella (Italian for \\"in the manner of the chapel\\") music is specifically group or solo singing without instrumental accompaniment, or a piece intended to be performed in this way. It contrasts with cantata, which is accompanied singing. The term \\"a cappella\\" was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato style. In the 19th century a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music. The term is also used, albeit rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.  - Janis Siegel (born July 23, 1952) is an American jazz singer with the vocal group The Manhattan Transfer.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - m-pact is a Los Angeles, California-based \\"pop-jazz vocal group\\" founded in June 1995. It is most notable for winning the Los Angeles Music Award for Vocal Group of the Year, as well as the 1999 Billboard \\"Unsigned Band of the Year\\" award.  - Weather Report was an American jazz fusion band of the 1970s and early 1980s. The band was initially co-led by the Austrian-born keyboard player Joe Zawinul, the American saxophonist Wayne Shorter and Czech bassist Miroslav Vitouš. Due to creative and financial disagreements Vitouš left the band after a few years. Zawinul took increasing control and steered the band towards a more funk, R&B oriented sound. Other prominent members at various points in the band's lifespan included bassists Alphonso Johnson, Jaco Pastorius and Victor Bailey; and drummers/percussionists Peter Erskine, Alex Acuña, Airto Moreira and Chester Thompson.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures).  - The Manhattan Transfer is an American a cappella, jazz fusion/pop music group founded in 1969 in New York City and still active in the 2010s.

Article: Figure out the length of your braid. Add on an extra 1/3 of that measurement to get your cutting length. This is how long you'll need to cut your string. For example:  Desired length: 24 inches (61 cm) 24 divided by 3 = 8 inches (20 cm) 24 + 8 = 32 inches (81 cm) 32 inches (81 cm) = cutting length Use the same color for each strand of string, or use different colors. For a fancier braid, cut 6 or 9 strings instead, then divide them into 3 groups. For example, you can do 3 pink strings, 3 purple strings, and 3 magenta strings. Embroidery floss is a popular choice, but you can use other types of string, such as yarn or leather cording. Gather the ends of your strings together. Treating them as a single strand, coil them into a loop, then pull the ends through the loop. This will make the knot. Keep the knot 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the string end. Tape the string above the knot to a flat surface, such as a table. 1 strand to the left, 1 in the middle, and 1 on the right. With multiple strands of color, group the strands by color instead. For example, place the pink strings to the left, the purple strings in the middle, and all the magenta strings to the right. Take the left string and cross it over the middle string. Take the right string and cross it over the new middle string. Again, if you have multiple strings of each color, treat that color group as a single string. For example, if you have 3 pink, 3 purple, and 3 magenta strings, cross all of the pink strings over all of the purple strings. Give the strings a gentle tug to tighten the strings as you braid. Repeat the process until you reach  the length you want, or until you have 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) left. Coil the braid end into a loop, then pull the tails through the loop. Tug on the tails to tighten the knot, then trim off the left over strands, You can now use the braid for the craft project you created it for.

Sixteen years ago I learned a lesson. I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane   when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes  , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just 3cm from the back of the other car. I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started shouting at us. I couldn't believe it! My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said, \\"Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!\\" And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, \\"The Law of the Garbage Truck\\". He said, \\"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger and disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump   it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you. So I started thinking how often I let Garbage Trucks run right over me and how often I take their garbage and spread it to other people. I began to see Garbage Trucks. I see _ people are carrying. I see them coming to dump it. And like my taxi driver, I don't take it personally. I just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. How did the author learn to deal with Garbage Trucks? A) Fight back immediately. B) Call the police for help. C) Smile and move on. D) Dump it on someone else. Answer:","output":"C) Smile and move on. The author learned to deal with Garbage Trucks by adopting the perspective and approach of their taxi driver. When faced with people who are full of anger, frustration, or disappointment, the author chooses not to take it personally. Instead, they follow the taxi driver's example of smiling, waving, wishing them well, and moving on without allowing the negativity to affect their own mood. By doing this, the author effectively prevents others from dumping their emotional garbage onto them and avoids spreading that negativity to the people they interact with. This approach fosters a more positive mindset and encourages a healthier emotional environment for the author and those around them. The Law of the Garbage Truck serves as a valuable lesson on how to maintain one's own emotional well-being and balance when faced with challenging situations and interactions with difficult people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

McClane finally arrives just in time to prevent Farrell from being killed by assassins working for Mai Linh (Maggie Q), a mysterious cyber-terrorist who works for her boss and love interest, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant). En route to Washington, D.C. with McClane, Farrell reveals that he received a large sum of money from Mai to write an algorithm that can crack a security system. As McClane and Farrell arrive in Washington, Gabriel orders his own crew of hackers to take control of the transportation grids and stock market, while nationally broadcasting a message threatening the United States.

Entailment occurs when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another sentence. In simpler terms, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. Entailment can be identified by carefully examining the contents of both sentences and determining whether the truth of one implies the truth of the other. Considering the given sentences, we can break down the information provided by each sentence: Sentence 1: - There are four items being referred to. - One of these items is a fragment of some dark green fabric. - This dark green fabric fragment contains only a thread or two. - Although small, this fragment is recognizable. Sentence 2: - There is a fragment of dark green fabric. By examining the contents of both sentences, we can observe that Sentence 2 provides a statement that is a subset of the information provided in Sentence 1. Sentence 1 clearly states the existence of a dark green fabric fragment with only a thread or two while Sentence 2 simply acknowledges the presence of a dark green fabric fragment. Since the information presented in Sentence 2 is encompassed in Sentence 1, it can be concluded that Sentence 2 is indeed entailed by Sentence 1.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.

Q:Sand mining in the north coastal region was stopped 20 years ago, but it still continues to this day in the south region.

The southern beach had erosion problems as well. The northern beach recovered, and is suitable for tourism.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which region has a less coral riffs?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] A:","output":"Based on the information provided, the southern region likely has fewer coral reefs compared to the northern region. This is because sand mining, which is still ongoing in the southern region, causes erosion and increases water turbidity, negatively impacting marine wildlife like corals that require sunlight. Moreover, the southern region has experienced scarcity in fish and other marine wildlife, indicating a potential decrease in coral reefs' health and abundance.

Eddie's friend and co-worker, Nick (Fred Williamson), and two other co-workers, Burke and Ramon, have formed a secret vigilante group because Nick and the group are fed up with the crime in their neighborhoods. Nick and his group are also tired of the police, because the police always fail to protect people. Nick's \\"group\\" has support of various residents of the neighborhood who indirectly help them. In one example, a local thug stalks and chases a young woman to a rooftop of an apartment building where the thug robs and then kills her. An old lady who witnesses the thug says nothing to the police, but points out the thug to Nick and his group the next day. Nick and his friends forcibly grab the thug off the streets and place him in their van and drive away. The thug is later found dead in a vacant lot with all of his arms and legs broken and his head bashed in. One evening, Eddie returns home from work only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed, and Scott has been shot dead in a home invasion which was in retaliation for Vicki aiding a gas station attendant who was being assaulted earlier. Frederico \\"Rico\\" Melendez (Willie ColÃ³n), the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang, is arrested for the crime. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher (Carol Lynley) seeks a lengthy jail sentence, since New York does not have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick's lack of faith in the system is proven correct when Rico is set free after his right-hand man, Prago (Don Blakely), bribes both Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) and Eisenburg (Joe Spinell), Rico's attorney.

Plot title: Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home Movie plot: In 2286, a large cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of ships it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth. On the planet Vulcan, the former officers of the USS Enterprise are living in exile (after the events of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock). Accompanied by the Vulcan Spock, still recovering from his resurrection, the crewâexcept for Saavik, who remains on Vulcanâtake their captured Klingon Bird-of-Prey starship (nicknamed the Bounty, after the Royal Navy ship) and head to Earth to face trial for their theft and destruction of Enterprise. Hearing Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the song of extinct humpback whales, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to travel back in time via a slingshot maneuver around the Sun, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal. Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its cloaking device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored. Kirk and Spock discover a pair of whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a Sausalito museum, and learn they will soon be released into the wild.

Garajonay National Park covers approximately 40 square kilometers (15 square miles) and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is characterized by its lush laurel forest, known as \\"laurisilva,\\" which is a unique and rare vegetation type that dates back to the Tertiary period and is typically found in the Canaries and Azores. This dense, subtropical forest provides a habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, some of which are endemic to the region. Monfragüe National Park is located in the western-central region of Spain, specifically in the province of Cáceres within the Extremadura community. The park occupies an area of approximately 180 square kilometers (70 square miles) and is positioned along the banks of the Tagus and Tiétar rivers. Monfragüe is known for its spectacular landscapes consisting of Mediterranean forests, cliffs, and reservoirs. One of the most emblematic features of the park is the Peña Falcon, a massive rock face that rises above the rivers and serves as a nesting site for various birds, including the endangered Spanish imperial eagle and the Eurasian black vulture.

Writing in 1952, after the first section of the buildings was complete, J. M. Richards, the editor of the Architectural Review, said that Nuffield was \\"a large-scale example of period-style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind\\". As the site was away from the \\"ancient colleges\\" of the city centre and in an area of \\"undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building\\", there had been a \\"rare opportunity\\" of building something \\"belonging ... to the twentieth century, and of showing that Oxford does not live only in the past\\". He said that the \\"compromise between contemporary needs and what is imagined to be the English collegiate tradition is quite unworthy of the educational enterprise the new foundation represents\\". He was, however, \\"thankful\\" that the building used smooth-faced stone \\"in the proper Oxford style\\" rather than rubble facing, which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford \\"with extraordinarily unpleasing results\\".The architectural correspondent of The Times wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous – it was \\"remarkable\\" that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way.  \\"That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up [in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house] has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford.\\" Writing in The Observer, Patience Gray also disliked the college's design, referring to the \\"Cotswold dementia\\" of the architecture, and the college's \\"pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower.\\" The chapel was described by the travel writer Jan Morris as \\"one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford\\"; \\"very simple, almost stern\\" with a contrast between the black and white pews and the \\"rich colour\\" of the stained glass.

Write highlights for this article: Dr Carl Djerassi, the chemist who developed the birth control pill, died aged 91 on Friday. Girls today take it for granted. A rite of passage into adulthood, a hygienic routine, almost a human right. For the great majority, the modern low-dose oral contraceptive arouses little wonder, creates no health anxieties and raises no eyebrows (unless the taker is scandalously far below the age of consent). The Catholic Church still forbids it and some stay faithful to that rule, but as one Irish friend observed ironically: 'It's astonishing how often the Good Lord sends us Catholic families just two babies.' The Pill, in short, is no longer a marvel. Few women who take the Pill, until reports of his death last Friday at the age of 91, would have known that this can largely be credited to one man, the chemist Carl Djerassi. He arrived in the U.S. as a penniless refugee from Nazi-occupied Vienna, and was himself a virgin when he married at 19. In later years, after his invention, he reflected that — without meaning to — he had sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution: not to mention a financial splash as his pharmaceutical company broke records on Wall Street. This major breakthrough in human development, as so often happens, was an accident. In 1951, he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen — mimicking the female sex hormone known as 'nature's contraceptive' and so preventing ovulation. No egg released, no pregnancy. The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure (I knew one woman who nearly died). Gradually, synthetic oestrogen was added and refinements produced the low-dose combined pills of today. It was in 1960 that Britain got the Pill: it was hailed as a breakthrough, not for general sexual liberation but for domestic and family harmony. Pregnancies now could be spaced out and planned for. The Pill sparked a social, as well as a scientific, revolution and it was hailed as a breakthrough for domestic and family harmony. The old latex contraceptive barriers could be discarded with relief, though a few women mistrusted chemicals and stayed with the good old diaphragm. Initially, the Pill was used only by married women. It wasn't until 1964 that clinics and doctors agreed to prescribe it for single women and young girls. And even a few years later, when I got my first prescription, the family planning clinic was an ordeal. Although some of my 1968 college intake boasted that their mums had 'put them' on the Pill, outside that Chelsea bubble, the truth is that the Swinging Sixties didn't really get going until well into the Seventies. So in a small-town clinic you were still questioned closely about the seriousness of your relationship (it was assumed you had just one) and offered embarrassing advice by a stern nurse. I had one memorably excruciating moment: I disgraced myself in the clinic by clumsily dropping the instructional plastic model of the reproductive system and having to crawl under a table to find a lost fallopian tube. T he next day, after taking my first Pill, I went in to work at the local radio station and my first job was to interview a family planning nurse. The same nurse. We avoided one another's eyes. Djerassi came to understand that he was partly responsible for a sexual revolution: in his book This Man's Pill, he said that the invention made him more interested in how science affects society. Though, he said: 'The explosion was much faster than anyone expected.' The first pills were tough stuff, and takers had side-effects: nausea, weight gain and in some cases there was raised blood pressure. Interestingly, he was fiercely opposed by feminists including Germaine Greer. He recalled some 'unusually bitter exchanges' with her and accepted that some women thought he was to be distrusted as a patriarchal male scientist who was poisoning women with chemicals so men could have their way with them. As for the idea of a male Pill, he memorably said: 'Scientifically, we solved that a number of years ago. But . . . would you, as a woman, put your entire reproductive risk in the trust that he has remembered his Pill?' Good point. And it is the social, psychological consequences we have to reflect on now. Whenever science puts a new tool into the hands of humans — whether it's dynamite, gunpowder, the internet or the Pill — there will be both good and bad ways we use it. The huge benefits of protection from unexpected, unwanted pregnancy are obvious, not only for the young and single. We have lost the stigma of illegitimacy — and good riddance, I am just old enough to remember the era of shame — but even now a missed period can produce heart-shaking horror. A career, a life-plan, a relationship melt before your eyes: the idea of termination is instinctively abhorrent to many, but there is real misery in feeling your body being hijacked, taken over by an uncontrollable alien process you weren't braced for. Before the Pill, remember, that often happened — even to the most instinctively 'moral' girls. We all make mistakes. (Incidentally, Djerassi himself ruefully admitted of his second marriage: 'I, the person who synthesised the first Pill, married another woman because I got her pregnant.' He later had a vasectomy.) But it also became clear that men would take it for granted that women were using the Pill. By the mid-Seventies, the assumption was growing that if a woman wasn't 'fixed up', there was something weird about her. Previously, the risk of pregnancy had at least made it easier for an unwilling girl, even a girl in love, to say 'no' to full sex. It offered a breather, a chance to slow down courtship: 'Is this a lasting treasure, or just a moment's pleasure?' The pressure to 'do it' anyway grew as the Pill became a norm. he was working on an arthritis drug when he discovered a way to make synthetic progestogen, pictured is Dr Djerassi in 1940. I remember being indignantly told it was 'selfish' not to give in to a particular lad, as if women's bodies were a natural resource it was mean to hoard. That's human nature. It is daft to overstate the 'damage to moral fabric' argument. Djerassi himself admitted that the sexual revolution — the separation of sex-for-babies and sex-for-fun — began before his discovery, and would probably have rolled on anyway, though more slowly. But there is no point denying he speeded it up. A nd that alongside the joy and ease and intimacy and happiness of liberated sex, there has been anxiety and unease and a nasty notion — now at least challenged by young feminists — that women's bodies are a commodity for men's convenience, and that sex, that most marvellous of connections, need not involve any intimacy or trust or faith on either side. The Pill has had one other effect, which no one thought about much at the time, but which now ticks like a time-bomb in the heart of every bright professional woman. The phrase 'family planning' and the rarity of surprise-babies nowadays has deceived too many of us into taking it literally. Djerassi predicted a future when his own invention would become redundant, with men and women doing away with the need for contraception altogether by being sterilised — withdrawing their frozen eggs and sperm from a 'bank' when they were ready to have a child via IVF. Already it is easy to assume that we can put off babies until our 40s, or even 50s, and trust science to give nature a hand. But it doesn't always work. The fact is, the ferocious, uncontrollable, youthful fertility which once bred panic does fade, over long years of contraception. And sometimes, it gets too late to have a baby. But these issues aside, may Carl Djerassi rest in peace. On balance, he gave a great thing to womankind and fearless happiness to millions of honest lovers. As with all inventions, it's up to us to use it wisely.

Summarize this article: In a simple substitution cipher, you can assigning letter values to other letters. For example, A may equal C and and F might equal J. Make sure you don’t choose easy combinations like A = B or A = Z. They’ll be easily broken.  Make decoder rings. Those decoder rings you got in a box of cereal years ago may come in handy, but you can make your own too if you want. Write your letters, A through Z, in a large circle. Then, write the substituted letters inside the large circle to form their own smaller circle. Now you’ll have a key for your cipher. Randomize the cipher. Once you’ve got your keys and your friends have theirs too, you can cut out both rings from the paper. Turn the smaller ring inside the larger outer ring to create new substitutions. When you pass your note, write what A equals, and the reader will know where to set their rings. To make a slightly more complicated substitution cipher, you can make your own simple symbols to stand in for letters. The more each symbol looks different than the letter it represents, the harder the code will be to crack. Make sure each symbol is also simple and easy to draw quickly.  Create a key for your new language. Make a master key that shows which letter matches up with each symbol. As you practice writing in your new script, you’ll become more familiar with the symbols, but you’ll need a key at first to remember which is which. Share the key with friends. Your language won’t be of much use if only you can read the notes you pass! Share the key with your friends, advising them to keep it safe so that no one else finds and learns the symbols. Write your messages in the new language. Practice the symbols until you can read and write them as quickly as your native language. It’ll take a while, but you’ll get to know the symbols well over time. For example, swap A with (α) Alpha, B with (β) Beta, C with (Χ) Chi, etc. from the Greek alphabet..  Use similar characters for missing letters. Some foreign alphabets may not contain all the letters in your language. Greek doesn't have Y, but there's a visually similar Upsilon (Y in capitals), so you might use that instead. Make sure your reader knows that you’re going to be substituting some letters for others not in the language. Test some examples.  For example: \\"See you tonight\\" becomes \\"ΣΕΕ ΤΗΟΥ ΤΟΝΙΓΗΤ,” with “you” subbed out for “thou” because Greek doesn’t have a character for “Y”. Numbers tend to stick out in messages with a lot of text, so try to find a better way to to hide them in your cipher. For example, replace the \\"8\\" in \\"See you tonight, 8 o'clock\\" with \\"√(128/2)\\". The 8 is replaced by a simple math: the square root of (128/2=64)=8. It’s relatively easy to crack a substitution code, because you’re still using your native language and only swapping out the letters for other letters or symbols. Words like “and”, “you” and “the”, which will show up frequently in your messages, and can be found out and used to piece together parts of a key. Common letters like E, T and A also help code-breakers to decipher your message. Summary:","output":"A simple substitution cipher involves assigning letter values to other letters, avoiding easy combinations. Decoder rings can help create a key for the cipher, and randomizing the cipher increases security. Make symbols to represent letters and share the key with friends. Some foreign alphabets, like Greek, can be used for substitution but may require adjusting for missing letters. Hide numbers in ciphers through math equations.

It borders Uppsala County and Södermanland County. It also borders Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The city of Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Stockholm County is divided by the historic provinces of Uppland (Roslagen) and Södermanland (Södertörn). More than one fifth of the Swedish population lives in the county. Stockholm County is also one of the statistical \\"riksområden\\" (national areas) according to , Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics within the EU. With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden.  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County.  - Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Rosendals slott ) is a Swedish palace pavilion located at the Djurgården , an island in central Stockholm . It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidströmer , father of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurgården into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - The Baltic Sea (  ; ) is a sea of the Atlantic Ocean, enclosed by Scandinavia, Finland, the Baltic countries, and the North European Plain.

Primarily, calories are used as a source of energy to perform essential tasks, which can be categorized into three main functions: basal metabolism, physical activity, and the thermic effect of food.  1. Basal metabolism: This refers to the energy your body requires to carry out basic functions to survive, such as maintaining body temperature, cell production, and the normal functioning of your organs.   2. Physical activity: Calories are burnt during everyday activities like walking, exercising, and any other body movement. The amount of calories burned varies according to the type and duration of the physical activity. 3. Thermic effect of food: Calories are also used to break down, absorb, and process the food we consume. This is also known as the heat or energy produced during digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients in the body. In case your body consumes more calories than necessary for these three energy needs, the surplus calories are converted into a storage form called fat, which can be utilized in times of energy deficiency. The body can store fat in adipose tissues distributed throughout the body, ensuring a long-term energy reserve for future use when the need arises.

Fignon won the Tour in 1983 and 1984 but was perhaps most famous for the 1989 contest, when he was beaten by Greg Lemond by only eight seconds -- the smallest winning margin in the history of the race. The Frenchman actually held the lead going into the final stage time-trial into Paris, but he let his advantage slip to allow American Lemond to snatch victory in the most dramatic finish ever seen. As well as his two Tour victories, Fignon won nine stages and held the leader's yellow jersey for 22 days. His other big race successes included two wins in the Milan-San Remo one-day classic and two stage wins in both the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta Espana. Fignon was a colorful character on and off the bike, famous for his flowing blond hair and glasses, and was also regarded as an anti-establishment figure. In his autobiography, \\"We Were Young and Carefree\\", Fignon admitted taking amphetamines and cortisone during his career but did not establish a direct link with his cancer. \\"In those days everyone was doing it,\\" he explained in his book. \\"But it is impossible to know to what extent doping harms you. \\"Whether those who lived through 1998, when a lot of extreme things happened, will get cancer after 10 or 20 years, I really can't say.\\" Meanwhile, tributes for Fignon have poured in from the world of cycling. Defending Tour de France champion Alberto Contador led the tributes on his Twitter page, saying: \\"Today we lost a great champion, Laurent Fignon, after a hard struggle. It was a privilege to share some time with him in Paris. Rest in peace. Lance Armstrong, who himself battled cancer before becoming the greatest Tour de France champion of all time, said on his official website:  \\"I awoke today to the terrible news that my dear friend and legendary cyclist Laurent Fignon has passed away. \\"I will never forget the early 90's when I first turned pro, of course terrified of the older guys. Laurent was always a friendly face with words of advice. He was a special man to me, to cycling, and to all of France. Laurent, we will all miss you.\\" And fellow-American Lemond, whose name will always be linked with Fignon after their epic 1989 duel, echoed those sentiments. \\"I will miss Laurent Fignon as a great person and competitor. A truly sad day for everyone whose lives he touched.\\" In later life, Fignon became a consultant for French television and commentated on the Tour de France in 2009 and 2010 despite the treatment he was receiving. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Laurent Fignon, the legendary French cyclist who won the Tour de France in 1983 and 1984, has passed away at the age of 50 due to cancer.

Named after the river by which it is made, 'Dovedale' cheese is produced only in which county????","output":"Dovedale cheese, a distinctive and delectable cheese variety, is produced exclusively in the picturesque county of Derbyshire in England. Named after the stunning River Dove that runs through the Dovedale valley, this cheese has become an important part of the region's culinary culture and an acclaimed example of British artisan cheesemaking. Derbyshire is located in the East Midlands region and is known for its beautiful countryside, rich cultural heritage, and its burgeoning reputation for artisanal food, particularly in the domain of dairy products such as cheese. Dovedale cheese is produced using milk from local cows that graze on the lush pastures of the surrounding Derbyshire Dales and the nearby area of the Peak District. This region's natural bounty and agricultural history create the ideal conditions for creating high-quality artisan cheese. Dovedale cheese is a blue-veined cheese, meaning that it contains veins of blue mould (Penicillium roqueforti) throughout the cheese. This blue mould imparts a unique flavor and tangy complexity to the cheese, which is favorable among cheese lovers. Dovedale is soft and creamy in texture, with a subtle blue taste that is not overpowering, making it a popular choice for those who may be hesitant about trying blue cheese. The process of making Dovedale cheese starts with collecting fresh milk from local cows, often within the same day of production. The milk is then pasteurized, which involves heating it to a certain temperature to kill any harmful bacteria. Once pasteurized, the milk is cooled, and specific starter cultures, along with the Penicillium roqueforti, are added to begin the process of fermentation. The mixture is then allowed to set and coagulate, transforming from a liquid to a semi-solid mass. At this stage, the curd is cut into small pieces to release the whey, a liquid byproduct, which is drained away. The remaining curds are then carefully moulded into the desired cheese shape and salt is applied to the exterior to further draw out any remaining moisture. During the next stage, the cheeses are put into a special maturation room where the temperature and humidity are carefully controlled to promote the growth of the tell-tale blue veins. Typically, metal or plastic needles are inserted into the cheese to allow oxygen to enter the interior, thereby encouraging the growth of the blue mould. The cheese is then left to mature for several weeks or even months, depending on the desired strength and flavor. Once the maturation process is complete, Dovedale cheese is ready to be enjoyed by cheese enthusiasts. It can be savored on its own or used to add depth to various dishes and recipes. The cheese pairs well with crusty bread, crackers, fruits, chutneys, and robust wines, making it an excellent addition to any cheeseboard or plate. In conclusion, Dovedale cheese, named after the River Dove in the Dovedale valley, is a unique and delicious artisan blue cheese produced solely in Derbyshire, England. Its intriguing taste and character come from the local milk, traditional cheesemaking techniques, and, of course, the blue veins of mould that run through it. As a testimony to the region's gastronomic excellence, Dovedale cheese is a fine example of how geography, culture, and craft can combine to create truly exceptional culinary experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: what is the most famous fountain in rome?","output":"The most famous fountain in Rome is the Trevi Fountain, or 'Fontana di Trevi' in Italian. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Pietro Bracci in 1762, it is among the finest examples of Baroque architecture and an iconic symbol of the Eternal City. Located in the Trevi district, the fountain has a width of roughly 49 meters (160 feet) and a height exceeding 26 meters (85 feet). The Trevi Fountain is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain is an artistic masterpiece with numerous elaborately sculpted statues and mascarons. At its core stands a statue of the sea god Oceanus, sculpted by Pietro Bracci. His chariot, which takes the shape of a shell, is drawn by two sea horses flanked by Tritons. The intricately designed statues and magnificent architecture embody the complexity of nature and the sharp contrast between the almost tranquil left sea horse and the aggressive one on the right. The statues of Abundance and Health located on either side of Oceanus represent the wealth of the sea and its life-giving properties. The water for the Trevi Fountain is supplied by the Acqua Vergine, an ancient Roman aqueduct that has been renovated and extended over the centuries. Originally commissioned by the Emperor Augustus in 19 B.C., the aqueduct was crucial for providing the city with fresh drinking water. Visitors frequently toss coins into the fountain for good luck according to a famous tradition. According to this legend, throwing a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder promises that you will return to Rome. The money that accumulates in the fountain is collected and used to support charitable causes. The Trevi Fountain has appeared in numerous films, books, and artworks, further cementing its status as an iconic symbol of Rome. Perhaps the most well-known cinematic appearance of the fountain is in Federico Fellini's classic 1960 film \\"La Dolce Vita,\\" in which actress Anita Ekberg famously wades into the fountain's waters. Owing to its cultural and historical significance, the Trevi Fountain is a must-see destination for tourists and a favorite spot for locals. While Rome has many other beautiful fountains such as the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona and the fountains in the Villa d'Este gardens in Tivoli, the Trevi Fountain stands out as the most famous and most spectacular, making it a symbol of Rome's rich history and an artistic gem that continues to captivate millions of visitors each year."},{"instruction":"Q:Read the article and select the best answer.

A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells.  Terry and Jake are currently at a dinner party of a mutual friend. They are having a conversation while enjoying a glass of wine when suddenly on the TV there is a commercial about a new disease. This prompts Terry to mention that he actually has sickle cell anemia. Jake, not having the disease, is curious to learn more and asks Terry to explain more about it.  Who has blood cells that struggle to pass through small blood vessels? The answer is:","output":"Terry. Step 1: Determine who has sickle cell anemia from the given information. From the question, we know that Terry mentions that he has sickle cell anemia, while Jake does not have the disease. Step 2: Relate the disease to the red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is caused by an incorrect production of hemoglobin, leading to red blood cells having a sickle shape that makes it difficult for them to pass through the smallest blood vessels. Step 3: Tie the answer back to the individual. Since Terry has sickle cell anemia, his red blood cells have the incorrect hemoglobin and sickle shape, causing them to struggle to pass through small blood vessels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone).  - Marcus Harris ( born October 11 , 1974 ) is a former American college football player who was an All - American wide receiver who played for the University of Wyoming and won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the best college wide receiver in the nation .  - Frederick S. Biletnikoff (born February 23, 1943) is a former gridiron football player and coach. He was a wide receiver for the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons and later an assistant coach with the team. He retired as an NFL player after the 1978 season, and then played one additional season in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Montreal Alouettes in 1980. While he lacked the breakaway speed for deep pass receptions, Biletnikoff was one of the most sure-handed and consistent receivers of his day. He was also known for running smooth, precise pass routes. He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.  - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.  - The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist.  - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This...  Guess a valid title for it!

She patrols the L.A. streets and stumbles into an old boyfriend, who introduces Claire to his wife and ill-behaved daughter. Reeling from the chance encounter, she steps out onto the street and is hit by a passing vehicle. Claire is forced to stay at home with a broken right ankle, wrist and a broken left arm and feeling helpless to get around. Her mother, whom gets arround the house in a wheelchair with her right side almost completely inmobile and can only speak with grunts and hummings, implies to Claire to find a man to marry and settle down. A box containing a minature Christmas tree arrives and both are now seemingly happy to decorate the tree and the house with Christmas lights.Returning to work three weeks later, Claire attracts the attention of another parking attendant, an extremely blunt and aggressive man, named Jay (Jason Patric), whose home life consists mainly of entertaining himself using the services of a webcam porn site and phone service.

To provide some context, let us discuss the other options briefly and explain why they are not the most suitable options to answer this particular question. - Apartment complex: An apartment complex is a group of buildings containing multiple individual residential units or apartments. While it is true that many apartment complexes offer parking areas for their residents, it is the people who live within these buildings who are actually keeping their cars in the provided parking spaces. - School yard: A school yard is an outdoor area that belongs to a school. Although some schools might have parking lots for the faculty, staff, and student population, their main purpose is to provide an area for education-related activities. Thus, a school yard itself is not an entity that keeps cars in a parking area. - Amusement park: An amusement park is a place where people can go to enjoy various games, rides, and attractions. While many amusement parks offer parking lots for their visitors, the actual park (as an entity) is not the one keeping the cars in the parking area. It is the visitors (people) themselves who park their vehicles while they enjoy the park's attractions. - Apartment building: Similar to the apartment complex, an apartment building comprises several residential units or apartments. While the building might offer parking spaces for its residents, the building itself (as an entity) is not the one that keeps the cars in the parking area. It is the people who live within the building who are responsible for keeping their cars in the parking area. In conclusion, although the other options may relate to places where cars are often parked, the most suitable option to answer the question \\"Who keeps their car in a parking area?\\" is \\"people.\\" People own and operate vehicles, and they are the ones who make use of parking areas to store their cars when not in use.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Market analysts in the United States have recently been quoted as saying that the biggest threat to the luxury   industry in the US is the tech industry. This is according to an article by fellow journalist Ashley Lutz. Her suggestion is sound. The main idea of her article is that products from Tiffany & Co. find their biggest competition not from other luxury brands but from companies like Apple. Lutz points out that luxury products are often only for \\"show,\\" while the attraction behind tech products is functionality. You find few people in the United States today willing to purchase luxury goods at full price. It didn't use to be that way. Luxury goods used to be actually _ . That meant you needed to travel to the right store to purchase them, and you didn't even have the option of getting a deal. Today, no one wants to pay full price for luxury goods. People have the unfortunate belief that fakes   somehow are equal to originals, and if you can't get a deal on eBay, Amazon, or in an outlet store, purchasing a luxury product probably isn't worth it. Luxury brands struggle to remain high-end   images despite the reality that the American consumer is motivated much more by discounts than they are by brand names or image. Yet people stand in line to pay full price for a new product from Apple and crowds gather to hear about a new smart phone. While electronics are updating every day, people are purchasing technology at full prices much more than they are purchasing luxury goods. What are high-tech makers doing right that luxury makers are pitifully failing at? Carefully looking at the situation, it would appear as if the Internet didn't hurt the luxury industry, expectation from the consumers did. What people want these days more than anything is stuff that does something. They want cars that drive, shoes that are comfortable, games that are fun to play, screens that are beautiful to look at, tools that are useful, and entertainment that is entertaining. Little of that fits into what the luxury industry has... Question: What does this passage mainly talk about? Options: A: Nobody likes luxury goods any more.

The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Cayey is a mountain municipality in central Puerto Rico located on the Central Mountain range, north of Salinas and Guayama; south of Cidra and Caguas; east of Aibonito and Salinas; and west of San Lorenzo. Cayey is spread over 21 wards plus Cayey Pueblo, the downtown area and the administrative center of the city. It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.  - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  - Barrio is a Spanish word meaning neighborhood. In Spain, several Latin American countries and the Philippines, the term is also used officially to denote a division of a municipality.  - Puerto Rico Highway 1 (or PR-1) connects the city of Ponce to San Juan. Leaving Ponce, the road heads east and follows a somewhat parallel route along the southern coast of the island heading towards Salinas. At Salinas, the road turns north to cut through the Cordillera Central in its approach to San Juan. Before reaching San Juan, it climbs to make its way to the mountain town of Cayey and then it winds down into the city of Caguas on its final approach to San Juan.  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - Puerto Rico Highway 14 is a main highway connecting Cayey, Puerto Rico to Ponce, Puerto Rico. The road uses the same path as the historic old Carretera Central.  - Puerto Rico Highway 12 , also called Malecon Avenue , and Santiago de los Caballeros Avenue , is a 5.28 - kilometer , limited - access highway entirely located within the city limits of Ponce , Puerto Rico , and connecting Puerto Rico Highway 14 to the La Guancha area in Barrio Playa in Ponce . It is similar to a freeway but has one traffic light near its intersection with PR - 14 . The highway has four exits : PR - 52 , PR - 2 , PR - 133/Calle Comercio , and PR - 163 . Since PR - 12 's southern terminus is at the Port of Ponce , its traffic volume is expected to grow as construction in the new Port of the Americas is completed .  - Ponce is both a city and a municipality in the southern part of Puerto Rico. The city is the seat of the municipal government.  - The Philippines, officially the Republic of the Philippines, is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean.

Unassuming: Dorothy O'Grady's neighbours knew her as a guest house landlady whose greatest pleasure was walking her Labrador, Rob. To her neighbours Dorothy O'Grady was a pleasant middle-aged woman who liked walking her Labrador around their sleepy seaside town. So when the unassuming landlady of Osborne Villa in the Isle of Wight was suddenly arrested in 1940 on suspicion of being a Nazi spy, few believed it possible. O'Grady's husband had been sent to London to aid the fire service, the couple's guest house in Sandown had been closed and O'Grady was left to her own devices. The Channel island was flooded with soldiers, military bases and equipment. The neighbours thought O'Grady wandered with dog Rob to stave off the loneliness but the police had their suspicions. They believed O'Grady's dog walks were just a ruse, that in fact she was gathering intelligence into restricted military areas. She was accused of making detailed maps, cutting military telephone wires and wearing a small swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel. She was tried and convicted in Winchester of betraying her country and became the first British woman to be sentenced to death for treason. She escaped the gallows after her lawyer successfully won an appeal for misdirection of the jury. Instead, she was jailed for 14 years. But tantalizingly, O'Grady's story does not end there. On her release in 1950 she went straight to Fleet Street insisting her 'spying' activities were a bit of fun or a 'lark', as she put it, which got rather out of hand. Shock: But in 1940 O'Grady was charged with being a Nazi spy and sentenced to death. This mugshot is from 1918 after she was arrested for forging bank notes. Why? An extract from O'Grady's detailed map of the Isle of Wight's eastern coastline in 1940 shows she concentrated on the defences in and around Sandown Bay, an area initially earmarked for invasion by Germany. She told the Daily Express that 'the whole thing was a joke', and that she 'looked forward to the trial as an immense thrill'. She said: 'The excitement of being tried for my life was intense... It made me feel somebody instead of being an ordinary seaside landlady.' O'Grady died aged 83 in 1985 and her version of events was generally accepted until 1995. Then her prosecution papers were released and it became plain just how serious a threat she constituted to national security in 1940. Landlady: Pictured last year, this is Osborne Villa, in Sandown, O'Grady's. guest house home at the time of her arrest in 1940. She escaped the gallows and was sentenced to 14 years in prison but returned to the villa on her release in 1950. Familiar: O'Grady was twice jailed at HMP Aylesbury, once for Borstal training and then in 1941 to serve her wartime crimes sentence. On her second visit the prison psychologist found her to be highly disturbed. The papers said the maps she drew were 'terrifyingly accurate', and 'would be of very great importance to the enemy'. Isle of Wight MP Barry Field had championed her cause, but was shocked when the papers were released. He said: 'I set out to clear her name, but I am staggered by the treachery she sunk to. She could have altered the direction of the war.' But the notion of 'Dotty' Dorothy being just another unhinged fantasist persisted. Now book, The Spy Beside the Sea, based on hitherto unseen reports unearthed by author Adrian Searle has shed new light on the mystery. Keeping watch: O'Grady had made notes on troop movements on the island, including the use of bicycles by the 6th Black Watch. Key area: After war broke out, the Isle of Wight became a key defensive position and thousands of troops were stationed there. Using research by the BBC journalist Peter Hill, Mr Searle began digging into O'Grady's past and uncovered documents that, more than any other, offer the most likely explanation of who Mrs Dorothy O'Grady really was. She had enjoyed a comfortable childhood with her adoptive parents, a British Museum official and his wife, in Clapham, south London. That all ended before her eleventh birthday when her mother died and father married his vindictive housekeeper, who bullied the young Dorothy. In 1918 after a spell in a home for young girls training for a life of domestic service, she was in trouble and well known as a 'thoroughly bad lot'. That year she was sent to borstal after forging banks notes and in 1920 served two years' hard labour for stealing clothes from her employer in Brighton. Timings: This official photograph was taken at Culver Down Battery on 24 August 1940 as O'Grady was compiling maps and drawing sketches of the Isle of Wight's coastal defences. Important: Culver Down Battery's 9.2in guns were an important component in the defence of the island. O'Grady noted their presence on her maps. Spying: In post-war interviews it was clear O'Grady had also been keeping an eye on the nearest of four Solent sea forts at St Helens. Was she working for Hitler? When she was arrested by troops on the island, O'Grady had a swastika badge on the underside of her coat lapel. On her return to London some years later, O'Grady gathered a collection of convictions for prostitution. The fourth saw her locked up in Holloway for three weeks. On her release she married Vincent O'Grady, a London fireman 19 years her senior. And on his retirement the couple moved to the Isle of Wight, but when war broke out in 1939 he was put back into service and she was left alone. The soldiers stationed on the island had at first thought the then 42-year-old O'Grady, who was always hanging around with her dog, was just a nuisance. This map of the Isle of Wight in 1940, shows O’Grady’s close proximity to military installations. East. 1. St Helens (Sea) Fort – searchlights. 2.

She was booked, and ordered to appear before Ryde Magistrates' Court, a hearing which she didn't turn up for. Then, when police arrived at her villa they found it locked. O'Grady had gone on the run. It took three weeks to track her down. In that time she had made more maps, cut phone wires, and, unusually for an undercover agent, offered schoolboys small bribes to tell her about army gun emplacements. Her previous convictions for prostitution and fraud came out in the subsequent trial and this, it was later suggested, was the reason she had gone on the run, fearing her husband would find out. O'Grady was subject to psychological testing at Aylesbury Prison, where she served the majority of her sentence. And the reports into her mental health by the prison governor and psychologist, unearthed by Mr Searle using the Freedom of Information Act, give the most likely explanation of her so-called spying activities. Difficult childhood: The young Dorothy O'Grady almost certainly received her. truncated convent schooling at Convent of Notre Dame in London but by 1918 she was well known as a 'thoroughly bad lot' Criminal career: As well as the conviction for forgery, O'Grady also racked up convictions for stealing clothes and prostitution before being sentenced to death for treason. Death: O'Grady died aged 83 in 1985. This photograph was taken four years before her death while she was living in sheltered housing at Lake, on the Isle of Wight. The Spy Beside the Sea by by Adrian Searle is published on Thursday. According to the governor, O'Grady appeared to be a highly disturbed, and highly intelligent woman with a deep grudge against authority. The reports made clear she regularly self-harmed, and had 'attacks... in which she has to \\"obey people\\" inside her who encourage her to do harmful acts to herself'. She had enacted a pretend hanging by placing a chair on her cell bed, and sometimes slept naked under the bed. They also noted a sexual dimension to her behaviour, which included tying herself in awkward positions for hours at a time. The prison medical officer Dr Violet Minster reported that O'Grady inserted an alarming collection of objects into her vagina. These included a light bulb, more than 50 pieces of broken glass, a small pot, and 100 pins. In the fascinating book of the story that has remained a mystery for more than 70 years, Mr Searle believes this evidence shows O'Grady was not a spy but a woman who sought the limelight. But, while there is no evidence she ever attempted to communicate her information to anyone in any way, it is not impossible that she was hedging her bets, calculating, perhaps, that if the Nazis invaded, she would be able to prove her loyalty to the new cause. The Spy Beside the Sea by Adrian Searle is published by The History Press on Thursday 24 May at £12.99. The eBook is now on offer in the Amazon Kindle store for £3.42 (usual price around £10). Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article revolves around Dorothy O'Grady, a British woman accused of being a Nazi spy during World War II. Known as a pleasant landlady who owned a guest house in the Isle of Wight, her arrest in 1940 for espionage came as a shock to her neighbors. O'Grady was suspected of gathering intelligence on restricted military areas during her routine dog walks around military bases stationed on the island. She was charged with making detailed maps, tampering with military communication, and wearing a small swastika badge. O'Grady became the first British woman sentenced to death for treason, though she later escaped the gallows after her lawyer won an appeal, leading to a 14-year imprisonment instead. Upon her release in 1950, O'Grady insisted that her spying activities were more of a 'lark' or joke that got way out of hand. However, her prosecution papers released in 1995 presented a clearer picture of the threat she posed to national security. Unearthed papers suggest that she was highly disturbed, and her spying activities may have been the result of a deep grudge against authority and a craving for attention, though it is also suggested that she might have been gathering information to prove her loyalty if the Nazis invaded.  The story about Dorothy O'Grady's life and alleged spying activities are detailed in \\"The Spy Beside the Sea,\\" a book by Adrian Searle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries.

We have this equation: i - 186 = -21 * i + 11 * i - 43 Imagine, if i is the number of apples you have, we need to find out how many apples you actually have. Let's make the equation simpler. We have -21 * i and 11 * i, we can combine them because they are both talking about apples (i). So, let's add the number of apples together: -21 * i and 11 * i will be -10 * i (because -21 + 11 = -10) Now, our equation looks like this: i - 186 = -10*i - 43 Now what we want to do is bring all the apples (i) to one side, and the numbers without apples to the other side. Let's bring -10 * i to the left side by adding 10 * i to both sides: i + 10*i = -43 + 186 Now, when we do this, we have: 11*i = 143 Now, our equation says that 11 times some apples (i) equals 143. We want to find out how many apples (i), so we'll divide 143 by 11. 143 ÷ 11 = 13 So now we know that i (the number of apples) is 13."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Renfield","output":"Title: \\"Dracula's Puppet\\" Step 1: Establish the main characters - Mina Harker: A smart and resourceful woman who becomes the unwitting target of Dracula's devious plan. - Dracula: The age-old vampire lord, seeking to expand his power and control. - Renfield: A former patient at a mental institution who falls under Dracula's influence, turning him into a loyal and dangerous servant. Step 2: Develop the backstory - Mina Harker, tragically widowed after her husband was killed in an unexplained accident, moves to a small town to start anew. - Renfield, after being discharged from the mental institution, has no place to go and ends up in the same town where Mina resides. - Dracula, sensing an opportunity to exploit the vulnerable townsfolk and create more vampire minions, decides to instill fear by manipulating the events in the town. Step 3: Establish the main plot - Mina discovers that the town has been experiencing a string of strange and unexplained deaths. Her curiosity and intellect lead her to investigate. - Renfield, now under Dracula's control, becomes obsessed with Mina as he believes that she holds the key to understanding life and death, which could ultimately free him from Dracula's grip. - Dracula, aware of Mina's interest in the town's mysteries, orders Renfield to strangle her as a means of sending a message to those attempting to uncover his plans. Step 4: Build suspense and conflict - Mina starts to piece together clues about the town's dark secret and suspects the involvement of Dracula, but she (and the rest of the town) do not truly know what they are dealing with. - Renfield, conflicted between his fascination toward Mina and his loyalty to Dracula, plots to strangle her but is torn by his internal struggle. Step 5: Climax - In a tense scene filled with emotional turmoil, Renfield finally confronts Mina. - Just as he begins to follow Dracula's orders and strangle her, Mina pleads with him by appealing to his inner humanity. She tells him that there is hope to break free from Dracula's control, and together, they can restore peace in the town. - In a last-minute change of heart, Renfield decides to spare Mina and join her in the fight against Dracula. Step 6: Resolution - Mina and Renfield unite with other townsfolk to form a coalition against Dracula, eventually driving him out of their town. - Grateful for Mina's intervention, Renfield finds redemption and a new purpose, while Mina honors her late husband by dedicating herself to helping others affected by Dracula's evil reign. In this movie plot, it is Renfield who tries to strangle Mina on Dracula's order, but his internal conflict and Mina's compassionate plea change the course of both their lives. This sets up a thrilling story filled with intrigue, danger, and redemption, as they join forces to defeat Dracula and save their town."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the early-20th century, people like Ordway Tead (1891-1973), Walter Dill Scott (1869-1955) and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Other writers, such as Elton Mayo (1880-1949), Mary Follett (1868-1933), Chester Barnard (1886-1961), Max Weber (1864-1920), who saw what he called the \\"administrator\\" as bureaucrat, Rensis Likert (1903-1981), and Chris Argyris (born 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a sociology perspective. Question: Who lived longer, Walter Dill Scott or Max Weber? Answer:","output":"Walter Dill Scott lived longer than Max Weber. Walter Dill Scott lived from 1869 to 1955, enjoying a lifespan of 86 years. Meanwhile, Max Weber's lifespan was from 1864 to 1920, which comes to a total of 56 years. Walter Dill Scott outlived Max Weber by 30 years."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Question: \\"The act of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines is a?\\"  Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The act of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines is considered apostasy. In the context provided, if a baptized member is accused of apostasy, a judicial committee is formed to determine their guilt, provide help, and possibly administer discipline. The strongest form of discipline, disfellowshipping, may be administered if the offender is deemed unrepentant. This involves shunning the individual, limiting contact with disfellowshipped persons, and potentially affecting their social and spiritual interactions with others in the congregation. The practice of shunning aims to keep the congregation free from immoral influence and deter other members from dissident behavior. If expelled individuals show repentance, they may eventually be reinstated into the congregation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on.

Write an article with the title: \\"Thai PM pleads for unity amid protests\\" Article:","output":"Title: Thai PM pleads for unity amid protests Introduction Over the past few months, Thailand's political situation has been rattled by intense protests calling for major changes in the nation's governance structure. In response, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, has made various attempts to quell the unrest, pleading for unity and proposing dialogues with different factions. This article will delve into the factors that have led to these widespread demonstrations, examine the government's response, and explore the potential implications for the nation's future. Background of Protests Sparked in early 2020, the protests in Thailand have grown significantly in scale and intensity, with tens of thousands of citizens flooding the streets of Bangkok and other cities. While the demonstrations initially began in response to the dissolution of the opposition Future Forward Party by the Constitutional Court, protesters' demands have since expanded to include the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha, a change in the nation's constitution, and a reformation of the monarchy's role in politics. Marchers, including students and members of the general public, are urging for a more democratic government system and an end to the military's intervention in politics. The very public display of dissent against the Thai monarchy, which is considered sacred and enjoys considerable protection under the nation's strict Lèse-majesté laws, underscores the gravity and urgency of these ongoing protests. Thai PM's Call for Unity As the protests grow increasingly aggressive, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha has made several attempts to defuse the situation and restore stability. Acknowledging that the demonstrations have highlighted the need to discuss the nation's governance structure, he has pleaded for unity among the Thai people, emphasizing the importance of finding a peaceful solution to prevent further harm to the nation and its people. In a bid to facilitate dialogue among various factions, Prayuth has lifted a previously issued severe state of emergency in Bangkok and has expressed willingness to hold talks with the protest leaders. By demonstrating flexibility and willingness to listen to the protesters' concerns, the Thai PM hopes to garner support from opposing factions and foster understanding to facilitate progress towards unity. Implications for Thailand's Future The future of Thailand's political landscape is uncertain, given the unprecedented scale of these protests and the intensity of the demands from the public. Should the government successfully engage in meaningful dialogue with the protesters, the nation may see steps towards a more democratic society, with amendments to the constitution that curtail the monarchy's powers and reduce the military's involvement in politics. Conversely, if these discussions fail to materialize, or if the stakes escalate, the prospect of further unrest looms as demonstrators remain committed to pushing for radical changes. This ongoing instability could have significant consequences for Thailand's national unity, its international reputation, and its economic growth. In light of these potential outcomes, it is crucial that the Thai government and the protesters maintain open lines of communication to encourage peaceful resolutions that reflect the will and desires of the Thai people. Achieving consensus and unity in these difficult times may well prove to be a defining moment in Thailand's history, marking an important step towards a more inclusive, democratic future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pavement was formed in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, \\"It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for 1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band.\\" Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed 800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.Slay Tracks was recorded during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, \\"You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a guide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top.\\" Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, \\"[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'\\" Kannberg said, \\"We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it.\\" The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.

Please answer the following question: Background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  Paragraph: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","output":"Group A Based on the provided information, group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1,000 calories a day for 2 years, which led to significant weight gain for the individuals in group B. As a result, group A would have had fewer people who may become obese, primarily because they followed a normal diet and did not consume an excess of calories on a daily basis. One of the key factors in obesity is the consistent consumption of more food energy (calories) than needed, leading to weight gain and an increase in body fat. By following a normal diet, individuals in group A maintained a more balanced energy intake, reducing their risk of obesity and related health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, the additional 1,000 calories a day consumed by individuals in group B would have contributed to more stored body fat and an elevated risk of obesity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Arctic ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, while the Pacific ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates under its waters.  and a hint : At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

OPT: (1). yes; (2). it is not possible to tell; (3). no;","output":"(2). it is not possible to tell Based on the provided premise that two men are walking in front of a Farmers Market, we cannot conclusively determine if the hypothesis stating that these two men are looking for ripe melons is true. The premise only informs us of the presence of the two men and the Farmers Market but not their intention or reasons for being there. There could be multiple reasons for their presence, such as discussing business, meeting friends or family, or shopping for various items, including fruits, vegetables, or other products. It is essential to consider that people visit Farmers Markets for diverse reasons, and melons are just one specific item that might or might not be on their shopping list. Without further information about their conversation, specific actions, or intentions, the given premise does not allow us to definitively conclude that the proposed hypothesis is true.

Options: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","output":"The premise: \\"um uh of course we're we're not we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half\\" is effectively saying that the price of a new Cadillac is too expensive to consider. This could suggest that the speaker, who we can assume is the one making the purchasing decision, does not have the necessary financial resources to purchase a new Cadillac. There is an expressed consideration of the drastic price decrease that happens after a car is three years old, which could mean that the person is looking for more financially viable alternatives. The hypothesis \\"We cannot afford to buy a new Cadillac at the moment\\" fits the information provided in the premise. The premise clearly implies that the price of a brand new Cadillac is out of their affordability range, thereby suggesting that they cannot afford it. We could therefore confidently regard the hypothesis as being entailed in the premise. However, it also important to note here that the premise only prohibits the consideration of buying a new Cadillac, it does not categorically state that it is unaffordable. This could possibly mean that the speaker might be capable of affording the car, but simply does not see it as a financially prudent decision due to the significant depreciation that happens after three years. Despite this, the most straightforward interpretation of the premise would suggest that the speaker is working within a particular budget that does not accommodate the cost of a new Cadillac. Therefore, a reasonable inference can be drawn that the speaker cannot afford to buy a new Cadillac at the moment. So, we can choose option A – Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis \\"We cannot afford to buy a new Cadillac at the moment.\\"."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Burdette overhears the governor yelling at an assistant to take responsibility for transporting a crate of unknown content from Miami to the Republican Party convention in Dallas. Burdett schemes to deliver the crate to the convention. He enlists Bandit (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus (Jerry Reed) to carry out the task. Cledus attempts to convince the Bandit to \\"do it one last time.\\" Unfortunately, in the time since their previous challenge, the Bandit has split from his love interest Carrie aka \\"Frog\\" (Sally Field) and become an alcoholic. The Bandit is said to be \\"the only man in the world to drink up a Trans Am.\\" Cledus seeks the help of Frog to encourage the Bandit to sober up, since Big Enos has raised the stakes to 400,000. Frog abandons her second attempt at marrying Buford T. Justice's (Jackie Gleason) son Junior (Mike Henry). She is initially persuaded more by the money than her love for Bandit. She buys him a 1980 Pontiac Trans Am named \\"Son of Trigger,\\" powered by the Pontiac 301 Turbo, by trading in Junior's car. A race ensues as the trio once again tries to outrun and outwit Justice and Junior. Their cargo is in quarantine for three weeks, and they need to get it to Dallas in three days. When they steal it, the mysterious cargo turns out to be an elephant (mascot of the Republican Party), whom they name Charlotte after Snowman says she reminded him of his Aunt Charlotte and smelled like her, too. When Cledus opens the crate, Charlotte nearly tramples Frog. The Bandit saves the day by doing a backflip onto the elephant's back and riding her out of the quarantine shed. Noticing a splinter stuck in her foot, the Bandit removes it, and the elephant takes a shine to him. Cledus fears Charlotte is in poor health. They meet an Italian...

The second effect mentioned is \\"water droplets are in clouds.\\" In warmer conditions, the rate of evaporation will be higher, leading to more water vapor in the atmosphere.

Hypothesis: There isn't nothing that identifies the support staff and the White House Fellow Step 2: Identify any discrepancies in phrasing The main difference between the premise and hypothesis lies in their use of double negatives. The premise has a single negative (\\"there is nothing\\") while the hypothesis contains a double negative (\\"there isn't nothing\\"). Step 3: Simplify the hypothesis by removing the double negatives \\"There isn't nothing\\" can be simplified to \\"there is something,\\" as the double negative essentially negates itself. So, the simplified hypothesis is: Hypothesis (simplified): There is something that identifies the support staff and the White House Fellow.

The Paris Colonial Exposition was a large-scale fair held from May 6 to November 15, 1931, in the Bois de Vincennes park located in Paris, France. The purpose of this exposition was to showcase the cultures, materials, and resources of French colonies around the world. Many pavilions were constructed representing various colonies, including the Cameroon pavilion, which was designed by French architect Louis-Hippolyte Boileau. After the exposition, many of these pavilions were either disassembled or repurposed. The Cameroon pavilion, an elegant wooden structure, was transformed into a Buddhist temple in 1977. The temple, constructed in traditional Asian pagoda-style architecture, is surrounded by a beautiful and serene park, near Lake Daumesnil.  This Buddhist temple has since become a prominent place of worship for the Buddhist community in France. It houses a number of religious artifacts, including a large golden statue of Buddha, and is considered an important center for the study and practice of Buddhism in Europe. Comprising of four tiered structures, the temple is adorned with intricately carved wooden panels depicting various scenes from Buddha’s life.

The sentiment of the tweet, \\"Going to eat my dinner now,\\" can be considered positive for several reasons. First and foremost, eating a meal, particularly dinner, is typically associated with enjoyable experiences such as satisfying hunger, enjoying tasty food, and sometimes sharing time with family or friends.

The fact that they are sharing this information publicly on social media suggests that they want others to know they are engaging in a positive activity. Another aspect to consider is the tone of the tweet. The message is written in a simple, straightforward manner, which does not express any negative emotions or frustration. There are no negative words or phrases in the tweet, and there is nothing to suggest any discontent or dissatisfaction with the situation.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.

You know, the good ol’ nature. One time, me and my buddy Alex and some friends decided we were going to go camping. (I know, basic camping story. Well not exactly.) We planned on going for the weekend. Got to the spot and put up our tents like normal campers. But knowing myself and my friends we wanted to drink a couple beers and do some fishing. We did just that. Later that night we had started out camp fire and cooked up some links before bed time. My drunk self wanted to keep the fire going all night to prevent wild animals from coming t our sight. Well at least I thought that’d help. So I needed a bunch of wood to do so. Everyone was asleep by this point but me. So I took myself out into the woods a little deeper to grab a full broken down tree. I thought to myself, “Well if I want to utilize all of this wood I’m going to need to break it into smaller prices right?” Wrong. Well at least it was wrongful of how I planned on doing it. I attempted to break the tree in half by throwing it against another tree, as if I were as strong as the hulk or something. Once I chunked the tree at this tree I messed the entire vacation up. The tree came down on my knee and crushed it. I was in so much pain. I realized that I messed it up pretty bad so I laid there for a second trying to get back to my feet.

Here is a question about this article: Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. What is the answer to this question: What is the action of food being moved into the stomach?","output":"The action of food being moved into the stomach is called \\"peristalsis.\\" It's like a special wave that helps push the food down from your throat (the esophagus) into your tummy (the stomach).

Please answer the following question: Greg Tenorly drove the familiar route from the church to his music studio, studying the homes along the way. He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling. His little studio was near the town square, nestled between Coreyville Hardware and Susie's Sewing Box. Occasionally he and a student could hear a pipe wrench or hammer hitting the floor on the hardware side. But things were always quiet from Susie's side. At least the soundproofing he had installed kept his neighbors from hearing his students. You can't teach music without hearing both beautiful sounds and sour notes.

Write the answer: The premature same-age deaths of Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse prompted the popular '(What number?) Club' theory?","output":"The premature same-age deaths of Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse prompted the popular '27 Club' theory. The 27 Club refers to the phenomenon of highly talented musicians and artists who tragically died at the young age of 27. This theory gained traction following the untimely deaths of these influential figures in music history, leading to a widespread belief that the age of 27 is particularly cursed or holds some form of significance for artists. Brian Jones, the founder and original leader of The Rolling Stones, was the first of these notable musicians to pass away at 27 on July 3, 1969. His death was ruled as \\"death by misadventure,\\" as he drowned in his swimming pool under mysterious circumstances. Jimi Hendrix, the pioneering and influential guitarist, died on September 18, 1970, from asphyxia after choking on his vomit while intoxicated. His innovative style, blending rock and blues with his extraordinary guitar skills, made him a pivotal figure in the history of rock music. Janis Joplin, a powerful singer with an unmistakable voice, tragically died of a heroin overdose on October 4, 1970. As the lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and later, as a solo artist, Joplin made her mark as the “Queen of Rock and Roll” and is remembered as a feminist icon. Jim Morrison, the enigmatic and poetic frontman of The Doors, passed away on July 3, 1971. His cause of death is still a subject of debate, with no official autopsy performed. Nonetheless, it is suspected that he suffered from heart failure, possibly induced by drug use. Morrison's provocative lyrics and performances earned him the moniker of the \\"Lizard King.\\" Kurt Cobain, the lead singer and songwriter for the groundbreaking grunge band Nirvana, committed suicide on April 5, 1994. Cobain's death was a significant loss to the music world, as Nirvana's contributions to the grunge movement of the 1990s were immense. Amy Winehouse, the soulful British singer known for her signature beehive hairstyle and powerful vocals, died on July 23, 2011. Her death was ruled as accidental alcohol poisoning, and Winehouse's struggles with addiction were well-documented in the media. Although the 27 Club theory has captured the imagination of the public and sparked fascination, it is vital to remember that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. It is essential to take into account individual factors that may have contributed to the artists' respective vulnerabilities and the circumstances surrounding their untimely deaths. Furthermore, a number of other artists have died at different ages, and the fixation on 27 can simply be a result of pattern-seeking behavior. However, the 27 Club will continue to intrigue and remind us of the great talents who left the world too soon at the same young age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The industrial complex covers about 100 acres (40 ha) on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982. This federally funded program employed up to 45 young people for local conservation projects in the state parks and forests and on state game lands. In addition, Sylvania Electric Products used two buildings in the industrial complex as warehouses for light bulbs until 1993.

If \\"a white dog is running on a grassy path carrying a yellow object in its mouth.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A dog running carrying something to his owner.\\"?","output":"While the statement, \\"a white dog is running on a grassy path carrying a yellow object in its mouth,\\" provides a clear description of a scenario, it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that \\"A dog is running, carrying something to his owner\\" without making several assumptions. To establish a logical connection between the two statements, let's examine the key points: 1. The dog's color: the first statement mentions a \\"white dog\\", while the second statement generically refers to \\"a dog\\". Although it's not a direct contradiction, the second statement does not specify that the dog in question is white. Despite this minor discrepancy, it's reasonable to assume that both statements could be referring to the same dog. 2. The dog is running: both statements describe a running dog, which aligns. This point supports the possibility of the two statements being interconnected. 3. Carrying an object: both statements mention that the dog is carrying an object, but the first one specifies the object as being yellow. The second statement doesn't provide any details about the object in question. It's entirely possible that both refer to the same yellow object, but without further information, this remains a speculative connection. 4. The intended recipient of the object: the first statement doesn't mention the dog carrying the object to anyone, while the second statement assumes that the dog is taking the object to its owner. This is a crucial point, as the two statements don't necessarily agree on this aspect. The dog could be carrying the object for various reasons such as playing fetch with someone who is not its owner, or it might be carrying it aimlessly without any intention of giving it to someone. In conclusion, while the two statements share some similarities, it does not logically follow that \\"A dog running carrying something to his owner\\" based solely on the given information. To make such a claim, further evidence or context would be required—specifically regarding the dog's intention to deliver the object to its owner. Even with the assumption that the statements refer to the same dog and object, the intended recipient's aspect remains uncertain without additional details."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a reversal of previous statements, Yuri Zarutsky, who was alleged to be the hired 'hitman' who became involved in the attack on Mr Dmitrichenko's behalf, said he initiated the attack independently. 'When I heard what happened to","output":"Sergei Filin, I was outraged and decided to take matters into my own hands,' Zarutsky told the court. 'Pavel Dmitrichenko had nothing to do with it, and he never asked me to carry out the attack.' This new revelation raises questions about the true motive behind the attack, as well as the potential involvement of other individuals. Previously, Dmitrichenko had been accused of organizing the attack due to alleged professional rivalry with Filin, the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director. Filin had suffered severe facial disfigurement and almost total loss of his eyesight as a result of the assault, which took place on January 17, 2013. Zarutsky's latest statement appears to place the sole responsibility for the attack on himself. Authorities, however, are likely to continue investigating the case to uncover any additional evidence that may corroborate or refute Zarutsky's current claim of acting alone. The high-profile case has drawn considerable attention both nationally and internationally, as the Bolshoi Ballet holds a cherished position in the world of performing arts. The acid attack has highlighted the potential for intense rivalries and malicious actions within the tightly-knit dance community. As the trial continues, the judge will assess the credibility of Zarutsky's latest testimony, taking into account any evidence or witness accounts presented by the prosecution and defense. Ultimately, the outcome of the case may hinge on whether the court accepts Zarutsky's assertion that he acted independently, without any influence or encouragement from Dmitrichenko or other parties."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though many of the events were outside the traditional time-period of the Middle Ages, the end of the unity of the Western Church (the Protestant Reformation), was one of the distinguishing characteristics of the medieval period. The Catholic Church had long fought against heretic movements, but during the Late Middle Ages, it started to experience demands for reform from within. The first of these came from Oxford professor John Wycliffe in England. Wycliffe held that the Bible should be the only authority in religious questions, and he spoke out against transubstantiation, celibacy and indulgences. In spite of influential supporters among the English aristocracy, such as John of Gaunt, the movement was not allowed to survive.

Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings.

The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme).\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The key to the administration of the caliphate, specifically in the context of the Ottoman Caliphate, can be attributed to several important factors: 1. Centralized authority: The Ottoman sultan served as the Empire's sole regent, embodying the government and exercising control over its administration. 2. Influence of the Imperial Harem: The Imperial Harem, ruled by the Valide Sultan, was a significant power at the Ottoman court. At times, the women of the Harem controlled the state, particularly during the \\"Sultanate of Women,\\" in which the Valide Sultan involved herself in state politics. 3. Succession process: Sultans were chosen from the sons of the previous sultan, with the palace's educational system focused on eliminating unfit potential heirs while establishing support for a successor among the ruling elite. 4. Strong educational system: The palace schools provided education not only for the future sultans but also for the state administrators. These schools included the Madrasa for Muslims, which educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic traditions, and the Enderûn for Christians, a free boarding school that inducted Christian boys through the Devshirme system. These educational institutions enabled social mobility for the empire's subjects and fostered a capable administration. Overall, the key to the administration of the Ottoman Caliphate involved a centralized authority, influence from the Imperial Harem, a strategic succession process, and a robust educational system that cultivated the next generation of sultans and state administrators."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What's the name of the person whose birth causes Sarah to die? from the following article ?

If you don't have an elevated rack, crumple up several sheets of aluminum foil and scatter them across the bottom of the baking dish. You'll need to keep the pork belly elevated as it cooks to help the fat render more readily. Using a sharp knife, the skin of the pork belly in a cross-hatch pattern. Slice across the skin in vertical rows spaced 2 inches (5 cm) apart, then create a series of perpendicular slices that are also spaced 2 inches (5 cm) apart.  Pierce through the tough skin and the top layer of fat, but do not cut too deeply into the actual meat lying beneath the two. Scoring the meat in this manner will allow more of the fat to render out during the roasting process. Place the pork belly on your prepared baking rack with the skin-side facing up. Rub the top with oil, then generously season the meat with salt and pepper.  In addition to seasoning the meat, the oil and salt make it easier for the fat to render out, resulting in crispier skin. Apply the seasonings by hand, and work the salt and pepper into the slits across the skin. Note that salt and pepper should withstand the roasting process without deteriorating, but other spices and herbs might burn. If you decide to add others, do so within the final 30 minutes of cooking. Place the seasoned pork belly in the preheated oven. Roast it for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the skin browns and begins to look crispy.  This brief period of high heat will not cook the pork through, nor should you cook the pork belly at this high heat for the entire time. The intense heat is only meant to crisp the skin. Do not wait for the skin to become dark brown or fully crisped since it will continue cooking at a lower temperature. Cooking it for too much time at a high heat could cause it to burn before the rest of the meat finishes. Decrease the temperature without removing the pork belly. Allow the meat to cook for another 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until done.  Check the pork belly halfway through the cooking process. If the fat gets too hot, it may start to smoke, and you'll need to transfer the meat to a clean baking dish. The pork belly must reach a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) before you remove it from the oven. After removing the pork belly from the oven, allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving it. During this time, the juices should distribute themselves and settle within the meat. Roasted pork belly will have crispy skin, but the inner meat should be tender and moist.  Store any leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. When reheating the leftovers, sear the slices in a skillet so that the skin remains crispy.","output":"This article provides a detailed method for roasting pork belly with crispy skin, involving preparation, scoring, seasoning, roasting at high heat, reducing temperature to finish cooking, resting before carving, and storing and reheating leftovers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sinn Féin reiterated on Saturday that it would not go back into government with Mrs Foster as first minister until her role in a botched heating scheme was \\"cleared up\\". Political talks will begin on Monday. Mrs Foster set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in 2012. It was designed to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to more environmentally friendly energy sources. But subsidies were overly generous and initially there was no cap on the payments. It later emerged the scheme was expected to cost the Northern Ireland tax payer £490m. Deputy First Minster Martin McGuinness, from Sinn Féin, resigned from his post in January after Mrs Foster rejected his calls for her to temporarily stand aside as first minister while an investigation into the scheme is carried out. His decision to quit led to a snap election which saw Sinn Féin increase its vote, cutting the DUP's lead to one seat. Mr Robinson told BBC 5Live's Stephen Nolan show: \\"I'm not ruling it out on the basis that if it was a decision for Arlene to take and one she made herself then the party would discuss that and consider it.\\" He added that it had been a \\"difficult election\\" and a \\"bad day for unionism\\". Mr Adams hailed the election result as a \\"watershed\\" moment but said Sinn Féin was making contact with all party leaders to discuss the return of power-sharing. He said the party's call for Mrs Foster to step aside during an investigation was \\"not a precondition\\" to Sinn Féin entering talks with the DUP. Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, unionists and nationalists must agree to share power for devolved government to function. \\"We have never said that Arlene Foster has to step aside before negotiations happen.  Arlene Foster is the leader of the DUP and we accept that absolutely,\\" Mr Adams told reporters. \\"The first position that we put to them [the DUP] was that Arlene Foster should stand aside until there was a preliminary report. \\"We're now being told that there's not going to be a preliminary report - where all this comes from, none of us know, the inquiry hasn't set out its mode of operation.\\" Mr Adams said the inquiry team \\"might decide that it could bring forward a preliminary report\\" or deal with the issues \\"in modular form\\", but added the inquiry could also take up to a year. He pointed to Mrs Foster's predecessor Peter Robinson, who stepped aside twice until to allow preliminary inquiries into allegations against him. \\"Our position is very, very straightforward.  We will not be consenting to Arlene Foster being the first minister until this issue is cleared up,\\" the Sinn Féin president said. There is now a three-week deadline for unionists and nationalists to form a power-sharing government. The Sinn Féin delegation will be led into talks on Monday by its northern leader, Michelle O'Neill. She said: \\"The task is not easy, but it is achievable if people come at it with the right attitude.\\" The nationalist SDLP also overtook the Ulster Unionist Party for the first time, meaning Stormont no longer has a unionist majority. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt announced he was stepping down as a result of his party's disappointing performance. If a government cannot be formed within the next three weeks, under law, another election will be called. Ultimately, if no power-sharing government is formed, devolved power could return to the UK parliament at Westminster for the first time in a decade. Secretary of State James Brokenshire said the election had demonstrated the desire by the overwhelming majority of voters for inclusive, devolved government. \\"Everyone now has a shared responsibility to engage intensively in the short period of time that is available to us, to ensure that a strong and stable administration is established,\\" he said. The BBC News NI website will carry all the latest on the election throughout the weekend.

The party's president, Gerry Adams, said Sinn Féin would not consent to Foster being the first minister \\"until this issue is cleared up\\".

Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. \\"The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school.\\" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: \\"The most dependable finding was that they were bored.\\" \\"They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations.\\" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit. In the U.S., only one state, New Mexico, has a law requiring teenagers to stay in high school until they graduate. Only four states: California, Tennessee, Texas and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, require school attendance until age 18, no exceptions. Jeffrey Grin, another researcher, says raising the compulsory attendance age may be one way to keep more kids in school. \\"As these dropouts look back, they realize they've made a mistake. And anything that sort of gives these people an extra push to stick it out and see it through to the end, is probably helpful measure.\\" New Hampshire may be the next state to raise its school attendance age to 18.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  A tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells (Figure 3.17b). Proteins hold the cells tightly against each other. This tight adhesion prevents materials from leaking between the cells. Tight junctions are typically found in the epithelial tissue that lines internal organs and cavities, and composes most of the skin. For example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining the urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking into the extracellular space. Also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells (Figure 3.17c). They keep cells together in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles. Gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate (Figure 3.17d).

These strategies might include, but are not limited to: 1. Implementing new policies or updating existing ones to address any gaps or vulnerabilities that were exposed by the incident. 2. Investing in training and educational resources to increase awareness and understanding of the factors that contribute to such incidents. 3. Establishing clear lines of communication and reporting mechanisms so that concerns and potential risks can be escalated and addressed in a timely manner. 4. Encouraging a culture of accountability and learning, where individuals and organizations are not afraid to recognize their mistakes and continuously work on improving their practices. 5. Strengthening cooperation and coordination among various stakeholders, including different departments within an organization, as well as external partners and industry peers, in an effort to share knowledge and best practices. Through these collaborative efforts, it is possible to create a safer and more secure environment in which the likelihood of similar incidents occurring is significantly reduced. The key to successfully preventing such incidents lies in fostering an ongoing commitment to improvement, learning from past errors, and continuously striving to identify and address potential risks. By embracing this approach, individuals and organizations can work together to ensure that the steps taken to address the issue are well-informed, effective, and sustainable in the long term."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When chocolate hardens, its melting point will end up being just a few degrees higher than the hardening temperature.When chocolate crystallizes at high temperatures, it forms a strong, dense crystalline structure that, texture-wise, is quite brittle. Most bought chocolate (baker's chocolate and chips) is already tempered, but when you melt it, you break down that crystalline structure, and if you harden it at room temperature then it ends up forming very weak crystals that will melt in your hand.If you use a special coating chocolate (couverture or the lower-quality compound chocolate) then you don't need to worry so much about tempering (although it's still a good idea), but if you use ordinary chocolate and don't temper it then your coating will end up being messy and wet and rub off on your hands while you eat it.

Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed \\"chief scientist,\\" he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize.

Snow chains are intended to help you gain traction in the wheels that push the vehicle. Depending on the application, that may be the front wheels, the rear wheels, or all four. Pick from:  1). Don't forget to consider your driving situation as well. If the trucks are small, there may be a back wheel and a front wheel with four..  2). When you've found the exact direction you'd like your snow chains to move, measure the vehicle's tire depth (km) and the truck's bore depth (km) through the road. Measure the surrounding area with a measuring tape and have the vehicle visual visually (through keyhole)..  3). Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual if you are unsure which wheels are the drive wheels. Front wheel drive cars (fwd) will use snow chains on the front wheels..  4). Drive wheels can be incredibly difficult to attach to the vehicle from the ground. If either way you can safely attach snow chains to the tires inside your car is to be selected..","output":"Once you have identified the drive wheels of your vehicle, follow these steps to install snow chains: 1. Prepare the snow chains: Lay out the chains on a flat surface to make sure there are no tangled or damaged links. If they're adjustable, ensure that they are set to the correct tire size. 2. Choose the correct type of snow chain according to your driving situation and the wheel type you have identified in the previous steps of the paragraph. 3. Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual for information on which wheels are the drive wheels. For front-wheel drive cars, you'll need to put snow chains on the front wheels. 4. If you are unsure about the tire and bore depth of your vehicle, measure them using a measuring tape. This will help you to install the snow chains properly. 5. Find a safe and level area to install the snow chains. Make sure the area around your vehicle is clear of any hazards or obstacles. 6. Turn off your car's engine and apply the parking brake for safety. You can also put on safety gear such as gloves and protective eyewear to avoid any injuries while installing the snow chains. 7. Begin installing the snow chains on the designated drive wheels. Start by sliding the chains behind the tire, and then bring the two ends of the chain together at the top of the tire. Connect the ends securely, making sure the chains are snug and centered on the tire tread. If your chains come with tensioners, you might want to consider using them for a more secure fit. 8. After you've installed the snow chains on one tire, move on to the next drive wheel and repeat the process.  9. Carefully drive forward a few feet after installing the chains on all drive wheels, and then stop and check to make sure they're still securely attached and properly adjusted. 10. Remember to adjust your driving behavior when using snow chains. Reduce your speed to avoid damaging your vehicle, the road, or the chains themselves. Additionally, avoid sudden turns or accelerations, and give yourself ample distance for braking. 11. Keep a close eye on the condition of the snow chains during your journey, and remove them as soon as you are driving on clear pavement. Leaving the chains on can potentially damage your vehicle and the road surface. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install snow chains on your vehicle and ensure a safer driving experience in snowy or icy conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As young Chinese increasingly forget how to write characters because they don't have to, using keyboards and touch screen technology on mobile phones is changing the trend.  For Yin Liang, a 26-year-old purchasing agent at a company, his embarrassment over forgetting how to write characters has gradually disappeared since he started to use the handwriting input method on his iPhone 4 a month ago.  \\"When you write on the touch screen, you use your finger, instead of a mouse or keyboard,\\" Yin says.  \\"Actually, your finger is like a pen, writing the complicated characters that have long been spelled by pinyin, an alphabet-based input system. Whether typing on computers or texting on phones, most users in China type by phonetically spelling out the sounds of the characters and the software then gives a menu of characters that fit the pronunciation, so users only need to recognize the character.  Handwriting technology on a mobile phone touch screen has been around for years and became popular with the iPhone, which recognizes the input and offers a wide selection of characters.  \\"It's efficient and accurate,\\" Yin says.  Chinese characters are the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world, but as pinyin-based typing has become more widespread, youths have started forgetting how to write out characters. This was one of the main topics for debate at the first Cross-Straits Chinese Character Art Festival, held recently in Beijing, which attracted experts from Taiwan and the mainland.  According to Zhang Zikang, president of the Culture and Art Publishing House, writing with a pen on the touch screen brings handwriting into the digital age. It is even better when you write with your finger, feeling the flow of the cursive script and the grace and art of Chinese characters, he says.  \\"Smart gadgets don't take life from the square-shaped characters, instead they offer a new and advanced platform to show the charm of Chinese characters, which are always evolving,\\" Zhang says.

Article: Contrary to people's previous knowledge, it's food shortage not dietary preference that motivates birds to migrate thousands of miles back and forth between breeding and nonbreeding areas each year, a new research shows. \\"It's not whether you eat insects,fruits or candy bars or where you eat them that counts,but how reliable that daytoday food source is,\\" said the study leader W.Alice Boyle of the University of Arizona. To figure out the underlying pressure that drives some birds to leave home for the season,Boyle examined 379 related species of New World flycatchers  and compared their sizes,food types, habitats, migratory behaviors and whether or not they fed in flocks. To compare the birds,the researchers constructed a \\"supertree\\"  showing the exact evolutionary relationships among different species. A computer analysis then determined whether a particular species was migratory because it ran in the \\"family\\" or whether something in the bird's environment was forcing it to leave each season.Boyle and her colleagues found that food shortage was the number one issue that predicted a species' migratory behavior. \\"Food availability is the underlying pressure, not diet and habitat,\\" Boyle said. An alternative strategy that the birds use to handle food shortage is to hunt in flocks, since a group is more likely to find a new source of food than an individual. \\"If you suffer from food shortage, you have two options,\\" Boyle said.\\"You can either hunt with other birds or you can migrate.\\" Question: For what purpose does the author write the text?

In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.\\"  Answer:","output":"Anyone can create a church in America because the First Amendment to the US Constitution ensures the separation of church and state and protects religious liberty. This is achieved through the establishment clause, which prevents the government from endorsing or supporting any particular religion, and the free exercise clause, which ensures individuals' freedom to practice their chosen religion without government interference.

Summarize this article: Media playback is not supported on this device Rooney, with 53 England goals in 119 appearances, left Manchester United to return to Everton this summer with his place in Old Trafford's history books also assured after he overtook Sir Bobby Charlton's club record with 253 goals. He had been sidelined by Jose Mourinho at United, and also by Southgate with England, but such has been his early rejuvenation at Goodison Park that he was offered a place back in the fold for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. Rooney, who originally planned to end his England career after next summer's World Cup in Russia, decided against a return and will now focus fully on Everton. So how will history judge Wayne Rooney's England career? Those of us fortunate to be in Portugal for the long, hot summer of Euro 2004 will remember the rise of this phenomenon and how Everton's 18-year-old became the most talked-about player at a tournament eventually won by rank outsiders Greece. Rooney had made his debut, and become England's youngest player at 17 years and 111 days, in a defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. But it was his deeds in Lisbon against France, where he gave an experienced defence a harrowing night in a 2-1 loss at the iconic Stadium of Light, as well as scoring twice against Switzerland and Croatia, that thrust him into the global spotlight. Media playback is not supported on this device Suddenly, the quiet youngster who played football from the streets was the name on everyone's lips. Calls to hotels and mobile phones were being fielded from around the world, seeking the story of the Croxteth boy who played in an untamed style that had suddenly transformed him into a superstar. As someone who attended the same De La Salle School in Liverpool, it was easier for me to paint a picture of his working-class background and the environment that had shaped his development - on the school playground in Carr Lane East and in junior sides before joining Everton. Rooney himself was largely protected from the mounting media attention, but his football did the talking. Phil Neville, a fellow England squad member at Euro 2004, recalls: \\"I remember when he first got into the squad - the youthfulness, the bravery, the courage he showed, particularly at his first major tournament in Portugal. \\"He was a breath of fresh air. No-one enjoyed playing for England more than Wayne Rooney.\\" This Euro 2004 episode ended in misery when Rooney broke his foot early in the quarter-final against Portugal, which England lost on penalties. Many felt England would have won that tournament had Rooney stayed fit, but he had made an indelible mark - life would never be the same as he embarked on an international career lived under intense personal and sporting scrutiny.

This vote closes at 1900 BST on Thursday, 24 August, and the result will be available on this page. Rooney's stratospheric rise in Portugal sent expectation through the roof, his unstoppable blend of power, awareness and potency in front of goal leaving England fans hoping they had finally found the talisman to end the years of frustration since the World Cup win of 1966. Sadly, this proved beyond not just him but a generation of world-class players such as Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Chelsea's Frank Lampard and the likes of Paul Scholes and David Beckham from Manchester United. The 'golden generation' could not reproduce their consistent success at club level once in England colours. Rooney's legacy will be coloured by his failure to make a mark on another major tournament. Not fully fit, he was sent off in another quarter-final defeat to Portugal at the 2006 World Cup, and was then the most obvious symbol of the frustrations felt inside the infamous 'Camp Capello' in South Africa in 2010. Manager Fabio Capello's decision to keep England's players miles off the beaten track - when they threw open their bedroom windows there would not have been the slightest clue they were in Africa - seemed to particularly affect Rooney, someone who did not apparently need or enjoy downtime. He described a typical day as \\"breakfast, training, lunch, dinner, bed\\", adding for good measure \\"there are only so many games of darts and snooker you can play\\". Rooney's dark mood surfaced as he shouted criticism of England's supporters into a television camera following a horrific goalless draw with Algeria in Cape Town before England were thrashed by Germany in the last 16. For all his effort - and you only had to listen to Rooney at close quarters to sense his desire and commitment - it simply never happened for him at another tournament. Rooney missed the start of Euro 2012 through suspension after being sent off in a qualifier in Montenegro and while he was actually one of England's better performers at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and at last summer's Euro 2016 in France, the abiding memory will be of abject humiliation on both occasions - failure to reach the knockout stage then a last-16 exit to Iceland. Rooney scored just one goal in 11 appearances at World Cup finals from 21 attempted shots. It is a telling statistic for him, and for England. The counterpoint to this is that only Gary Lineker (10) and Alan Shearer (nine) scored more than Rooney's seven goals for England at major tournaments. But it seemed the harder Rooney tried the more this success eluded him, and when his England career is examined, it will be through the prism of these let-downs - something that still hurts enough to warrant a mention in his retirement statement. And yet Sven-Goran Eriksson, the man who gave him his England debut, believes Rooney could have stayed on to make an impact at next summer's World Cup. In giving a glowing tribute to BBC World Service, the Swede said: \\"If he goes on playing like he is now, scoring goals for Everton, then he could still have been an important player. If I was England manager I would do everything to convince Rooney to play at the World Cup then make a decision.\\" And he recalled the player he worked with as he said: \\"I remember when training was finished Rooney didn't want to leave the training ground. He wanted to stay doing free-kicks, shooting etc. \\"He's tough, a great player, hard worker, has everything as a football player. He was mature at 17. I remember I told him the day before his debut for England that he was going to start he just said 'OK' like it was normal. It was not normal at 17.\\" Rooney's England record is in the books and cannot be erased - but he may just fall short of the status of \\"great\\" afforded to Sir Bobby Charlton, whose goals record he broke for Manchester United and his country. Charlton has an accolade shared by only 11 Englishmen, a World Cup winners' medal, while Rooney was perhaps a victim of his own stunning early success. But he will be recalled, certainly by those who have followed the England camp closely throughout his international career, as someone who was endlessly committed to his country. He was always the consummate team player, always willing to sacrifice his own needs and personal preferences if he thought it would achieve the desired result. As an example, he willingly shifted to the left-flank, unfamiliar territory, to accommodate the shock inclusion of Raheem Sterling against Italy in Manaus at the 2014 World Cup. Whenever the case was made for his exclusion, as it occasionally was, the counter-argument posed was whether England would be a better team without him. The answer was rarely yes. England team-mates spoke with almost unanimous respect for his presence inside the dressing room and on the field. He was, in dressing room parlance, a player's player. Rooney's work-rate was prodigious, often leading to him appearing in areas of the pitch where he was not at his most effective, but it was always done with the best of intentions, fuelled by an unquenchable desire to win - something that often caused his volatile temperament to boil over. Throughout all the years and managerial changes, as well as starting alongside 86 different players, Rooney was always regarded by Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson as the key member of their team. Time ran out under Gareth Southgate as Rooney struggled at Manchester United, but even he was ready to bring him back after his early excellence for Everton. And if respect among opposing players and managers is a measure of Rooney's stature, then it was also a running theme throughout his career that he was invariably the man they feared most in England's team. It is perhaps a sign of his selflessness that he has decided to bow out now rather than take the opportunity to close in on the seven more England caps he needed to pass goalkeeper Peter Shilton's record tally of 125 but it appears he has listened to his body and called it a day. \\"He's definitely the greatest goalscorer we've ever had,\\" said Neville. \\"I think he's made the right call for his career and probably made the right call for Gareth Southgate as well. He's gone out at the top and as England's greatest ever goalscorer - what a classy way to bow out from what's been a fabulous international career.\\" Of course, it is impossible to paint a glorious unblemished canvas of his England career, with two red cards and his role in squads that failed at major tournaments, but Rooney has a record that he can be justly proud of and can take his place in the Football Association's Hall Of Fame. Wayne Rooney is England's all-time record goalscorer - this is the immediate factual, historic legacy. And it may well be that in time Rooney might actually come to be regarded as under-rated and under-appreciated, his career finally being put in perspective away from the initial excitement. Rooney will hold his record for many years to come and one of those who may yet threaten it, Tottenham's Harry Kane, tweeted after his retreat from the international scene: \\"Wayne Rooney. An amazing player and goalscorer for England. A Three Lions Legend.\\" And Michael Owen, who shared those heady early days in Portugal in 2004 as Rooney's strike partner, responded to his decision with: \\"Brilliant timing. Always go out on top. Well done Wayne Rooney. An international career to be proud of.\\" Lineker, third in England's goal standings behind Rooney and Charlton, added: \\"England's highest ever goalscorer calls it a day. Congratulations to Wayne Rooney on a magnificent international career. A player's player.\\" Indeed, it was Lineker who described Rooney as \\"under-appreciated\\" after he scored in Everton's 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Monday, stating: \\"He'd be one of Britain's top 10 ever. He's had a marvellous career.\\" Neville now hopes the FA can let Rooney take one final England post-retirement bow when they face Slovakia at Wembley, saying: \\"I hope they get Wayne down to Wembley next Monday and he can stand on Wembley with England for the last time, the fans can applaud him, cheer him, thank him. \\"He can thank them and he can go down to Wembley with his wife and children and have one last goodbye.\\" He may not have played a part in ending England's so-called 'years of hurt' and there will always be an element of 'what might have been', but Rooney deserves great admiration and respect. He may have fallen short of the international greatness so many of us expected but he will be regarded as one of the finest players ever to represent England, a player who made history. That alone is tribute and testimony enough.","output":"Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has retired from international football after scoring 53 goals in 119 appearances for England. Rooney left Manchester United for Everton, and his strong performance there so far had prompted the offer of a place in the national team for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. Rooney originally intended to end his England career after the World Cup in Russia next summer, but has instead decided to concentrate exclusively on playing for Everton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To fully understand the sentiment, let's break the sentence down into its individual words and analyze their meanings and connotations. 1. \\"Incredibly\\": This adverb is used to emphasize the intensity or degree of a specific quality or characteristic. It may be interpreted as \\"to an extraordinary extent\\" or \\"very much so.\\" In this context, \\"incredibly\\" is strengthening the meaning of the subsequent word, \\"inane.\\" The use of \\"incredibly\\" as an intensifier indicates that the speaker has a strong feeling about the topic being referenced. 2. \\"Inane\\": This adjective refers to something that is empty of meaning, void of intellectual value or significance, or lacking sense or purpose. It is commonly used to describe ideas, actions, or statements that are considered silly, foolish, or absurd. The word has a negative connotation, suggesting disapproval or criticism on the part of the speaker. When these two words are combined in the sentence \\"incredibly inane,\\" the sentiment conveyed is a heightened level of negativity or criticism. The speaker is expressing an intense level of disapproval, as they view the subject matter as being extremely nonsensical, insignificant, or meaningless. In addition, the degree of negativity perceived by the reader or listener may also depend on the context in which the statement is made. For example, if the sentence is uttered in reference to a particular statement or action, it signals strong disapproval. Alternatively, if the sentence is used as a general comment without a specific reference, the sentiment may be perceived as more dismissive or disdainful. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"incredibly inane\\" is perceived as negative, disapproving, or critical, with the speaker expressing a strong sense of disdain or disapproval for something they deem to be highly senseless or insignificant. The context in which the sentence is used will further influence the exact interpretation of the sentiment by the reader or listener."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sir Joseph Rotblat  (4 November 1908 - 31 August 2005) was a Polish physicist, a self-described \\"Pole with a British passport\\". Rotblat worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project during World War II, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory after the war with Germany ended. His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. A signatory of the 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973, and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize \\"for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.\\" Rotblat returned to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting director of research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With the help of a Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczyslaw (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact that she was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.  Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan, and gave a series of public lectures in which he called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research. Rotblat was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends, and so became interested in the medical and biological uses of radiation. In 1949, he became Professor of Physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital (\\"Barts\\"), London, a teaching hospital associated with the University of London. He remained there for the rest of his career, becoming a professor emeritus in 1976. He received his PhD from Liverpool in 1950, having written his thesis on the \\"Determination of a number of neutrons emitted from a source\\". He also worked on several official bodies connected with nuclear physics, and arranged the Atom Train, a major travelling exhibition for schools on civil nuclear energy.  At St Bartholomew's, Rotblat worked on the effects of radiation on living organisms, especially on ageing and fertility. This led him to an interest in nuclear fallout, especially strontium-90 and the safe limits of ionising radiation. In 1955, he demonstrated that the contamination caused by the fallout after the Castle Bravo test at Bikini Atoll nuclear test by the United States would have been far greater than that stated officially. Until then the official line had been that the growth in the strength of atomic bombs was not accompanied by an equivalent growth in radioactivity released. Japanese scientists who had collected data from a fishing vessel, the Lucky Dragon, which had inadvertently been exposed to fallout, disagreed with this. Rotblat was able to deduce that the bomb had three stages and showed that the fission phase at the end of the explosion increased the amount of radioactivity by forty times. His paper was taken up by the media and contributed to the public debate that resulted in the ending of atmospheric tests by the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Why did he feel that way?","output":"Sir Joseph Rotblat felt betrayed by the use of atomic weapons against Japan and called for a three-year moratorium on all atomic research because he was determined that his research should have only peaceful ends.

Q:Information:  - A castle (from ) is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages by nobility. Scholars debate the scope of the word \\"castle\\", but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for nobility; and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence  though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.  - The Middle East is a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and Egypt. The corresponding adjective is \\"Middle-Eastern\\" and the derived noun is \\"Middle-Easterner\\". The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to Far East) beginning in the early 20th century.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a thin vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows.  - Lucerne (Lucerne Swiss-German: \\"Lozärn\\") is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name. With a population of about 81,057 people, Lucerne is the most populous town in Central Switzerland, and a nexus of economics, transportation, culture, and media of this region. The city's urban area consists of 17 municipalities and towns located in three different cantons with an overall population of about 250,000 people.  - \\"Country House\\" is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album \\"The Great Escape\\" on 14 August 1995. \\"Country House\\" was the first of two Blur singles to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart (the second being 1997's \\"Beetlebum\\").  - Meggen is a municipality in the district of Lucerne in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland.  - Mulhouse (Alsatian: \\"Milhüsa\\" or \\"Milhüse\\",  i.e. \\"mill house\\") is a city and commune in eastern France, close to the Swiss and German borders.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - The canton of Lucerne is a canton of Switzerland. It is located in the centre of Switzerland. The population of the canton (as of ) is . , the population included 57,268 foreigners, or about 15.8% of the total population. The cantonal capital is Lucerne.  - A palace is a grand residence, especially a royal residence, or the home of a head of state or some other high-ranking dignitary, such as a bishop or archbishop.  - Central Switzerland is the region of the Alpine foothills geographically the heart and historically the origin of Switzerland, with the cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Lucerne and Zug.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Flying for the holidays? Frequent fliers have some tips By Gary Stoller, USA TODAY To avoid congested roads and crowded airports, frequent traveler Rip Russell will fly home on Thanksgiving morning and fly back to his job in Russell, a production accountant working on a movie, says flying on those days to and from Atlanta shortens his holiday but reduces stress. \\"By traveling on the shoulders of these megapeak days, I'm far less likely to arrive stressed from the in-bound trip and the anticipation of the dreaded Sunday-after airport pressure cooker,\\" Russell says. About 24 million air travelers — nearly 4% more than last year — are expected to fly on U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, estimates the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers. Many travelers will be amateurs by the standards of Russell and other frequent fliers. They'll not have flown since this time last year or maybe two or three years ago, when planes and airports weren't as crowded as they'll be this month or next for the Christmas holiday. They lack the strategies that people who put in 50, 100 or more days on the road each year use to avoid hassles and stay cool, calm and collected while trying to get to their destinations. For those infrequent travelers, Russell and other frequent fliers from USA TODAY's panel of Road Warriors, who log millions of miles a year in the sky, offer some tips to ensure holidays aren't spoiled by the rigors of travel. Russell, for instance, suggests avoiding connecting flights on small regional jets in addition to avoiding peak travel days. Instead, he says, he drives the 2½ hours from Atlanta to his cabin in Waynesville, N.C. \\"I avoid the overpriced and cramped regional jet experience,\\" Russell says. \\"The cost savings is significant, and there are fewer headaches and opportunities for flight-related delays or lost luggage.\\" •Jeff Jones, a manager for a food industry manufacturer, says he books an early-morning flight, because airport traffic is lighter, and he has more flight options if his morning flight is canceled or delayed. He also checks in ahead of time online to avoid a wait at the airline counter. \\"I always allow more time for everything,\\" says Jones of Madison, Wis. \\"I double the amount of time I usually plan for getting through security.\\" •Christian Johnson, a vice president for a gaming company, says he books only non-stop flights. \\"Connections domestically are very difficult and unpredictable in the best of times,\\" says Johnson of Las Vegas. \\"During holidays, it's a crapshoot.\\" •Tony Goddard, COO of a company in West Seneca, N.Y., that manufactures equipment for the aviation industry, recommends that fliers without elite frequent-flier program privileges book higher-priced tickets. \\"If a flight is oversold or canceled, and you are fighting for a seat on the next available flight, a higher fare will put you much higher up on a standby list,\\" Goddard says. •Bob Bender, an architect in Lenexa, Kan., says holiday travelers should pack light but make sure necessary items such as prescription medicine and phone numbers are available if a flight is delayed. Bender and other frequent fliers advise travelers to not carry Christmas presents through security but instead ship them or put them in checked bags. Security screeners at passenger checkpoints \\"like boxes that are wrapped,\\" Bender says. Maybe the most important advice, some veteran travelers say, is to be at ease and have a positive mind-set when navigating through even the most crowded of airports, such as Atlanta's Hartsfield or Chicago's O'Hare, the nation's two busiest, respectively. \\"Relax and give yourself time to take in the displays that most large airports have available,\\" Bender says. \\"Atlanta has a great display of African art in the tunnel under the concourses. Chicago has the airplane flown by Lt. Cmdr. Edward O'Hare. And Denver has a great art display on the bridge between the main terminal and Concourse A.\\" Kevin Korterud, a consultant in New Albany, Ohio, says he enjoys flying just before Thanksgiving. \\"I feel a collective experience with so many people headed to destinations anticipating happy times,\\" he says.

Summarize: Great Britain captain Andrew Sullivan hit 22 points for Leicester and was named most valuable player, while team-mate TrayVonn Wright added 20. The Eagles came back from 17 points down in the third quarter to tie, only for Leicester to finish the stronger. Rahmon Fletcher led Newcastle's scoring with 18 points. Leicester had never won the Trophy in five final appearances, but they made the better start, racing into an 18-7 lead with nine points from guard Tyler Bernardini. Newcastle levelled the game at 26-26 in the middle of the second quarter only for Sullivan and Wright to give the Riders to a 42-30 half-time advantage, scoring six and five points each in the process. Leicester extended their advantage in the third quarter with threes from Wright and Jamall Anderson before the Eagles threatened a repeat of January's Cup final comeback with a flurry of threes from Fletcher, Charles Smith, Drew Lasker and Joe Chapman. The sides were level 72-72 with just under four minutes remaining, but in contrast to the Cup final, Leicester produced the killer touch. Baskets from Sullivan, Bernardini and Trevor Gruis started the 13-4 run that won the game and ended Newcastle's hopes of repeating last year's clean sweep of all four major titles. Leicester Riders coach Rob Paternostro: \\"Offensively we made better decisions, but before the game I said to the guys 'it's got to be defence that wins it for us' and I think our defence was better today. \\"We held them to 77 points today and that really gave us a chance to win - it was important.\\" Newcastle player-coach Fab Flournoy: \\"They had a good game plan coming in - I think it took us a while to get things going in the first half,\\" he said. \\"In the second half we settled into the game a little better but by that time they already had their rhythm and it was like trying to stop a freight train.\\" Summary:","output":"In the BBL Trophy final, Great Britain captain Andrew Sullivan's outstanding performance led the Leicester Riders to victory over the Newcastle Eagles. Sullivan scored 22 points and was honored as the most valuable player, with teammate TrayVonn Wright contributing 20 points. Despite a 17-point comeback by the Eagles in the third quarter, Leicester managed to secure the win, marking their first Trophy victory in five final appearances. Leicester's strong start was attributed to an 18-7 lead initiated by Tyler Bernardini with nine points. Although Newcastle leveled the game at 26-26 during the second quarter, Sullivan and Wright regained the advantage for the Riders, leading to a 42-30 score at halftime. The third quarter witnessed an increased lead for Leicester, as well as a commendable comeback attempt by the Eagles, ultimately resulting in a tied score of 72-72 with under four minutes remaining. Leicester, however, clinched the victory with a final 13-4 run. Leicester Riders coach Rob Paternostro emphasized the importance of defense in securing their victory, holding the Eagles to a mere 77 points.

Hypothesis: St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK based on the context provided. Here is a detailed analysis supporting this hypothesis: Firstly, the context presents two different football clubs that share the same name - St. Ives Town F.C. We can identify them by their geographical locations: 1. St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England: One St. Ives Town F.C. is based in St Ives, a market town in Cambridgeshire, England. It is mentioned that this team competes in the Southern League Premier Division. 2. St Ives, Cornwall, England: The other St. Ives Town F.C. is located in St Ives, a seaside town in Cornwall, England. This team participates in the Cornwall Combination, which is a regional football competition. It is important to note that both Cambridgeshire and Cornwall are counties in England, which is a constituent country of the United Kingdom (UK). The UK is formed by the union of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Given that both football clubs are based in England, we can safely hypothesize that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK. Moreover, as both teams play in different leagues, the context also suggests that these clubs are distinguished from each other based on their geographical locations within the UK, despite sharing the same name. In conclusion, based on the context provided, it is reasonable to derive the hypothesis that St. Ives Town F.C. has traditionally been in the UK, as both football clubs with this name are located in England, a country that forms part of the United Kingdom."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Choices:  - soluble  - unbreakable  - horizontal  - ionic  A: Answer:","output":"Ionic An ionic bond generally forms between a metal and non-metal. To better understand why this is the case, it is essential to first comprehend the basics behind ionic bonding. Ionic bonding occurs when atoms transfer electrons from one another to attain a full outer shell of valence electrons and become more stable. Metals, which are found on the left side of the periodic table, tend to lose electrons to achieve stability, as they typically have one to three electrons in their outer shell. Non-metals, which are found on the right side of the periodic table, tend to gain electrons, as they have a more significant number of valence electrons and require fewer electrons to complete their outer shell. When a metal loses an electron, it forms a positively charged ion called a cation. On the other hand, when a non-metal gains an electron, it forms a negatively charged ion called an anion. This transfer of electrons creates an electrostatic attraction between these charged ions, which is called an ionic bond. To illustrate this, consider the example of sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a classic example of an ionic compound formed between a metal (sodium, Na) and a non-metal (chlorine, Cl). Sodium has one electron in its outer shell, while chlorine has seven. The sodium atom donates one electron to the chlorine atom, resulting in a positively charged sodium ion (Na+) and a negatively charged chloride ion (Cl-). The ionic bond between these ions holds them together and forms a crystal lattice structure. In summary, ionic bonds typically occur between metals and non-metals due to the transfer of electrons, forming charged ions that are attracted to each other. This type of bonding is responsible for the formation of various compounds, which possess unique physicochemical properties. Among the given choices, \\"Ionic\\" is the correct answer to the question of what type of bond generally forms between a metal and a non-metal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sandman (Wesley Dodds) is a fictional character, a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first of several DC characters to bear the name Sandman, he was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Bert Christman. Attired in a green business suit, fedora, and gas mask, the Sandman used a gun emitting a sleeping gas to sedate criminals. He was originally one of the mystery men to appear in comic books and other types of adventure fiction in the 1930s but later was outfitted with a unitard/cowl costume and developed into a proper superhero, acquiring sidekick Sandy, and founding the Justice Society of America. Dodds is one of a number of Justice Society members who finds themselves in the \\"Ragnarok Dimension\\" during the early Modern Age of comic books. The Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special (1986) wrote the post-Crisis tale of a time-warped wave of destruction ready to engulf the world. Dodds and his JSA teammates enter into a limbo to engage in an eternal battle that would allow the universe to continue its existence. This was later revealed to be a simulation created by Odin, which he intended to give to Dream as a bribe. Dodds, Dream's protege, and Hawkman, the grandfather of Dream's appointed successor are the only JSA members we see at this time. This lasted only until 1992 when DC published Armageddon: Inferno. This mini-series ended with the JSA members leaving limbo and entering the 'real' world. Justice Society of America (1992-1993) showed how the JSA members handled returning to normal life. For the Sandman, the series depicted him as an old, thin man with a balding scalp and a sharp wit. Starting with issue #1 his physical condition became important as writer Len Strazewski had him suffer a stroke at the first sign of a villainous attack. Both his age and his physical limitations became a theme writers would use in this character's post-Crisis stories.  During Zero Hour, Dodds is returned to his proper age by the Extant. Later, Wesley Dodds is shown as retired and living with Dian Belmont though occasionally coming out of it, most notably in a team-up with Jack Knight, the son of Dodds' JSA teammate Starman. When Dian is diagnosed with a terminal disease, the two travel the world together until her death.  Towards the end of his life, Dodds' prophetic dreams alert him to the identity and location of the new Doctor Fate, prompting him to contact the Gray Man, a being created from the residue of others' dreams, as well as his old friend Speed Saunders to instruct them to warn his former teammates about what he has discovered. Waiting on a clifftop, he is subsequently confronted by the powerful villain Mordru, who intends to force Dodds to tell him the identity of the new Doctor Fate, only for Dodds to distract Mordru with his gas-gun long enough to commit suicide by jumping off the cliff rather than allow Mordru to torture him into submission. His last thoughts were that his final slumber would be free of nightmares as he is reunited with Dian. His youthful but now grown-up sidekick, Sandy the Golden Boy, becomes known simply as Sand and takes his mentor's place as a member of the Justice Society of America as well as his prophetic dreams. Eventually, he takes the name of Sandman.

Here is a news article: CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Shamba the lion was the star attraction at the Marakele Animal Sanctuary, giving tourists in the park's safari vehicles an up-close-and-personal view.      On Saturday, he was lured away from the gate to his enclosure by a staff member. The distraction was meant to help park owner, 72-year-old Mike Hodge, open the gate to exit the park. It was described as a routine precaution, but on that day, it was anything but.      Mike Hodge Marakele Animal Sanctuary      Suddenly, Hodge frantically ran back to the vehicle, as Shamba chased after him. Then the lion pounced and dragged him into the bushes.      Shocked and terrified tourists screamed for help as the male lion mauled Hodge. Eventually, shots rang out, and at the end of the ordeal, Shamba was killed to save Hodge's life.      Hodge was airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital, where he is being treated for severe lacerations and a broken jaw. His family said they are devastated by the loss of 10-year-old Shamba, who was hand-reared and bottle fed as a cub by Hodge, like many other animals at the sanctuary.      The incident has once again raised concerns about the ethics of breeding lions in captivity. Critics say they become used to humans, but at the end of the day they are still wild animals. ||||| Update | The owner of an animal sanctuary in Limpopo, South Africa, was attacked by a lion on Saturday in an incident that left the man needing medical attention.

Mike Hodge was pounced on by the lion as he tried to leave through a gate. Video footage showed him being dragged off towards bushes.      Onlookers could be heard screaming during the incident at Marakele animal sanctuary in Thabazimbi.      It was reported that Hodge entered the lion’s enclosure over concerns about a smell in the compound that was bothering it.      A South African police spokesman, Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, told News24 that Hodge had sustained injuries to his neck and jaw in the incident on Monday.      “The owner was immediately taken to hospital with serious injuries. He is currently recuperating,” he said.      The animal park’s website says Mike and Chrissy Hodge moved to South Africa from the UK in 1999 and opened their lion project in 2003.

Now, we combine these terms by adding the coefficients: -3 - 12 = -15 So, the equation becomes: -15*d = 75 Step 2: Solve for d Now we need to isolate the variable 'd' to find its value. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of d, which is -15: -15*d / -15 = 75 / -15 Now, divide: d = -5 So, the solution to the equation -3*d - 12*d = 75 is d = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.

Information:  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - William M. Kelso, C.B.E., Ph. D., F.S.A. (born 1941), often referred to as Bill Kelso, is an American archaeologist specializing in Virginia's colonial period, particularly the Jamestown colony.  - The Virginia Company refers collectively to two joint stock companies chartered by James I on 10 April 1606 with the purposes of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. The two companies, called the \\"Virginia Company of London\\" (or the London Company) and the \\"Virginia Company of Plymouth\\" (or Plymouth Company) operated with identical charters but with differing territories. An area of overlapping territory was created within which the two companies were not permitted to establish colonies within one hundred miles of each other. The Plymouth Company never fulfilled its charter, and its territory that later became New England was at that time also claimed by England.  - The Colony of Virginia (also known frequently as the Virginia Colony, the Province of Virginia, and occasionally as the Dominion and Colony of Virginia or His Majesty's Most Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia) was the first permanently settled English colony in North America. Newfoundland, with seasonal settlements, had been established as a colony by Royal Charter in 1583. American archaeologist William Kelso says Virginia \\"is where the British Empire began ... this was the first colony in the British Empire.\\" The colony existed briefly during the 16th century, and then continuously from 1607 until the American Revolution (as a British colony after 1707). The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed \\"The Old Dominion\\" by King Charles II for its perceived loyalty to the English monarchy during the era of the Commonwealth of England.  - Christopher Newport (15611617) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the \\"Susan Constant\\", the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the \\"Godspeed\\" and the \\"Discovery\\".  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Whose successor created two additional hierarchical posts and added 16 more prebendary canons?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The dignitaries and canons constituted the chapter and had the primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter being led by the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rulebook of St Benedict was read before the business of the day was discussed. Bishop Brice's chapter of eight clerics consisted of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andrew de Moravia, greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendary canons. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created by the time of Andrew's death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de Moravia family, of which Bishop Andrew was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.Rural Deans, or deans of Christianity as they were known in the Scottish Church, supervised the priests in the deaneries and implemented the bishop's edicts. There were four deaneries in the Moray diocese—Elgin, Inverness, Strathspey and Strathbogie, and these provided the income not only for the cathedral and chapter but also for other religious houses within and outside the diocese. Many churches were allocated to support designated canons, and...

The brand, which carved a niche for itself in the realm of high-end fashion, found itself in a financial turmoil, ultimately leading to its collapse. Loyal patrons, who invested in the label based on the credibility of the stars that publicly supported it, are now voicing their discontent and seeking answers. Background The celebrity-backed label's journey began with the intention of revolutionizing the fashion industry. The brand had its sights set on setting a new bar for quality, design, and style, and managed to garner attention from high-profile personalities. These notable figures not only endorsed the label but also flaunted their latest collections, contributing to a rapid rise in the brand's popularity. With sales soaring, the brand appeared on track for continued success; however, this was merely a mirage. Financial Struggles & Collapse Despite the support from a roster of celebrities, the brand was unable to sustain its initial success. The growing financial struggles, including steep manufacturing costs, unrealistic pricing, and intense competition, began to take a toll on the business. Reports have also suggested the possible mismanagement of funds, which exacerbated the situation. The brand's shocking bankruptcy has been met with exasperation by fans and customers who invested a significant amount of money in this now-defunct label. Apart from being unable to use the products they paid for, customers are feeling all the more aggrieved due to the involvement of celebrities who had led them to believe in the brand's promise. Customers' Reactions & the Role of Celebrities Given the financial turmoil the brand has found itself in, many customers feel deceived by these celebrities who'd endorsed the label. Questions are being raised about whether the stars who flaunted the label were aware of its precarious financial situation, and if they inadvertently influenced their fans to make ill-advised purchases. Some customers even demand that celebrities be held accountable for the financial losses they have incurred, as they based their decisions on the celebrity endorsements. The celebrity-supported label's demise serves as a reminder to consumers about the importance of exercising caution when making purchasing decisions. Evaluating a brand based on its merits, rather than relying solely on celebrity endorsements, is crucial to avoid potential disappointment. In the meantime, the fashion label's customers have been left fuming, and the industry is abuzz with discussions about the downfalls of celebrity-driven marketing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I loved their large windows and just sat there on the floor looking out just admiring the lights and traffic etc. Yeah I'm weird like that. My dog sat with me which was kind of funny since I thought she might not like the height we were at. It was really packed with people down on the strip and there were a lot of hotel room parties going on. Walls are kind of thin or they just had the music way loud. Then again, they seemed to be talking in normal tones, but you could hear the majority of their conversations, which I particularly didn't like.   The service was good and the rooms were cleanly compared to other places I've been to. This was my second trip to Vegas with my family in years. I didn't go into the casino area since I was underage at the time and spent most of the night with my camera outside taking pictures along the strip. That was actually pretty nice. There were a lot of the people handing out cards and the sidewalk was littered with them.   Anyways, going off topic but the beds were very comfortable and I think we had room service cause everywhere we went was packed and we didn't want to deal with it. The food was good and service was prompt. I somehow missed the fireworks, but they probably had a decent view lol. I was just really happy that they allowed dogs. We didn't want to leave her alone at home while we were going to be away for a couple days. So they saved us from a disaster. :) Is this review positive or negative?

Information:  - The Criminal Code or Code criminel is a law that codifies most criminal offences and procedures in Canada . Its official long title is \`\` An Act respecting the criminal law '' ( R.S.C. 1985 , c. C - 46 , as amended ) . Section 91 ( 27 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 establishes the sole jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law in Canada . The Criminal Code contains some defences , but most are part of the common law rather than statute . Important Canadian criminal laws not forming part of the code include the Firearms Act , the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act , the Canada Evidence Act , the Food and Drugs Act , the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the Contraventions Act .  - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - The Constitution Act, 1867 (originally enacted as The British North America Act, 1867, and referred to as the BNA Act), is a major part of Canada's Constitution.

The first Latin American Pope may have been a Latin Lover first it emerged last night after a childhood sweetheart claimed she may have driven him into the church. Amalia Damonte, 76, who grew up in the same Flores neighbourhood of Buenos Aires as Bergoglio said she was shocked when he became Pope. 'I froze in front of the television. I couldn’t believe that Jorge was the Pope!' said his old girlfriend, now a white-hair pensioner with spectacles. Scroll down for video. Amalia Damonte, who Pope Francis proposed to as a 12-year-old. They were childhood sweethearts in Buenos Aires. It was either 1948 or 1949 when the future Pope wrote her a letter declaring he would like to marry her. 'We were 12, 13 years old. No more than that,' she said. 'He was wonderful. He was a proper guy.' 'There was only one letter and it cost me a smack in the face from my father,' she said. Pope Francis celebrates his inaugural Mass with cardinals inside the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican yesterday. The Pope used to play on the streets with Amalia and proposed marriage in letter at 12. Bergoglio decided to take religious orders in 1958 when he was 21 but he wasn't ordained until 1969. Today at 11:00am in the Clementine Hall he will meet with the full College of Cardinals, electors and non-electors, in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace. On Saturday at 11:00am in the Paul VI Hall, the Pope will hold an audience with accredited journalists (permanent and temporary) and those who work in the media. On Sunday, 17 March at 12:00pm, he will recite the first Angelus of his papacy from the papal apartments overlooking St. Peter's Square, as is customary. 'It said we were going to get married and I am going to buy you a white house. So the two of us could live together.' 'He said that if I didn’t say yes, he. would have to become a priest. Luckily for him, I said no!' said Ms. Damonte, who stills lives four doors up from Bergoglio's childhood home. 'He had a crush on me, you know. We. used to play on the streets here. It was a quiet neighbourhood then,. and, well, he was very nice.' She said she the he 'is a good man, the son of a working-class family,' she said. 'I hope he can achieve all the good that he holds in his heart.' It is quite possible that Ms Damonte wasn’t the only love in his life, despite what the future Pope told her. In a 2010 interview, he admitted he. had a girlfriend with whom he loved to dance the tango - probably not a. pastime for a 12-year-old. He said: ‘She was one of a group of friends with whom I used to go dancing with. ‘Then I discovered my religious vocation’. Bergoglio decided to take religious orders in 1958 when he was 21 but he wasn’t ordained until 1969. Youth: Jorge Mario Bergoglio (right) posing with two school teammates at the Technical School in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In this undated picture Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, second from left in back row, poses for a picture with his famil. This early 1950s picture released by journalist Sergio Rubin shows Jorge Mario Bergoglio posing with unidentified schoolmates of a preparatory school in Buenos Aires. He  was born into a middle-class family of seven in 1936, his father a railway worker and his mother a housewife. He became a priest at 32, nearly a decade after losing a lung due to respiratory illness and quitting his chemistry studies. Despite his late start, he was leading the local Jesuit community within four years, holding the post from 1973 to 1979. The new Pope is an ardent fan of an Argentinian football team nicknamed the 'Saints.' Just in case their rivals were in any doubt, the club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, tweeted a photo of Pope Francis with the team's colours yesterday. The Buenos Aires club  - one of the country's top sides - owes its name to a Catholic priest who played a key role in helping the 104-year-old team find a place to play in its early days. Father Lorenzo Massa became so worried about the boys kicking a ball around in the streets he offered them the use of the churchyard after seeing one player almost knocked down by a tram. There was just one condition - that they must attend mass on Sundays. In honour of his contribution, the founding members of the club decided to name the team after the churchman. Almagro is the district in Buenos Aires where the team originated from. The club now plays in the Primera Division, the top league in Argentina. The former home of the father of Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Portacomaro Stazione, Asti. The villa is tucked away among the vineyards in the gentle rolling hills of northern Italy. Highlights:","output":"1. The first Latin American Pope, whose name is Jorge and was known as Bergoglio when he was young, might have been in love before he decided to join the church.  2.

When they were kids, around 12 or 13 years old, Jorge wrote a letter to Amalia saying he wanted to marry her and live in a white house together.  4. But Amalia said no to him and he later decided to become a priest when he was 21 years old.  5. Jorge was officially made a priest in 1969, and he later became Pope.

Then we've got twists like this film has. Twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. This film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist. Three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. They end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher. This film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing). Plot holes are abundant here. The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? Did he have a one seater? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script.

Trivia question: According to the New Testament, shortly after the resurrection Jesus appeared to two disciples and took supper with them at which town north of Jerusalem?

According to the New Testament, shortly after the resurrection, Jesus appeared to two disciples and took supper with them at the town of Emmaus, which is located north of Jerusalem. This story can be found in the Gospel of Luke, in chapter 24, verses 13-35. The two disciples were traveling from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection, discussing the recent events that had taken place. As they walked, Jesus joined them, but they did not recognize him at first. Jesus asked them about their conversation, and they recounted the crucifixion and the report of Jesus' empty tomb. Jesus then began to interpret the Scriptures for them, explaining the prophecies concerning the Messiah and how they had been fulfilled. As they reached Emmaus, the disciples urged the stranger (Jesus) to stay with them, as it was getting late. At supper, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples. At that moment, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him as Jesus. However, he vanished from their sight immediately. The disciples, astonished by the encounter, returned to Jerusalem to share their experience with the other apostles. This event is known as the \\"Road to Emmaus\\" and is commemorated in Christian liturgy and art. It carries a message of hope, as well as an invitation for all believers to recognize Jesus' presence in their lives, especially through the breaking of bread, which later became a central part of Christian worship in the form of the Eucharist or Holy Communion."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians'   recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined   by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \\"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \\"wearied brain tissue\\". Children and \\"clever\\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \\"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\\" the authors write.

Translate to French","output":"La table des matières pour cette séance est donnée à la fin du compte rendu in extenso. Let's break down how this English phrase is translated into French: 1. \\"The contents page\\" - This is translated to \\"La table des matières\\". In French, a table of contents in a book or document is often referred to as \\"la table des matières\\". 'La' is the definite article equivalent to 'the' in English, 'table' means table, 'des' is a preposition that can be translated as 'of the' in this context, and 'matières' translates into 'matters' or 'subjects' but in the context of a book or a document, it refers to the topics or chapters, hence 'contents'.     2. \\"for this sitting\\" - This phrase is translated to \\"pour cette séance\\". 'Pour' is the French word for 'for', 'cette' is a demonstrative adjective meaning 'this' and 'séance' is a feminine noun meaning 'sitting' which can refer to a period of time spent doing a particular activity, often in a formal or organized way as in a meeting or a session. 3. \\"is given\\" - The translation in French would be \\"est donnée\\". 'Est' is the third person singular form of the verb 'être' (to be) in the present tense. 'Donnée' is the female singular form of the participle past of the verb 'donner' (to give) referring to 'la table des matières' which is feminine. 4. \\"at the end\\" - This phrase translates to \\"à la fin\\". 'À' is the French word for 'at', 'la' is the definite article 'the' and 'fin' translates into 'end'. 5. \\"of the verbatim report\\" - This is translated to \\"du compte rendu in extenso\\". 'Du' is a contraction of the preposition 'de' ('of') and the definite article 'le' ('the') and is used before masculine singular nouns. 'Compte rendu' is a masculine noun meaning 'report' and 'in extenso' is a Latin phrase used in French to mean 'in full' or 'verbatim'. Therefore, 'du compte rendu in extenso' translates into 'of the verbatim report'.     Therefore, the translation of \\"The contents page for this sitting is given at the end of the verbatim report.\\" into French is \\"La table des matières pour cette séance est donnée à la fin du compte rendu in extenso.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: \\"This is just the first stage in an opening up of the Tube network to become 24 hours. \\"For 150 years, the Tube has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city.\\" But are others equally as positive? No matter how this is dressed up by Boris Johnson and his officials, today's announcement is all about slashing almost Â£250 million from the annual London transport budget and the proposed cuts will decimate staffing levels and hit the most vulnerable users of Tube services the hardest. \\"RMT's position remains the same. We will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action, later today. FSB London welcomes the new 24 hours Tube service at weekends and improvements to the reliability, capacity and accessibility of Tube services. London is a 24-hr international city and it should have a transport infrastructure to support the night time small business economy. However, whilst the 24-hour Tube service is a much-needed step forward, more needs to be done to address the problem of road congestion and the state of repair of roads in London. We are horrified at London Underground's dangerous plans to cut staff from Tube stations. Thousands of disabled and older passengers rely on station staff to help us travel safely and independently. Many of us - particularly visually impaired people and those with a learning impairment - simply cannot use ticket machines. When we first established the West End Commission at the start of this year, one of the major recommendations that came through was to run the Tube at later times at the weekend. We are delighted that our work with businesses, Peter Hendy, and the TfL team has now made that a reality. The West End Partnership may be in its infancy but we are already getting results that will benefit the entire West End of London. Later tubes = great. Closure of all ticket offices?! Idiocy of the highest order. London is a modern, global city and it is only right that we should have a transport system that reflects this. We support the work that TfL has done in putting in place plans to extend the Tube which will further help us compete with other major cities. The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted.","output":"London Mayor Boris Johnson's announcement of a 24-hour Tube service on weekends has been met with mixed reactions, with some welcoming the move for supporting the night time economy while others criticize it for cutting staff and impacting vulnerable passengers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Strangled to death Answer:","output":"Title: The Whispering Strings Logline: Gianni, a renowned but secret criminal underworld violinist, finds himself entangled in a web of lies, deceit, and betrayal when a prized violin's whispered secrets lead to his ultimate demise. Plot: The film opens in a beautiful, old Italian villa outside Rome where we find Gianni practicing his beloved violin with unparalleled passion. However, the story quickly takes a sinister turn as the violin hums a secret melody that only a select few, including Gianni, know to be a message from the criminal underworld. The message reveals a vital meeting that will occur later that evening. Desperate to keep his true identity hidden, Gianni conspires with his trusted confidante, Marcello, to forge a false alibi for his whereabouts tonight. As the night unfolds, the mysterious meeting divulges an elaborate plan to steal a priceless violin known as 'The Whispering Strings', rumored to contain hidden secrets capable of altering the balance of power in the criminal world. Gianni, fascinated by the legend, decides to go against his associates and intercept the theft to possess the rare violin himself. With the help of a cunning thief named Sofia, they successfully steal the violin right under the noses of their criminal comrades. As word spreads about the missing violin, so do rumors about Gianni's betrayal. Struggling to return to his normal life, he becomes consumed by the violin's mesmerizing whispers. Unbeknownst to him, Marcello, fearing the whispers' tantalizing allure, devises a plan to reclaim the violin, even if it means sacrificing Gianni's life. As the pressure of being discovered as the mastermind behind the heist builds and rifts amongst Gianni's underworld peers grow increasingly dark, Marcello manipulates Sofia into discovering Gianni and the Whispering Strings. In a twisted act of treachery, she reveals Gianni's whereabouts to Marcello and their associates. In the film's horrifying climax, Gianni becomes the orchestrator of his own demise when he plays a chilling swan song on the Whispering Strings, accidentally unraveling the final secret held within the instrument - instructions on how to strangle a man. Unbeknownst to him, his betrayers stand nearby, listening intently. In the final moments of the film, the haunting melody of the Whispering Strings lingers in the air as their deadly secrets are enacted upon Gianni, who is mercilessly strangled to death, the hands of his once trusted friends grappling tight around his throat. The Whispering Strings fall silent as Gianni takes his final breath. The film concludes with Marcello gaining possession of the violin, only to realize that the very betrayal he orchestrated led not to ultimate power, but to the tragic loss of the one man who truly understood the agony behind the instrument's melodious whispers. The film's haunting, melancholic score echoes as the screen fades to black, leaving audiences captivated and distraught."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As a huge fan of horror films, especially J-horror and also gore i thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and didn't even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying, and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? The acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it. I did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both pretty unexplained, or perhaps i missed it as my mind couldn't understand what i was actually seeing. I appreciate the way it was supposed to be; shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing?)certainly were, i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way, they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends, but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value, but don't be expecting a dark, deeply scary and horrifying film; you'll just be disappointed.

Summarize the following: Sit in the driver’s seat and step down hard on the clutch pedal a few times. When you press down on the pedal, it should move smoothly and spring up right each time. If you’re having a hard time moving the pedal with any consistency, then the clutch fluid level has likely run low. It could also be from air getting into the clutch fluid reservoir.  The fluid lubricates the clutch so it responds when you use it to control the car’s speed. Without it, the mechanical components wear out at a much faster rate. Air bubbles prevent the clutch from engaging properly and are often caused by leaks. If you have replaced the clutch fluid recently, that could also cause air to get into the reservoir. Starting with the car in first gear, press down on the clutch to build up speed. Press it again when the engine reaches about 2,000 RPM and shift into second gear. Watch for anything out of the ordinary, such as the vehicle lurching, a stuck clutch, or a grinding noise. Visit a mechanic right away to solve most of these problems.  For something like a stuck clutch, check the fluid level first. A drained reservoir will prevent the clutch from working. Transmission problems are very serious and difficult to repair at home. Don’t ignore signs like grinding gears or a clutch that won’t work at all. . Fresh clutch fluid has a clear yellow coloring. It darkens, turning red or black, over time. If the fluid looks dirty, bleed it from the clutch valve underneath your vehicle. If it still looks clear, simply top off the reservoir tank as needed with new fluid.  Bleeding the valve requires you to jack up the vehicle’s front end and get under it. Once you find the valve, you attach a rubber hose to it and press the clutch to drive out the fluid. However, keep the tank full by adding new fluid after every couple of presses.  If you’re uncertain about doing this on your own, contact a mechanic to have them deal with the clutch fluid. Jacking up a car is dangerous when it isn’t done properly. Like any other car parts, the components responsible for operating the clutch wear out over time. Open the engine bay and examine the clutch fluid reservoir. Have a friend press the clutch pedal down while you keep an eye on the fluid level. Check the reservoir tank and the parts around it for leaked fluid.  If you notice a leak, get an identical replacement part or take the vehicle to a professional right away. You may not notice small leaks right away. One easy way to spot hidden leaks is by noting the fluid level, then checking it again after several days. If it has changed by a noticeable amount, then your vehicle needs repairs. The slave cylinder is a small component located above the transmission on your engine. To find it, follow the cables running from the clutch reservoir to the engine. Have a friend press the clutch pedal a few times while you watch for the slave cylinder to move. Check it for leaks or bubbles as well.  If the cylinder doesn’t move, it has to be replaced. Take the vehicle to a mechanic. Leaks can be fixed by replacing parts. Have a mechanic do it if you are unable to do it on your own. If you do it on your own, you will need to bleed out the clutch valve afterward. Summary:","output":"To check and maintain your vehicle's clutch, start by sitting in the driver's seat and pressing the clutch pedal a few times, ensuring it moves smoothly and springs back consistently. Difficulty in doing so might indicate low clutch fluid levels or air in the reservoir. The clutch fluid is essential for lubricating the components and preventing premature wear. Regularly examine the fluid reservoir, checking for any leaks and the fluid's color, as darkened fluid should be replaced. To bleed the fluid, safely jack up the vehicle's front end and attach a rubber hose to the clutch valve. Press the clutch to drive out the fluid, adding new fluid to the tank between presses. If uncertain about this process, seek assistance from a mechanic. Remember to inspect the slave cylinder for leaks or bubbles and ensure it moves when the clutch pedal is pressed. If it doesn't move, replace it at a mechanic. Address any leaks by replacing parts or seeking professional help. After fixing the issues, bleed the clutch valve to ensure your vehicle's clutch operates optimally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Pretending to be happy can actually make you more miserable--especially if you're a woman, according to a new study. Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive.    The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire  . He said:\\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\\"    Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\\"faked smiles\\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:\\"Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.\\"Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period.    The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional displays over a period of time and compare the different effects that they have on men and women. His team examined the effects of\\"surface acting\\"--or fake smiling--compared to what was termed\\"deep acting\\", or cultivating positive emotions by recalling pleasant memories. Dr. Scott said: \\"Women were harmed more by'surface acting', meaning their moods worsened even more than men and they withdrew more from work. However , they were helped more by'deep acting',which meant their moods improved more.\\" Dr. Scott suggested women tended to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they were expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while they are feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings. Although,\\"deep acting\\"seemed to improve moods in the short term, Dr....

Question: who becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence? Movie plot title: Solaris Movie plot: Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) spends his last day on Earth reflecting on his life while walking by a lake near his childhood home where his elderly father still resides. Kelvin is about to embark on an interstellar journey to a space station orbiting the remote oceanic planet Solaris. After decades of study, the scientific mission at the space station has barely progressed. The crew is sending confusing messages. Kelvin is dispatched to evaluate the situation aboard the ship and determine whether the venture should continue. Henri Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky), a former space pilot, visits Kelvin. They watch film footage of Berton's own testimony years before of seeing a four-meter-tall child on the ocean surface of Solaris while searching for two lost scientists. However, the cameras of his craft recorded only clouds and the flat ocean surface; Berton's report was dismissed as hallucinations. After failing to convince Kelvin of the reality of his experience, Berton angrily departs, only to contact Kelvin later via videophone from his private car. He explains that he met the child of a scientist lost on that mission, and the child was like a much smaller version of the one he had seen on Solaris. Before departing Earth for Solaris, Kelvin destroys most of his personal mementos in a bonfire, noting the volume of keepsakes he has accumulated. In Kelvin's last conversation with his father (Nikolai Grinko), they realize that the father will probably not live to see Kelvin return. Although he readily accepted the mission, it is a choice that weighs heavily upon Kelvin's conscience. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station,[10][11] a scientific research station hovering above the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, who finds the disarrayed space station dangerously neglected. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian (Sos Sargsyan), had killed himself. The two surviving crewmen are uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin...

Eg: a living room sofa, etc.  Begin by praying the prayer to our lady of fatima, which is the introductory prayer to the rosary.","output":"1. Explain the importance and purpose of the Rosary to the child: Before starting, it's crucial to make sure the child understands the significance of the Rosary and why we pray it. Explain that the Rosary is a way of meditating on the life of Jesus and Mary and asking for their intercession. This will help the child engage more meaningfully with the prayers. 2. Present the structure of the Rosary: Break down the Rosary into its main parts, including the introductory prayers, the decades, and the concluding prayers. This will help the child follow along and know what to expect as you progress. 3. Teach the child the prayers: If the child is old enough and unfamiliar with the prayers, take time to teach them the basic prayers used throughout the Rosary, such as the Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, and Fatima Prayer. 4. Choose a set of Mysteries: Select one of the four sets of Mysteries to meditate on during the Rosary - the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, or Glorious Mysteries. Share with the child a brief description of each event related to the chosen Mysteries. 5. Begin praying the Rosary together: Start with the Sign of the Cross, followed by the Apostles' Creed, then an Our Father, three Hail Marys, and a Glory Be. After that, announce the first Mystery and begin praying the first decade. 6. Maintain a comfortable pace and involve the child throughout the process: As you continue to pray the Rosary, ensure that the pace is suited for the child and that you make it interactive for them. Encourage the child to participate by leading some prayers, announcing Mysteries, or even reciting prayers from memory. You can also incorporate the use of visuals or storytelling to help the child better understand the events of the Mysteries. 7. Pray the closing prayers: After completing all five decades, say the Hail Holy Queen and any additional concluding prayers. Close with the Sign of the Cross. Afterwards, ask the child about their experience and encourage them to share their thoughts or questions. By engaging the child in this mindful and interactive manner, you will have successfully prayed the Rosary with them, helping them grow in their faith and understanding of this spiritual practice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Before you can spool the line, remove the top part of the reel. Twist is counterclockwise until it’s loose enough to pull off the reel. Some beginner-friendly models have a button you can press to pop off this cap. Unwind any old line left over by spinning the handle. Close-faced and Spincast are different names for the same reel. You’ll know you have one if it has this cover you need to unscrew to reach the reel’s spool. Look for the small rings hanging off the bottom of the rod. Starting at the rod’s tip, run the new line through the holes towards the reel. Pick up the cap and run the line through the hole in the top. If you don’t do this now, you won’t be able to get the cap on later when you need it. Don’t attach the cap to the rest of the reel yet. Like with the other types of rods, the rod’s spool will have a small hollow in the middle where the line rests. Wrap it around this hollow twice so that you’ll have enough to line to tie in place. Always make sure the line goes on the same way the reel rotates. If it rotates clockwise, the line should be wrapped around it counterclockwise. The direction of the rotation depends on the fishing pole. Knot it against the reel so the line doesn’t come undone. You can do this with a slip knot, clinch knot, or arbor knot. Make sure the line is securely tied and tight before you move on. Use your free hand to apply a light amount of pressure on the line as you spool it onto the reel. This will keep the line tense, preventing it from tangling. Hold the line taut between your thumb and index finger, applying a little bit of pressure to keep the line straight. Turn the handle in the same direction you loaded the line, which should have been the same direction the reel normally rotates to unspool the line. For example, if you spooled the line counterclockwise, crank the handle counterclockwise. Load the line, but don’t fill the reel completely. The line should be about 1⁄8 inch (0.32 cm) below the spool's rim. The line should hang from the rest of the rod with no slack. Adding too much can make the line come undone, so you’ll have to spool it all over again. Grab the reel’s cover, which should have already been threaded with the new line. Twist it clockwise onto the reel to secure it in place. If you left the cover off, unwind all of the thread. You’ll need a lot of space for this, so try walking around and hanging the line on fences or other objects so it stays untangled. Then spool the line through the cover and onto the reel. Go back to the tip of the rod. Get a pair of scissors and snip the line beyond the tip’s end. Avoid clipping the line that’s hanging from the line guides under the rod. Summary:","output":"This article is about changing the line on a fishing reel. First, remove the reel's top part by twisting it counterclockwise. Then, take off any old line and put the new line through the holes on the rod, starting from the tip. Put the line through the cap's hole, and wrap it around the spool. Make sure the line goes the same way the reel rotates and tie a knot. Keep the line tight as you spool it and stop when it's about 1/8 inch below the spool's rim.

Can you tell me the answer to how many french soldiers were killed in ww1??","output":"During World War I (1914-1918), France was one of the major countries involved, fighting against the Central Powers, primarily Germany. Due to the significant role France played in the war, the number of French soldiers killed was substantial. Official records state that approximately 1.4 million French soldiers were killed during World War I. However, it is important to note that such statistics may not account for every single soldier, and the precise number could fluctuate. The deaths of French soldiers throughout the war were the result of various factors, including combat, disease, injuries sustained, and other war-related causes. Among these deaths, many young men from France lost their lives, leading to a considerable impact on the country's population. In addition to the French soldiers who lost their lives, around 4.2 million of them were wounded. These figures highlight the immense human cost France bore as a result of the war. The high number of casualties led to a significant shift in the demographics of the country and deeply impacted the lives of the families left behind. World War I, sometimes referred to as the Great War, was one of the deadliest conflicts in history. As a whole, it led to the deaths of around 16 million people, including both military personnel and civilians. The aftermath of the war profoundly altered the global political landscape and significantly changed the way wars were fought, with lessons learned on tactics, strategies, and the need to avoid a similar catastrophic conflict in the future. The heavy death toll and suffering of the French population led to a profound sense of loss and mourning. The war left an indelible mark on the country's collective memory and led to various forms of remembrance, such as memorial days, statues, and monuments to honor the fallen soldiers and their sacrifices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have 0 = -17*o - 840 + 1095. First, let's add 840 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 840 = -17*o - 840 + 840 + 1095. We get 840 = -17*o + 1095. Now, let's subtract 1095 from both sides: 840 - 1095 = -17*o + 1095 - 1095. We get -255 = -17*o. Now, we need to find the value of 'o'. To do this, let's divide both sides by -17: (-255) / (-17) = (-17*o) / (-17). We find that o = 15. So the answer for 'o' is 15! Hurray!

It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it evident to MGM and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars.

Pour some water on the seed and hole: Water the seed and the surrounding soil to moisten it and help the seed settle into its new environment. Ensure not to overwater and flood the hole, as this can hinder proper seed germination. 5. Cover up the hole: Carefully fill the hole back in with soil, being cautious not to overly compact the soil, as this could prevent the seedling from pushing through the surface. 6. Press down on it: Gently press down on the soil to ensure that there is a proper contact between the seed and the soil, which will aid in germination. 7. Spray some plant food on it: Apply an appropriate plant food or fertilizer to the planting area, following the specific product's instructions and recommended application rates. This will provide vital nutrients to support the growth and development of your new plants. Remember that after completing this planting process, it is crucial to keep a consistent watering schedule and monitor the plants for any signs of pests or disease. Proper care and maintenance will ensure your seeds grow into healthy, thriving plants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ian's smile was, while usually a source of comfort to his friends, only stoking the flames of Ryan's anger. His scowl deepened, the furrow between his brows growing more pronounced.  Why was there happiness in Ian's eyes? This puzzled Ryan, gnawing at his heart. With clenched fists, Ryan tried to maintain control of his rage. He could not fathom why Ian could be so merry while he, himself, was soaked in sorrow.  The room filled with tension, as the stark polarity of their moods manifested in their expressions - one grinning from ear to ear, the other scowling as if his world was crumbling. Ian seemed oblivious to Ryan's angst. He filled the room with his bright chatter, his gaiety serving only to  magnify the brooding silence that Ryan wore like a cloak.

Article: The rainbow lorikeet   is a kind of parrot in the northeast of Australia. It is the most colorful and noisy bird in the world. The bird has green, orange, blue, red, yellow, purple and grey colors on its body. Rainbow lorikeets are small birds. They are usually 11 to 12 inches long and weigh 120g to 140g. It is said that they can live for over 20 years in the wild. They usually live in groups. At night, they sleep in the trees in a big group. But during the daytime, they move in much smaller groups (about 20 birds). Late in the evening, you can sometimes see a larger group flying back home. These birds spend a lot of time looking for food. Most of their food comes from trees, like flowers, nuts and fruit. But sometimes they eat insects. They can get water from the leaves that they eat or drink water directly. Rainbow lorikeets usually start to have families when they are around two years old.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - arousal - disease - sweet - halatosis - cooties The answer to this question is:","output":"cooties. Little Sarah's notion that boys have \\"cooties\\" is a common childhood belief that often originates from playground conversations and the idea that boys and girls are fundamentally different. This playful and innocent perception tends to arise during early childhood when children are just beginning to socialize and interact with their peers. At this age, they are also developing their understanding of gender, relationships, and physical affection. The term \\"cooties\\" is a slang word that has been used for generations to describe an imaginary and contagious ailment that is attributed to people — usually, those of the opposite gender — as a means of rationalizing their hesitancy to associate with them. This concept often causes children to play separately from one another, and the idea of cooties is sometimes employed as a teasing taunt. The other options, such as arousal, disease, sweet, and halatosis, are not as fitting in this context because they do not embody the distinctive childlike innocence that the presence of cooties does. Arousal and disease are mature concepts that young children like little Sarah are unlikely to grasp or even think about in their interactions. Sweet is an inapplicable adjective in this context, as it does not explain why Sarah would not want to kiss boys. And while halatosis (bad breath) could be a valid reason, it would generally not be a primary concern for young children who are generally unaware of such specifics. In conclusion, the notion of boys having cooties is a harmless and age-appropriate way for little Sarah to express her reservations about kissing boys — highlighting the childlike innocence and playful distancing that is normal for children as they explore gender roles and relationships at a young age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to Sahih al-Bukhari, the Quran was recited among Levantines and Iraqis, and discussed by Christians and Jews, before it was standardized. Its language was similar to the Syriac language.[citation needed] The Quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in Jewish and Christian sacred books (Tanakh, Bible) and devotional literature (Apocrypha, Midrash), although it differs in many details. Adam, Enoch, Noah, Eber, Shelah, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jethro, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Aaron, Moses, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus are mentioned in the Quran as prophets of God (see Prophets of Islam). In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other individual. Jesus is mentioned more often in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran more than the New Testament. Muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the Bible and other Jewish and Christian writings and Islamic dispensations is due to their common divine source,[citation needed] and that the original Christian or Jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What do devout Muslims believe is the reason for no overlap of events and characters in the Bible and Quran?","output":"Devout Muslims believe that the overlap of events and characters in the Bible and the Quran is due to their common divine source, which is God (Allah). According to Islamic teaching, both the Bible and the Quran are part of a series of divine revelations sent by God to guide humanity. Throughout history, God has sent various prophets to deliver His message, and many of these prophets are mentioned in both the Bible and the Quran. However, it is important to note that while there is significant overlap, there are also differences in the details and interpretations of these events and characters between the two scriptures. Muslims believe that these differences are mainly due to the corruption and alteration of earlier revealed scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible. They hold that over time, these texts have been changed by humans, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. In this context, the Quran is viewed as the final, perfect, and unaltered revelation from God, carrying the ultimate truth and correcting the inaccuracies found in previous scriptures. The Quran addresses many of the same events and characters as the Bible, but often provides different perspectives or additional information to clarify misconceptions or skewed interpretations that might have arisen because of human interference with earlier texts. Thus, devout Muslims believe that the overlap of events and characters in the Bible and the Quran is a testament to their common divine origin, while the differences are a result of human alterations to the original revelations. The Quran is seen as the ultimate source of truth that resolves any discrepancies and provides a more accurate account of both their shared and unique events and characters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Available options: I. No. II. Yes. A:","output":"I. No. A more appropriate and detailed answer to the question \\"Who makes BlackBerry?\\" would be as follows: BlackBerry is a brand of smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices. It was originally developed and manufactured by the Canadian company, Research In Motion (RIM). RIM was founded in 1984 by Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin, and its headquarters are located in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Over the years, RIM became internationally recognized for its BlackBerry line of products, which gained significant popularity, particularly in the business and corporate sectors due to their secure email and messaging services, as well as strong data security features. The first BlackBerry device, an email pager, was introduced in 1999. However, it was the release of the first BlackBerry smartphone in 2003 with a built-in phone, email, and web browser that changed the mobile landscape. In 2013, the company underwent a rebranding, changing its name from Research In Motion Limited (RIM) to BlackBerry Limited to emphasize its focus on the BlackBerry brand. In 2016, BlackBerry shifted away from in-house hardware development and began relying on partners to manufacture and distribute its devices. As part of this transition, BlackBerry signed licensing agreements with several hardware manufacturers, including TCL Communication, Optiemus Infracom, and BB Merah Putih. The statement \\"In 2011, the Caribbean and Latin America had the highest penetrations of BlackBerry smartphones worldwide, with up to about 45 per cent in the region having a RIM device\\" provides valuable historical context about the company's market presence, but it does not accurately answer the question of who makes BlackBerry devices.

Q:Process: - Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up - The rocks slowly break down.  Question: suppose Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The process you've mentioned pertains to physical weathering, specifically freeze-thaw weathering and thermal expansion and contraction, the general weathering actions that the natural environment imposes on rocks. The task - \\"Load dishes directly into dishwasher after use\\" - is a household action that likely wouldn't have any direct effect on the rate or intensity of physical weathering happening on rocks. Let's break it down. 1. Water Seeping into Rocks: This is an entirely natural process contingent upon precipitation, humidity, and rock permeability. Loading dishes into a dishwasher doesn't create more rainfall or increase the water in an outdoor setting in a way that can increase water's capabilities to infiltrate into rocks. 2. The Water Freezes and Thaws: This is dependent on temperature cycles and not on human domestic actions such as cleaning dishes. Unless an individual is somehow manipulating outdoor temperatures in the rock's immediate environment, this process is largely beyond human control. 3. Cracks Form in the Rocks: Again, this is a result of natural physical weathering processes which are not affected by loading dishes into a dishwasher. 4. Cracks Also Form When Rocks Heat Up: Thermal expansion happens due to natural daily temperature fluctuations and is not impacted by household tasks. 5. The Rocks Slowly Break Down: The breakdown of rocks is a long-term geological process. Loading dishes into a dishwasher does not accelerate or decelerate this. To sum it all up, the action of loading dishes directly into a dishwasher after use has no effect on weathering occurring more or faster. The processes of weathering are natural geological occurrences that are impacted by environmental conditions such as climatic changes, temperature fluctuations, and natural erosional agents. They are not influenced by human domestic activities such as dishwashing. So, the supposed perturbation does not influence the second effect mentioned, that is, the freeze and thaw action of water in rocks. The two actions exist in completely separate domains – one being an indoor, domestic activity and the other being an external, geological event. Monitoring and manipulating the factors that actually affect weathering – like climate, type of rock, and surrounding vegetation, can make a genuine difference in its progress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Given the following context:  Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, \\"I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday\\". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, \\"Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?\\"In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as \\"a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony\\". As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.  answer the following question:  What was the name of the person that conducted the Tchaikovsky symphony?

Q:I read this background article the other day: In the study of thermochemical processes, things are viewed from the point of view of the system. A chemical reaction or physical change is endothermic if heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings. In the course of an endothermic process, the system gains heat from the surroundings and so the temperature of the surroundings decreases. The quantity of heat for a process is represented by the letter . The sign of for an endothermic process is positive because the system is gaining heat. A chemical reaction or physical change is exothermic if heat is released by the system into the surroundings. Because the surroundings is gaining heat from the system, the temperature of the surroundings increases. The sign of for an exothermic process is negative because the system is losing heat.  I am facing a new situation today: Calving is sitting in his kitchen when he decides to play around with some ice and water. He takes an ice cube out of the freezer and puts it on a plate on his kitchen table. He then takes a glass of water and puts it into the freezer. He is curious to see if the ice cube will melt before the water freezes.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Is the water freezing an exothermic or endothermic reaction? A:","output":"The water freezing is an exothermic reaction. This is because as water freezes and turns into ice, it releases heat into its surroundings. In an exothermic process, the system (in this case, water) loses heat, which results in a negative value for the heat quantity (q).

He was the author of a chronicle or historical synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the reign of Nikephoros Botaneiates ( 1081 ) , sponsored by Irene Komnene , the emperor 's sister - in - law . It consists of about 7000 lines in the so - called political verse . It obtained great popularity and appeared in a free prose translation ; it was also translated into Bulgarian and Roman Slavic in the 14th century and enjoyed a great popularity .

In 1969 Bulgaria issued two sets of stamps depicting important scenes of the chronicle , to celebrate it . Manasses also wrote the poetical romance Loves of Aristander and Callithea , also in political verse , is only known from the fragments preserved in the rose - garden of Macanus Chrysocephalus ( 14th century ) . Manasses also wrote a short biography of Oppian , and some descriptive pieces ( all except one unpublished ) on artistic and other subjects .  - The Komnenian Restoration is the term used by historians to describe the military, financial, and territorial recovery of the Byzantine Empire under the Komnenian dynasty, from the accession of Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 to the death of Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. At the onset of the reign of Alexios I, the empire was reeling from its defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The empire was also being threatened by the Normans of Robert Guiscard, who were invading the Balkans from their base in southern Italy. All this occurred as the empire's military institution was in disarray and had grown increasingly reliant on mercenaries. Previous emperors had also squandered the large gold deposits of Constantinople, so the defense of the empire had broken down, and there were few troops to fill the gaps.  - Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus \\"Manoul I Komnnos\\"; 28 November 1118  24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean.

The characters in Aaron's novel were more unique than Kyle's because","output":"the intricacies and complex backgrounds of each individual were carefully woven into their personalities, bringing forth connections and conflicts that made the story more engaging and emotionally resonant. In Aaron's novel, every character had a distinct voice, a result of the author's meticulous crafting of their personal histories, desires, fears, and aspirations. These characters were not merely archetypes or stereotypes, but rather multi-dimensional beings that came to life in the readers' minds as they embarked on their respective journeys throughout the narrative. The author managed to capture the essence of human emotion and experience in his characters, making it easier for readers to relate to and empathize with them. For example, the protagonist of Aaron's novel, Emma, was a fiercely independent and headstrong young woman who gradually uncovered a hidden vulnerability as her personal struggles and challenges were brought to light. This rich exploration into Emma's character not only made her journey throughout the story more engaging, but it fostered a sense of attachment for the reader, who became genuinely invested in her emotional growth and well-being. On the other hand, the secondary characters in Aaron's novel were just as thoughtfully developed, each with their unique backstories and motivations that contributed to the overall fabric of the plot. The characters' interactions and relationships with one another were complex, sometimes filled with tension and rivalry, creating a dynamic, believable universe that drew the reader deeper into the story. In contrast, Kyle's novel, while entertaining and well-written, did not achieve the same level of intricate character development. The characters in his story tended to fall into recognizable tropes or categories, making them appear somewhat two-dimensional and predictable. This limited the reader's ability to deeply relate to the characters, ultimately detracting from the overall impact of the story. Furthermore, the relationships and interactions between the characters in Kyle's novel were less nuanced, often boiling down to superficial bonds or straightforward conflicts that resolved quickly. While every story requires some level of conflict, the lack of layered connections and complexities between characters in Kyle's novel made the events feel more contrived and less engaging. Ultimately, it was the well-crafted, multifaceted characters in Aaron's novel that set it apart from Kyle's. The attention to detail and dedication to exploring the complexities of human emotion and experience made the characters in Aaron's novel feel more authentic and relatable, capturing the reader's imagination and eliciting a genuine investment in their well-being and personal journeys. By developing characters that resonated on such an intimate level, Aaron succeeded in crafting a unique, memorable narrative that surpassed the boundaries of convention and left a lasting impression on all who read it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Six years later, the film introduces Liz Reynolds, a young woman whose psychic bond to Mike and the Tall Man manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him. Mike, who has been institutionalized after the events of the first film, fakes his recovery to make contact with Liz. When Mike returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume the bodies of his parents, Reggie interrupts him and explains that the earlier attack never took place. However, Mike reveals the coffins are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt down the Tall Man. En route to Reggie's house, Mike has a premonition and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before an explosion kills Reggie's entire family. Convinced by Mike's futile warning, Reggie agrees to accompany Mike. They break into a hardware store and stock up on supplies and weapons. Traveling country roads, they encounter abandoned towns, pillaged graveyards, and a few of the Tall Man's traps; one is an apparition of a nude, deceased young woman. The clues lead them to PÃ©rigord, Oregon. Meanwhile, Liz's grandfather dies, and her sister Jeri disappears during the funeral; while searching for Jeri, Liz finds the Tall Man and flees.

Czech:","output":"Proč se sakra nevdáš za to dřevěného koně a nezajezdíš si ho do pekla!! Step by step translation: 1. \\"Why don't you\\" - This is a question asking for a reason, so I translated it to \\"Proč ne\\" in Czech. By adding \\"se\\" (reflexive pronoun), we can emphasize the action towards the person, making it \\"proč se ne...?\\" 2. \\"marry\\" - The verb 'to marry' in Czech is \\"vdát se\\" for women and \\"oženit se\\" for men. In this case, since there is no specific gender given, I used the neutral option \\"vdát se\\" which typically refers to a woman, but can sometimes be used more generally. 3. \\"the friggin'\\" - This colloquial slang intensifies the noun following it. Its Czech equivalent is \\"sakra\\" which is a mild curse word, similar to \\"damn\\" or \\"bloody\\" in English. I translated this as \\"za to sakra\\" in order to retain the emphasis on the noun. 4. \\"wooden horse\\" - The noun phrase 'wooden horse' can be translated directly into Czech as \\"dřevěný kůň\\". 5. \\"and\\" - The conjunction 'and' translates to \\"a\\" in Czech. 6. \\"ride it\\" - In Czech, this can be translated as \\"zajezdit si ho\\", which implies that both the action of riding and the object 'it' (the horse) are included. 7. \\"to hell\\" - The expression 'to hell' is commonly used in English to convey a strong negative reaction to something.

Group A used brewer's yeast on flower and tried to make bread. and Group B brewed beer with brewer's yeast, then baked bread with baker's yeast.  and a hint : Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.  Please answer this question : Which group caused the bread to rise more? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be deduced that Group B caused the bread to rise more. To better understand why, let's first analyze the methods used by the two groups: Group A: They used brewer's yeast on a flower and attempted to make bread. Brewer's yeast, as mentioned, is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the same species as baker's yeast but a different strain. The primary purpose of brewer's yeast is for the fermentation of alcohol in beer production. Though it can contribute to some leavening, it is not specifically optimized for breadmaking. Group B: They brewed beer with brewer's yeast (a normal process), but when they baked bread, they used baker's yeast. Baker's yeast, also Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a strain specifically intended for breadmaking. It is a leavening agent that causes bread to rise by converting fermentable sugars in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast has been selectively bred and cultivated to optimize its bread-rising capabilities. Consequently, it provides superior leavening properties compared to brewer's yeast when used in breadmaking. Even though both strains belong to the same species, the difference in their selection and optimization makes baker's yeast more effective in causing the bread to rise. In conclusion, as Group B used the correct strain of yeast (baker's yeast) for breadmaking, their bread would have risen more compared to Group A's bread, which was made using brewer's yeast, a strain not specifically optimized for breadmaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000.

Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media.

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - The Kaweka Range ( also known as the Kaweka Ranges ) of mountains is located in inland Hawke 's Bay in the eastern North Island of New Zealand . It forms part of the mountainous spine of the North Island which runs from Wellington to East Cape , including the Tararua and Ruahine ranges . The range lies between the city of Napier , 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) to the southeast , and Lake Taupo , 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) to the northwest . It is the source of many rivers which flow into Hawke Bay , including among them the Tutaekuri , Mohaka , and Ngaruroro Rivers . The highest point in the range is Kaweka J ( 1,724 metres ( 5,656 ft ) ) . The bush line varies from 1000 m to 1300 m. A tramping track follows the ridge line of the entire range . The Kaweka challenge is a running race held annually in the range since 1990 .  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France.

Who directed the films The Graduate, Silkwood and Primary Colours?","output":"The acclaimed director responsible for directing the films The Graduate, Silkwood, and Primary Colors is none other than Mike Nichols. Born on November 6, 1931, in Berlin, Germany, and named Mikhail Igor Peschkowsky, he later moved to the United States to escape Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II and eventually became one of the most influential filmmakers in cinematic history. Mike Nichols began his career as a theatrical performer and eventually transitioned into directing for both stage and screen. His ability to understand and communicate complex human emotions and situations, combined with his keen sense of comedy and drama, contributed to his directorial triumphs in film and theater. The Graduate, released in 1967, is arguably one of Nichols' most celebrated works. The film, starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, is a coming-of-age story about a young man, Benjamin Braddock, who finds himself entangled in a love triangle with an older woman, Mrs. Robinson, and her daughter, Elaine. The Graduate received critical acclaim for its poignant take on disillusionment, love, and confusion that was quite common among the younger generation in the late '60s. Mike Nichols won the Academy Award for Best Director for The Graduate, which was also nominated for six other Oscars. Silkwood, released in 1983, was a biographical drama film that featured Meryl Streep, Kurt Russell, and Cher in the lead roles. The movie is based on the real-life story of Karen Silkwood, a labor union activist who worked at a plutonium-processing plant and died under mysterious circumstances after becoming a whistleblower on dangerous practices and safety violations at the facility. Silkwood was a critical success and received multiple Academy Award nominations, including one for Meryl Streep, who gave a powerful performance in the lead role. The film cemented Nichols' reputation as a master of deeply human stories with a social and political resonance. Primary Colors, released in 1998, is a satirical comedy-drama that delves into the world of electoral campaigns and the dark underbelly of American politics. The film, which is based on a bestselling novel written by Joe Klein, stars John Travolta, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton among others. It tells the story of a Southern governor, Jack Stanton, whose run for presidency unfolds amid various scandals and betrayals. Primary Colors was appreciated for its blend of humor, engaging storyline, and evocative portrayal of the triumphs and tribulations of working in high-stakes political environments. In summary, Mike Nichols directed the films The Graduate, Silkwood, and Primary Colors. His films often dealt with complex human experiences and relationships, and his directorial prowess earned him recognition and accolades from audiences and critics alike. Nichols passed away on November 19, 2014, leaving behind a rich legacy of work that continues to inspire filmmakers today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices:  - protons  - electrons  - nuclei  - neutrons  A: The answer is:","output":"- neutrons Different isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons. To fully understand why, one must understand the basic structure of an atom, and what isotopes are. An atom, the smallest unit of an element, consists of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons occupy the center of the atom, known as the nucleus, while electrons circle around the nucleus in something called electron shells.  The atomic number of an element corresponds to the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. This number is key in defining the element; for example, carbon atoms always have 6 protons, oxygen atoms have 8 protons, and so on. The contribution of protons to the atomic mass is significant due to their relative mass.  Electrons, while crucial for chemical reactions and electrical charge, have a much smaller mass compared to protons and neutrons. Thus, their contribution to the overall atomic mass is often negligible.    Neutrons, like protons, are located in the nucleus of the atom and are about the same mass as a proton. Neutrons are unique because the number of neutrons can vary among atoms of the same element.  Which brings us to isotopes. Isotopes are versions of an element that share the same atomic number (the same number of protons) but have different numbers of neutrons. This variation in neutron number results in isotopes having different atomic masses, as the mass number (also known as atomic mass) of an isotope is calculated by adding the number of protons and neutrons together. For example, the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and is called carbon-12. However, there exists an isotope of carbon, known as carbon-14, which has 6 protons (like all carbon atoms) but 8 neutrons.  In summary, all atoms of a given element will have the same number of protons, and generally the same number of electrons, but can have different numbers of neutrons. These different versions, or isotopes, of the same element have different mass numbers due to the variation in the number of neutrons. Thus, isotopes of an element have different mass numbers because they have different numbers of neutrons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The phrase translates to \\"Middle-distance running\\" in English. Middle-distance running typically refers to track events that range from 800 meters to 5000 meters in length, including popular races such as the 800 meters, 1500 meters, and the 3000-meter steeplechase. These events require a combination of speed, strength, and endurance. Middle-distance races can be quite challenging, as they necessitate athletes to not only have a considerable level of aerobic fitness but also possess the ability to maintain a fast pace throughout the race. Training for middle-distance running typically involves a mix of aerobic and anaerobic workouts, focusing on building both endurance and speed. Some key elements of middle-distance running training include: 1. Aerobic endurance: This is the foundation of any middle-distance training program. Athletes need to develop their cardiovascular fitness through various exercises such as steady runs, long runs, and interval training. 2. Anaerobic capacity: Middle-distance runners need to improve their ability to tolerate and clear lactic acid produced during high-intensity exercise. This can be achieved through high-intensity interval training, tempo runs, and hill sprints. 3. Running economy: Improving running economy means enhancing the efficiency of the body's energy use while running. Activities such as strength training, plyometrics, and drills focused on proper running technique can help improve running economy. 4. Speed development: Middle-distance runners should incorporate speed work into their training to increase their aerobic and anaerobic power. This may involve short sprints, strides, or other speed-focused exercises. 5. Race-specific preparation: Training for a particular race distance should involve specific workouts tailored to the event's demands. For example, an 800-meter runner might focus on 400-meter repeats at their intended race pace, while a 1500-meter runner might target longer intervals with shorter recovery periods. In addition to these physical components, middle-distance runners must also develop mental toughness and race strategy. A strong mental approach can help athletes maintain focus and composure during competitions, while efficient race strategies can enable runners to navigate the pack more effectively and conserve energy for the latter stages of the race. Ultimately, success in middle-distance running requires a balance of physical preparation, mental fortitude, and tactical savvy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: What may be a plausible reason I was staggering on the way to Tina ’s ?","output":"A plausible reason for you staggering on the way to Tina's could be a combination of factors, including lack of sleep, inadequate nutrition, and dehydration. You mentioned that you went to bed late and had to get up early, which might not have provided enough rest to properly rejuvenate your body and mind. This lack of sleep may have caused fatigue, which could have led to impaired balance and coordination, making it difficult to walk steadily. Additionally, not being able to eat any breakfast and opting for a few Pepsis as your main source of sustenance might have contributed to the staggering. Consuming a high-sugar beverage like Pepsi on an empty stomach can cause a rapid spike in blood sugar, followed by a sudden drop. This fluctuation in blood sugar levels can lead to dizziness, weakness, and sometimes even impaired coordination. Moreover, consuming only soda (which might be the case since you skipped breakfast) can lead to dehydration, as sodas can be diuretics, which means they can increase the production of urine and cause more fluid loss in the body. Dehydration can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and impaired balance, all of which could contribute to the staggering observed. In conclusion, the staggering on the way to Tina's could likely be attributed to a combination of inadequate sleep, poor nutrition, and possible dehydration. These factors can collectively impair your balance and coordination, making it difficult for you to walk steadily and necessitating the need to pull yourself together to appear normal and coherent upon arrival.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What kingdom converted to Christianity before Alodia?, using the article: John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century.

The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas. (St. Mary's later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more.  Question: \\"Consdider the original schools in the consortium and those that have joined to find out how many are currently teaching this type of law.\\" Answer: \\"Madison University\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

A prayer to god Isis said: \\"Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red.\\" The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the rubia, or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as alizarin, and also used it to color white power to use as a pigment, which became known as madder lake, alizarin or alizarin crimson.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The portion of the Madder Plant used by Ancient Egyptians in the production of a red dye was the root. They utilized the root of the Rubia, or Madder plant, to create a dye that later became known as Alizarin. Additionally, they used this dye to color white powder, which they then utilized as a pigment. This pigment was referred to as Madder Lake, Alizarin, or Alizarin Crimson. By extracting color from the Madder plant's root, the Ancient Egyptians were able to produce a vibrant red dye that held significant cultural and artistic value. Despite the color red sometimes being associated with negative connotations such as heat, destruction, and evil, it was still prominently used in various art forms, like wall paintings, particularly for depicting the skin color of men.

The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused  ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people.

The place of worship in Nome, North Dakota, was recently purchased by Craig Cobb, who tried to set up a whites-only enclave in another part of the state. The blaze was reported on Wednesday afternoon and the structure was razed by the time fire crews arrived after nearly an hour. Cobb said the fire at the former Zion Lutheran church was \\"100% arson\\". He told WDAY-TV, a Fargo-based news station, that he is offering a reward of 2,000 (Â£1,600) to anyone with any information related to the incident, which he said was a direct attack on his life. Local residents said that it appeared Cobb had not yet moved in the 108-year-old building. He says the gas and electric utilities had not been hooked up, so the fire could not have been accidental. The blaze occurred on the same day that news of the sale appeared on the front page of the Fargo Forum newspaper. The North Dakota State Fire Marshal's Office is helping with the investigation. Cobb told WDAY-TV that he is considering several options about what to do next. He says he might open a new church called \\"the President Donald J Trump Church of Rome\\", not Nome, the town located about 70 miles (112km) southwest of Fargo. Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. In 2011, he began buying run-down properties in the tiny town of Leith, just southwest of Bismarck, North Dakota, with the plan of turning it into an Aryan stronghold.

Answer the following question: Question: what causes thunder sound I found the following answer on Google: In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a sonic boom , which produces the sound of thunder, often referred to as a clap, crack, or peal of thunder. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct. The sound of thunder is caused by the sudden and rapid expansion of air due to the intense heat produced by lightning. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's break down the process involved in the formation of thunder. 1. Formation of lightning: Thunder is a byproduct of lightning, and hence, the formation of thunder is directly related to the process of lightning. Lightning is a massive electrostatic discharge that occurs within a thunderstorm. When there is a significant difference in electrical charges between the ground and the cloud, a lightning flash takes place. This electrical discharge superheats the surrounding air to temperatures around 30,000 Kelvin, or about five times hotter than the surface of the Sun. 2. Rapid expansion of air: Since the air surrounding the lightning bolt is heated to extreme temperatures, it causes the air to expand rapidly. The expansion occurs at a supersonic speed, creating a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. This shock wave compresses the surrounding air, causing it to vibrate and generate a loud, explosive noise. 3. Sound waves travel through the air: The shock wave, which is also a sound wave, travels through the atmosphere at the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies depending on factors such as temperature, humidity, and altitude; however, it typically travels at about 1,117 feet (340 meters) per second at sea level and 20°C. As the sound wave travels through the air, it disperses - causing the intensity of the sound to decrease over a distance. 4. Perception of thunder: When the sound wave reaches our ears, we perceive it as the cracking, rumbling, booming noise that we commonly associate with thunder. The different sounds of thunder are a result of numerous factors, including the distance, intensity, and position of the lightning, and the nature of the surrounding environment (e.g., terrain, temperature, humidity, etc.). To summarize, the sound of thunder is caused by the rapid expansion of air due to the intense heat produced by lightning. This expansion generates a sonic shock wave that travels through the atmosphere, creating the familiar sound we associate with thunderstorms. The answer you found on Google accurately describes this phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Additionally, the description of the vehicle does not provide any information on whether it is military-related or simply an ordinary civilian vehicle. Because we have insufficient information, we cannot definitively conclude whether the hypothesis (the man is a soldier) is true or false. We would need more specific context and details to determine whether or not the man is a soldier, such as information about the situation he is in, the type of vehicle, and any other distinctive features that would indicate his possible profession or affiliation.

Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student didn't learn that the infected skin area may become painful?  Hint: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. The answer is:","output":"Neither Dan nor Bob are explicitly mentioned in the provided paragraph as not learning about the infected skin area becoming painful. Both students learned about the human immune system, but the paragraph does not provide specific information about their knowledge of inflammation and its effects.

William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties  did not protect them and many were killed.

Accelerate smoothly and gently when leaving intersections and stop signs. It is inconsiderate of other drivers and even contributes to congestion at intersections, to dawdle once the light turns green.","output":"1. Maintain a Consistent Speed: Driving at a consistent speed can significantly improve your gas mileage. This is because rapid acceleration and deceleration both use more fuel. Instead, maintaining a steady speed is considered to be more fuel-efficient.  2. Limit the Use of Air Conditioner: Air conditioners can significantly increase fuel consumption. When possible, use the vehicle's vent system instead. You’ll save more fuel by not using your air conditioner, especially at highway speeds. 3. Remove Extra Weight: Unnecessary weight in your car makes the engine work harder and consume more fuel. By removing heavy items in your vehicle, you can easily improve your fuel efficiency. 4. Regularly Service Your Vehicle: Regular maintenance of your vehicle, like oil changes and replacing air filters, can go a long way towards improving gas mileage. A well-maintained vehicle runs more efficiently, reducing fuel consumption. 5. Use Cruise Control: Cruise control can help you maintain a constant speed and save gas, especially for long trips on the highways. But it's not great for city driving with many stops and starts. 6. Keep Your Tires Properly Inflated: Underinflated tires have more rolling resistance, which means your engine has to work harder to move your vehicle, using more fuel. You should regularly check your tire pressure to ensure it's at the recommended level. 7. Limit Idling: Idling, or keeping your engine running when standing still, can waste a significant amount of fuel. Try to avoid keeping your car running when you're not moving for more extended periods. These strategies are proven ways to improve your fuel efficiency, save money on fuel expenses, and reduce your impact on the environment.

Question: What type of car does Edward's sister drive? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Vampires Suck Context: Becca Crane (Jenn Proske) moves to Sporks to live with her clueless father, Sheriff Frank (Diedrich Bader), after her mother starts an affair with Tiger Woods. Meanwhile, a killing spree targeting random locals is attributed to the Canadians, but the real perpetrators are a group of vampires, who are commonly confused with the Black Eyed Peas. Becca quickly befriends many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol). She is also intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna. Later, when Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot, Edward stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in the van's way. He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old. Imagine you have a toy collection. We will use \\"b\\" to represent how many toys you have. Now, you have 368 toy bins, and each bin has \\"b\\" toys. So, 368 * b is the total number of toys in all the bins. Now, your friend gives you 712 more toys! Yay! Your total number of toys is 279 * b (toys in the 279 bins) plus those 712 new toys. So, the entire toy collection now is equal. We can say 368 * b (the toys in 368 bins) equals 279 * b (toys in the 279 bins) plus 712 new toys. Now let's solve it: 1. From 368 * b, we'll take away 279 * b. We're left with (368 - 279) * b = 712. 2. That means 89 * b = 712. Now, we need to figure out how many toys are in each bin (find the value of \\"b\\"). 3. To find it, we'll divide 712 by 89: 712 / 89 = 8. So, there are 8 toys in each bin (b = 8)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The non-conductive region is called the dielectric. In simpler terms, the dielectric is just an electrical insulator. Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, vacuum, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors. A capacitor is assumed to be self-contained and isolated, with no net electric charge and no influence from any external electric field. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field. In SI units, a capacitance of one farad means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device. What type of charges do conductors hold on their facing surfaces?","output":"Imagine a capacitor is like two pieces of bread with something non-conductive like plastic in between.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the defined process, the production of ice cubes is based on a sequential series of steps: taking a tray, adding water into it, placing the tray into a freezer, allowing the water molecules to slow down through decreased temperature, facilitating the transformation of water into ice, and the final step - the creation of ice cubes. If there's no need for ice cubes, the overall process won't necessarily change unless the purpose behind the stages alters. In this case, the altered purpose doesn't directly impact the individual steps of the process. For instance, the tasks of filling a tray with water and placing it into a freezer would still continue as before. The water would still turn into ice due to reduced temperature. There is no direct interference or modification with the individual steps involved in the transition process from water to ice. However, the lack of need for ice cubes could indirectly impact the final step of the process, mainly the production of ice cubes itself. If ice cubes are not required, you, as a person, might choose to not initiate the process in the first place, or disrupted the process after the freezing has begun by taking the tray out before it's fully solidified into ice cubes, which leads to less ice cubes being made.  So the supposed perturbation in this context is driven not by direct alteration of the process, but by an indirect influence based on changed circumstances, i.e., the reduced (or null) demand for ice cubes. The entire process is still the same fundamentally; it’s just that the endpoint (making ice cubes) might no longer be reached due to the changed circumstances. In conclusion, when the need for ice cubes is eliminated, it would indirectly impact a step of the process by altering the outcome of the process (the production of lesser ice cubes or maybe none at all), but the individual steps of the process remain unaltered and still function the way they're supposed to."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Orphaned as a child, Dubois looks after a large group of young orphans by performing cons and stealing. After stealing a large sum of money from a group of gangsters, Dubois and the children are found by the gangsters. Dubois is able to subdue the gangsters, but the struggle draws the attention of the police. After promising to return to the children, Dubois escapes the police by stowing away on a boat. He is found out by the crew and imprisoned by gun smugglers and pirates and forced into physical labor.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  BookWars is a creative documentary which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling. Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken.  answer the following question:  What three words describe Ron?

It can be inferred that these plans have an objective or goal to achieve, and the teams have been created to facilitate the completion of these tasks or projects. Based on the context provided, Carson's next logical course of action would be to separate everyone into teams to work. This decision aligns with the recently completed steps, ensuring that the teams can move forward with their respective tasks effectively. Breaking people into teams is usually done to enhance collaboration, problem-solving capability, and communication among members who have specific skills that complement each other towards the desired outcome. Therefore, Carson would want to make sure the teams are well-organized, understand their roles and responsibilities, and are prepared to tackle the tasks assigned.

Pat, a hotel switchboard operator and Peter a crane operator are a happy well meaning couple, however because of their different shifts during the day they have no time for each other. While he works during the day on the construction of Waterloo Bridge his patient wife works during the night on a hotel telephone exchange. One morning on his way to work, Peter goes on the London Underground train and spots what seems to be a murder being committed on at the open window of a building overlooking the tracks. Deciding to investigate this \\"crime\\" Peter and a policeman arrive at the residence. There they find out that the couple were in fact rehearsing an illusion. Zoltini is a bad tempered magician and his wife Vivienne is his assistant. The suspicious magician becomes sure that his wife is having an affair with Peter - every time he sees her with the handsome stranger. On another night Zoltini and Vivienne have an argument on the backstage - leading to him slapping her in the face. As a result, Vivienne leaves (while her husband performs on stage) and takes a taxi with Peter up to his crane. Furious with Vivienne for leaving during the 'vanishing women' sequence of their performance, Zoltini looks for his wife while Pat has been sacked from the hotel for not paying attention to her job. A:","output":"In the given article, the magician's assistant, Vivienne, leaves while her husband Zoltini is performing on stage. This happens as a result of an argument they have backstage, which leads to Zoltini slapping her in the face. Unable to tolerate this behavior, Vivienne leaves the performance in the middle of their 'vanishing women' sequence, and takes a taxi with Peter, a crane operator who has been mistaken as her lover by her husband, up to his crane. The situation arose from the happenstance meeting between Peter and the magician couple. Peter, on his way to work, witnesses what appears to be a murder being committed through an open window of a building overlooking the train tracks. Concerned, he and a police officer go to the residence to investigate the situation, only to discover that it was actually Zoltini and Vivienne rehearsing an illusion for their act. Despite this, Zoltini becomes increasingly suspicious that his wife is having an affair with Peter, as he repeatedly sees her with him. In reality, Peter and Vivienne's interactions are innocent, but Zoltini's insecurity and jealousy lead to conflict and ultimately, her departure from the performance. In addition, Pat, Peter's wife, is facing her own issues at work as a hotel switchboard operator. Due to the unfortunate timing of her husband's encounters with Vivienne coupled with their differing work schedules, Pat has been distracted from her duties and is eventually fired from her job. Thus, in the midst of the chaos and misunderstandings arising from the intersecting lives of these four characters, it is Vivienne, the magician's assistant, who leaves the performance while her husband is still on stage. This act symbolizes her decision to stand up for herself and break free from the abusive and controlling relationship she shares with her jealous husband, Zoltini."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When did the city attain military importance Context: A few centuries later, coinciding with the first waves of the invading Germanic peoples (Suevi, Vandals and Alans, and later the Visigoths) and the power vacuum left by the demise of the Roman imperial administration, the church assumed the reins of power in the city and replaced the old Roman temples with religious buildings. With the Byzantine invasion of the southwestern Iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance. After the expulsion of the Byzantines in 625, Visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient Roman amphitheatre was fortified. Little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology, excavations suggest that there was little development of the city. During Visigothic times Valencia was an episcopal See of the Catholic Church, albeit a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archdiocese of Toledo, comprising the ancient Roman province of Carthaginensis in Hispania.

Given the two facts above, sense of smell impacts an animal's what? Choose your answer from: A). mate; B). reproduction; C). growth; D). habitat; E). survival; F). Movement; G). hormones; H). traits; Answer:","output":"E). survival Given the two facts stated, we can conclude that a better sense of smell impacts an animal's survival. Fact 1 mentions that better senses have a positive impact on an animal's survival, while Fact 2 emphasizes that our sense of smell is infinitely better. Considering these two pieces of information, it can be deduced that an improved sense of smell plays a vital role in an animal's survival. A better sense of smell provides numerous benefits to animals. First and foremost, it allows them to detect food sources more effectively. For example, animals with an enhanced sense of smell can locate food from greater distances or track down prey that may not be easily detectable through other senses. Additionally, an improved sense of smell helps animals avoid predators and other potential threats. By detecting the scent of a predator, an animal can take the necessary precautions to evade danger, such as hiding or fleeing the area. This early warning system can ultimately save an animal's life and improve its chances of survival in the wild. Social interactions are another critical aspect of animal behavior that can be influenced by a heightened sense of smell. Many animals rely on scent to communicate with one another, whether it's to establish social hierarchies, find a mate, or mark territories. A powerful sense of smell can significantly affect an animal's ability to interact with its peers, which, in turn, can have a profound impact on reproduction and overall population health. Lastly, an enhanced sense of smell can also aid animals in navigating their environments more efficiently. Migratory animals often require a strong sense of smell to detect and follow scent trails left by their kind, helping them navigate extensive distances in search of food, shelter, or mating grounds. In a constantly changing environment, the ability to adapt and navigate is crucial to an animal's survival. In conclusion, given the facts presented and the numerous benefits associated with an improved sense of smell, it is clear that sense of smell significantly impacts an animal's survival."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - basement - universe - amazonia - forest - tropical jungle  The answer is \\"tropical jungle\\" because","output":"sloths are primarily found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. The tropical jungle provides an ideal habitat for sloths due to its dense vegetation, high humidity, and constant warm temperatures.  In these tropical jungles, sloths can be found living in the mid-to-upper canopy levels of the forest, where they have access to their primary food source—leaves from the cecropia tree, as well as fruits and flowers. The abundant plant life in the tropical jungle offers a constant supply of food, which is essential for the slow-moving and low-energy lifestyle of the sloth. The tropical jungle's complex ecosystem also provides protection for sloths from predators, such as eagles and jaguars. Sloths have intricate camouflage that helps them blend in with their surroundings, making it more difficult for predators to spot them. They also have long, curved claws that allow them to securely hang from branches while they rest or sleep, reducing the risk of falling. Furthermore, the high humidity and warm temperatures of the tropical jungle create a humid and stable microclimate that allows various algae and fungi to grow on the sloths' fur. This algae contributes to the sloths' camouflage, helps regulate their body temperature, and provides nutrients when sloths groom themselves. In summary, the tropical jungle is the perfect habitat for sloths as it offers abundant food, shelter, protection from predators, and a suitable climate that sustains their unique lifestyle and characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Rarity in plants and animals frequently manifests itself in small or reduced population size.  Given the two facts above, if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases? A:","output":"Given the two facts mentioned above, it can be concluded that if a species is rare, harm to its population would result in an increase in the negative impact on the species' overall population size and further contribute to their rarity.  To explain this in detail, let's first consider Fact 1: Harming an animal species has a negative impact on the population size of that species. This fact suggests that any damage, injury, or disturbance to a species, whether it is through habitat loss, hunting, or other environmental stressors, would lead to a decrease in the number of individuals within that species. This impact may affect the species' ability to reproduce, find food, or establish suitable living conditions. The reduction in population size can make the species more vulnerable to external pressures and potentially push it closer to extinction. Now let's consider Fact 2: Rarity in plants and animals frequently manifests itself in small or reduced population size. This means that when a species is rare, it typically has fewer individuals within its population compared to a more abundant species. A smaller population size obviously increases the vulnerability of a species, as there is a smaller genetic pool and fewer individuals to protect against potential threats. The rarity of a species can be attributed to several factors, including habitat loss, limited resources, overexploitation, competition, or other factors that reduce its ability to grow and maintain a healthy population. Combining these two facts, it becomes clear that if a species is rare, any harm or damage inflicted upon it can have a greater impact on its population size, making the species even more vulnerable and rare. When a species has a small population, even seemingly minor threats can have a significant impact on their overall numbers. For example, if a rare species loses a small portion of its habitat, it may not be able to adapt and find a new suitable home, resulting in a further decrease in its population. Furthermore, a reduced population size also increases the likelihood of inbreeding and a decrease in genetic diversity. This lack of genetic variation makes it difficult for the species to adapt to changing conditions and increases their susceptibility to diseases and environmental stressors. In turn, this can further decrease the population size and exacerbate the rarity of the species. In conclusion, given the two facts above, harm to a rare species' population would increase the negative impact on its overall population size. The rarity and vulnerability of a species make it more susceptible to threats, and any harm inflicted on it can lead to further reductions in its population, making the species even rarer and driving it closer to the brink of extinction. Conservation efforts should thus focus on protecting and preserving rare species and their habitats to help maintain healthy population sizes and prevent further declines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the given process is: \\"Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth.\\" To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's breakdown the entire process of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, known as respiration, into a step-by-step description: 1. Inhalation of air through the nose or mouth: The process begins with the action of breathing in, or inhaling, air through the nose or mouth. This occurs as the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and moves downward. This contraction increases the amount of space within the chest cavity, lowering the air pressure and allowing air to be drawn in. 2. The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs: Once the air is inhaled, it travels down the trachea (windpipe) and enters the bronchial tubes, which are the branches of the airway that further divide into bronchioles, eventually leading to the lungs' air sacs called alveoli. 3. The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream: When the oxygen-rich air reaches the alveoli, it diffuses across the thin, moist membrane of the alveoli and the surrounding capillaries. Oxygen attaches to red blood cells containing hemoglobin, forming oxyhemoglobin, which is then transported through the bloodstream to supply the body's cells. 4. Circulates through the body: The oxygenated blood is pumped from the lungs by the left side of the heart, through the circulatory system of blood vessels. During this circulation, oxygen is supplied to the different cells, tissues, and organs of the body. 5. The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide: As oxygen is delivered to the cells, they utilize it in a process called cellular respiration to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During this process, cells generate carbon dioxide as a waste product. 6. The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs: The carbon dioxide produced by the cells diffuses into surrounding capillaries. It binds with hemoglobin, forming carbaminohemoglobin, which is then carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream, primarily through veins. 7. The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth: Once the blood carrying carbon dioxide reaches the lungs, the gas diffuses from the capillaries back into the alveoli. The diaphragm and other respiratory muscles then relax, causing the chest cavity to decrease in size. This increase in pressure forces the air, now containing carbon dioxide, out of the lungs and up the trachea, to be finally expelled from the body through the nose or mouth during exhalation. This entire process is crucial for maintaining appropriate oxygen levels in the body, ensuring that cells have the oxygen they need for energy production while efficiently removing carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in 1968.But handwritten notes purportedly from Sirhan, kept for 42 years by a Century City business executive, suggest that his behavior was calculated and controlled as he waited to shoot the presidential candidate in the hotel's kitchen pantry area.Michael McCowan was an investigator and the youngest member of Sirhan's defense team in 1969 when the accused assassin wrote the narrative of his visit to a target practice range and his later election-night trip to the hotel trip on a legal notepad.\\"He wrote it right in front of me,\\" said McCowan, now 78. Sirhan signed a second statement giving McCowan the rights to the documents, which next week will be sold by a Brentwood auction house.In March, Sirhan appeared before a parole board for his 14th hearing since his conviction in May 1969.The lawyer currently representing Sirhan suggested he was \\"manipulated\\" and \\"set up\\" and did not act alone when Kennedy was shot.William Pepper, who could not be reached Wednesday for comment at his New York office, said Sirhan did not remember the shooting because he was \\"hypno-programmed\\" to kill Kennedy.McCowan disagrees. \\"It never seemed to me to be a conspiracy. He wanted to be a martyr for the Palestinian cause,\\" he said of Sirhan.\\"Sirhan's not stupid. In his 10th-grade history book from his high school in Pasadena he'd underlined the assassination of President McKinley and on the next page of Archduke Ferdinand.\\"Sirhan had then written words to the effect that there would be many more such assassinations, McCowan said. \\"I think he wanted to be a martyr. To me, he was the first terrorist,\\" he said.Before volunteering for Sirhan's defense team, McCowan had been a Los Angeles police officer and earned his law degree. He offered to help defense lawyers \\"because everybody's entitled to a defense, to their day in court,\\" as he put it Wednesday.Along with the handwritten narrative, materials being sold in the online auction include a telegram from the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald , the killer of President John F. Kennedy , to Sirhan's mother, Mary Sirhan. \\"Please accept my sincerest and deepest sympathy,\\" Marguerite Oswald wrote in 1968.Many of those involved with Sirhan's trial are dead. McCowan is the last survivor from the defense team.In the trial's closing arguments, Sirhan lawyer Grant Cooper acknowledged that \\"we are not here to free a guilty man. He is guilty of having killed Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.\\"Sirhan was incapable of premeditation, added another of his lawyers, Russell Parsons, who praised the testimony of psychiatrists and psychologists who labeled Sirhan as a paranoid schizophrenic.Prosecutor Lynn Compton, a chief deputy district attorney, argued that the psychiactric expertise had \\"highly overcomplicated\\" the case. One psychologist had testified that Sirhan had been in some sort of hypnotic trance when he shot Kennedy.Sirhan, now 66 and serving a life sentence, was denied parole at last month's hearing. Deputy Dist. Atty. David Dahle, who represented prosecutors at the hearing, was out of town and could not be reached for comment Wednesday.But Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for his office, was a news reporter in 1968 who saw Kennedy moments before he was killed and then covered Sirhan's trial.She said the auction-bound narrative was never introduced as evidence. \\"Sirhan had a diminished-capacity defense,\\" Gibbons said. ||||| -- April 5, 2011 – LOS ANGELES, Calif. – Sirhan Sirhan’s audacious handwritten chronology meticulously describing his interactions at the Ambassador Hotel in downtown Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, before he killed presidential candidate Senator Robert F. Kennedy will be auctioned off at Nate D. Sanders’ Tuesday April 12, 2011 auction.This never before seen document is historically significant as it shows that Sirhan’s detailed description of his day at the Ambassador Hotel contradicts the defense team’s argument that the assassination was an impulsive act of a mentally disturbed man who suffered from amnesia or was hypnotized and thus would be unable to recall what happened.Sirhan records the events at the Ambassador Hotel prior to shooting Senator Kennedy in four pages of handwritten notes. In astonishing detail, he recounts the various people that he encounters on a hand-drawn intricate floor plan of the Ambassador’s Hotel’s ballroom. Sirhan places numbers on various rooms on the map, which refer to footnotes on the ensuing three pages, describing what he sees as he heads towards the fateful confrontation that would shock the world.Nate D. Sanders is also auctioning three other Sirhan Sirhan documents.They include Sirhan’s handwritten note in which he proposes strategies to his defense team on how he could fight the murder sentence, including a scenario of blackmailing President Lyndon Johnson, a handwritten alibi claiming that he was at a shooting range the day of the assassination and his trial jottings.The auction ends Tuesday, April 12, 2011 at 5 pm Pacific Daylight Savings Time.Additional information on the Sirhan documents can be found at http://natedsanders.com/ ItemInfo.asp?

Enterovirus infections are major etiological factors in myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Using an experimental murine model of this disease, previous studies have shown that myocarditis susceptibility depends upon activation of T lymphocytes expressing the gamma delta T cell receptor (TcR), and that only mouse strains which accumulate gamma delta T cells in the myocardium show apoptosis of myocytes or evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy-like disease. The objective of the present studies is to demonstrate that gamma delta T cells directly induce greater Fas-dependent apoptosis of cultured myocytes than T cells expressing the alpha beta TcR.', 'Bl.Tg.E alpha mice were infected for 7 days with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Hearts were removed and were either formalin-fixed, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for inflammation, and using TdT-TUNEL for apoptosis, or were minced and collagenase digested for isolation of gamma delta+ and alpha beta+ T cells using immunomagnetic bead separation. Neonatal cultures of cardiac myocytes were isolated from mice less than 2 days old by collagenase and pancreatin digestion, and were either untreated or infected with virus. Levels of Fas (CD95) were measured using FITC-conjugated hamster anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody and flow cytometry. Susceptibility of myocytes to Fas-dependent killing was measured by 51Cr-release by labeled myocytes incubated for 4 h on either 3T3-mock or 3T3-FasL transfected cell monolayers. Killing by T cells was also measured in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay. Fas-dependent and perforin-dependent cytotoxicity was determined by specific blocking using either Fas-Fc or concanamycin A.', 'Virally infected myocyte cultures showed significantly enhanced Fas expression compared to uninfected cells, with maximal upregulation of Fas occurring 18-24 h after virus infection. Both infected and uninfected myocytes were selectively killed by FasL-transfected 3T3 cells but not by mock control cells. Approximately 38% of CD3+ lymphocytes isolated from the heart express the gamma delta TcR with the remainder expressing the alpha beta TcR. Both gamma delta+ and alpha beta+ T cells lysed myocyte targets. Blocking studies indicate that gamma delta+ T cells induced predominantly Fas-mediated killing, while alpha beta+ cell produced more perforin-mediated death, although these effectors were capable of Fas-dependent killing as well.

The many found many aquamarine gemstones in the mine, but very few gold nuggets since the  Choose from: (1). gemstones were common.. (2). nuggets were common..","output":"The many found many aquamarine gemstones in the mine, but very few gold nuggets since the gemstones were common. This sentence implies that the individuals who were exploring the mine encountered an abundance of aquamarine gemstones, but gold nuggets were a rare find in this particular location. The reason behind the rarity of gold nuggets is that the aquamarine gemstones were more commonly found in the mine, due to factors that will be discussed further. Aquamarine gemstones and gold nuggets are both valuable materials that can be unearthed in mines, but their occurrence and prevalence can vary significantly. Factors, such as geological processes, the history of a region, and the mineral composition of a location, can contribute to the disparity in the availability of these resources. Aquamarine gemstones are a type of beryl mineral that is colored by iron traces. The mineral is found in granite rocks, as well as in some metamorphic rocks like mica schist and gneiss. Aquamarine gemstones are typically formed in pegmatite deposits or hydrothermal veins. The presence of aquamarine gemstones signifies that the mine in question has experienced geological conditions suitable for the formation of these minerals. Such conditions may have occurred due to tectonic movements, or the cooling and solidification of magma, which created the pegmatite deposits associated with aquamarine. On the other hand, gold nuggets are dense masses of gold that are found in alluvial deposits, as well as in quartz veins, and in deposits associated with hydrothermal activity. The formation of gold deposits requires specific conditions, such as a high temperature, the presence of mineral-rich fluids, and suitable pressure. Consequently, the rarity of gold nuggets in the mine could be due to the absence of these conditions in that particular area. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the presence of aquamarine gemstones was so extensive in the mine that they overshadowed the occurrence of gold nuggets. This could be because the specific geology of the mine was more conducive to the formation of aquamarine gemstones, rather than gold nuggets. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"gemstones were common\\" to provide a clear reason for the abundance of aquamarine gemstones and the scarcity of gold nuggets in the mine. This statement highlights the geological factors that contributed to the predominance of aquamarine gemstones in the mine, making gold nuggets a rarity in comparison."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's subtract the terms with 'r' on the right side: 436*r - 2767*r = -2331*r So, the equation now is: 1774*r = -2331*r + 303770 Next, we will isolate all terms with 'r' on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side of the equation. To do this, we add 2331*r to both sides of the equation to collect all 'r' terms on one side: 1774*r + 2331*r = 303770 This simplifies to: 4105*r = 303770 Finally, to solve for 'r', we will divide both sides of the equation by 4105 since on the left side 'r' is being multiplied by 4105: r = 303770 / 4105 When you perform the division, you get: r =~ 74.02751629499587 So, the solution for 'r' in the equation 1774*r = 436*r - 2767*r + 303770 is approximately 74.03 (rounded to two decimal places)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Only a 4-2 win over Hull on 3 May 2003 stopped the south Wales club from dropping out of the Football League. Three promotions and more than a decade of steady growth later, slipping into the second tier would arguably be no disgrace, given how far the Swans have come. But there is a lot more than just pride at stake as they battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League this season. Why? Because with the improved television deal that kicks-in from the 2016-17 season, can any club afford to go down? And as Deloitte's Football Money League report features 17 Premier League clubs in its top 30, the reported 26th-richest club in the world, Swansea, desperately want to stay in the top flight. The price agreed for domestic television coverage of the Premier League rose by 70% for the 2016-19 cycle, compared to 2013-16. The current deal, announced in 2012, amounts to £3.018bn over three years but the new agreement in February 2015 smashed that figure, totalling £5.136bn. And that excludes the money Premier League teams will receive for overseas television rights, which could be worth an additional £2bn in the current deal. As a result, the money clubs will receive for simply being in the Premier League from next season is set to increase on an astonishing scale. Last season's bottom club, Queens Park Rangers, were paid £68m over the course of last season, but in May 2017 the team finishing bottom can expect to receive around £100m - Chelsea received \\"just\\" £99m for winning the league in 2015. For Swansea, the potential ramifications of missing out on such large sums of money would be huge. For one thing, aspirations to develop and own the Liberty Stadium could go on hold and, inevitably, many of the players would be likely to move on. However, the effect on the local economy could be even more significant, in an area already hit by the news of 750 jobs being lost at the Tata Steel plant in the nearby town of Port Talbot. According to a study by the Welsh Economy Research Unit on Swansea City's promotion to the Premier League in 2011, their first season in the top division created an estimated 420 jobs - 120 of them in the hospitality industry. The hotel consultancy service PFK reported a 9% increase in overnight stays in the area and Swansea council reported that activity on its 'Visit Swansea' website was up 44% on the previous year. Swansea University then saw a significant increase in applications since the local football club joined the elite clubs, a fact vice-chancellor Professor Richard B Davies attributed to Premier League football \\"putting Swansea on the map\\". Emma Frearson Emmanuel, head of the International Office at Swansea University, said: \\"We have seen a 50% increase [in applications] over two years. \\"What we can't say is how many people apply to us directly because of the Swans, but certainly having a Premier League club in the city has been a big help, particularly internationally. \\"The Korean footballer Ki Sung-Yueng [Swansea midfielder] has an incredibly high profile in Korea, so obviously factors like that also raise awareness of the city abroad.\\" That Swansea now generate more revenue than former European Cup winners Ajax and Benfica highlights the financial power of being in the Premier League. The money the television deal of 2012 brought has seen a huge change in the liquidity of top-flight clubs. Paul Rawnsley of Deloitte's Sports Business Group, who has been involved with the analysing football finance for 15 years, added: \\"There has been a sea change in recent years with Premier League clubs becoming collectively profitable for the first time.\\" This is partly due to the fact that Premier League clubs are now only allowed to post limited losses under Uefa's Financial Fair Play requirements. But the guaranteed income of next season means this year's Championship play-off final, already the most lucrative one-off fixture in world football, will now be worth even more to the winners than the £90m earned by 2015 winners Norwich. After a lengthy search to replace Garry Monk in which Jenkins travelled to South America in search of candidates, Swansea have opted to appoint Italian Francesco Guidolin as head coach. The former Udinese boss, who will take charge of the Swans for this first time at Everton on Sunday, is a new face for the Premier League. His task is to keep the club in the top flight, at the expense of experienced Premier League managers such as Sunderland's Sam Allardyce and Newcastle's Steve McClaren. Jenkins has often been praised for getting his managerial appointments right - he will now desperately hope this season's unplanned change of first-team boss does not end up costing the club several tens of millions. What is a summary of this text?","output":"This article discusses the importance of Swansea City Football Club staying in the Premier League, not just for the potential earnings from next year's increased TV rights deal, but also for the local economy, which is already struggling with job losses. Swansea University has reported a significant increase in applications since the club joined the Premier League, highlighting the positive impact of having a top-flight football club on the city. The financial power of being in the Premier League also generates more revenue than other European clubs, which is crucial for the growth and development of the club. The bottom club next season is expected to receive around £100m from the increased TV deal, showing how important it is for Swansea City to avoid relegation this season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, is transmitted to its mammalian host by the tsetse. In the fly, the parasite's surface is covered with invariant procyclin, while in the mammal it resides extracellularly in its bloodstream form (BF) and is densely covered with highly immunogenic Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG). In the BF, the parasite varies this highly immunogenic surface VSG using a repertoire of ~2500 distinct VSG genes. Recent reports in mammalian systems point to a role for histone acetyl-lysine recognizing bromodomain proteins in the maintenance of stem cell fate, leading us to hypothesize that bromodomain proteins may maintain the BF cell fate in trypanosomes. Using small-molecule inhibitors and genetic mutants for individual bromodomain proteins, we performed RNA-seq experiments that revealed changes in the transcriptome similar to those seen in cells differentiating from the BF to the insect stage. This was recapitulated at the protein level by the appearance of insect-stage proteins on the cell surface. Furthermore, bromodomain inhibition disrupts two major BF-specific immune evasion mechanisms that trypanosomes harness to evade mammalian host antibody responses. First, monoallelic expression of the antigenically varied VSG is disrupted. Second, rapid internalization of antibodies bound to VSG on the surface of the trypanosome is blocked. Thus, our studies reveal a role for trypanosome bromodomain proteins in maintaining bloodstream stage identity and immune evasion. Importantly, bromodomain inhibition leads to a decrease in virulence in a mouse model of infection, establishing these proteins as potential therapeutic drug targets for trypanosomiasis. Our 1.25Å resolution crystal structure of a trypanosome bromodomain in complex with I-BET151 reveals a novel binding mode of the inhibitor, which serves as a promising starting point for rational drug design.

Summarize this article: A Peek at TV’s Future, Via Google Fiber      The Google Fiber experiment/maybe-not-an-experiment in Kansas City is important because it shows Google’s ability to compete directly with broadband providers for control of the Internet pipe itself.      If Google doesn’t need to rely on the Comcasts/Time Warner Cables of the world to connect with your computer, then all kinds of interesting stuff could happen — if Google really does want to get into the business of becoming a broadband provider.      Google says that’s the case, but it’s hard to imagine the company really following through. So, we’ll see.      Meantime, Google Fiber, which started rolling out to homes last week, also gives you a glimpse at what The TV Of The Future is supposed to look like. You turn on your set and can watch whatever you want, no matter who is sending out the signal: Broadcast TV, cable TV, Netflix, etc. (You’re probably going to pay for it the same way you do now, though.)      BTIG analysts Rich Greenfield and Walt Piecyk trekked out from New York City last week to get a hands-on demo of the TV service (registration required), and you can see a demo clip here.      It’s not a thrilling video, because it relies on still shots, but it does give you a sense of what the product actually looks like.      The big idea here is one we’ve also seen from other next-gen TV experiments, including Google TV, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo’s new console: One screen, many inputs, and a guide that simply lets you find whatever you want to watch, without having to worry about the source. If a mythical Apple TV ever shows up, it should do the same thing:      One other point: Note that the one thing you’d expect to see from Google in a TV product — YouTube — isn’t actually available yet. It’s supposed to show up next year, and the fact that it hasn’t yet is sort of astonishing, given YouTube’s stated ambition to compete directly with TV for eyeballs and ad dollars.      But bear in mind that for whatever reason, the Google org structure puts YouTube and Google TV in a completely different silo than Google Fiber. Internally, that must make sense in some Googley way. But it’s hard to fathom from the outside. ||||| After months of fanfare and anticipation, gigabit home Internet service Google Fiber finally went live on Tuesday in Kansas City. The search giant is offering 1Gbps speeds for just 70 per month—significantly faster and cheaper than what any traditional American ISPs are offering.      \\"We just got it today and I’ve been stuck in front of my laptop for the last few hours,\\" Mike Demarais, founder of Threedee, told Ars. \\"It’s unbelievable. I’m probably not going to leave the house.\\"      He lives in a four-bedroom house run by \\"Homes For Hackers\\" on Kansas City’s Hanover Heights neighborhood, just on the state border with Missouri. The house has become one of the hubs for the KC Startup Village, an informal group of entrepreneurs who have clustered around homes immediately eligible for Google Fiber.      Meanwhile, Demarais said that on an Ethernet connection, he’s seen consistent Google Fiber speeds of 600 to 700Mbps, with Wi-Fi topping out around 200Mbps. Even at the slower wireless speeds, that’s more than an order of magnitude faster than what most Americans have at home.      \\"The first thing I did was BitTorrent Ubuntu,\\" he said. \\"I think that took two minutes, let me try it again right now.\\"      Prior to Tuesday, Demarais—one of the house’s first two residents—said he’d been working out of local McDonald’s and Panera locations for their free Wi-Fi.      Mi Wi-Fi es tu Wi-Fi      The Homes For Hackers, founded by local Web developer Ben Barreth, had originally been conceived as a matchmaking scheme between entrepreneurs who wanted a free place to live and work, and local families who would open their homes to them. (Ars covered that effort back in August.)      But once Google announced its fiber rollout schedule, Barreth realized the families that had signed up were not going to get crazy speeds until Summer 2013. So he took matters into his own hands and, with his wife’s blessing, he liquidated his Roth IRA to put 20 percent down on a house they eventually bought for 48,000 in September 2012.      The couple has no plans to profit from the house. Instead, they want to use it as a way to nurture Kansas City’s nascent tech community. He’s letting entrepreneurs like Demarais live in the house rent-free and utilities-free for three months—they just have to pay for their own groceries.      \\"We’re strong, devout Christians,\\" Barreth told Ars. \\"I’ve been pushing on doors and a lot of doors have opened for me. I feel like this is what I’m supposed to do right now. It doesn't make a lot of financial sense but I really think it will benefit Kansas City. The whole reason why [we bought the house] was that no one in Kansas City was really exploiting fiber like we could be and this is the way I can bring in individuals that will exploit it. It helps that it’s not a really expensive house. [My wife] is a stay-at-home mom with two kids too, so we’re living off my one salary, and it’s still a strain. It’s a still a big strain.\\"      He anticipates getting donations, sponsorships, or, the most-likely scenario, renting out one of the bedrooms via AirBnB to the first Google Fiber \\"tourists\\"—people who might want to come for a day or two at a time to try it out.      \\"50 a night for 10 nights a month would cover mortgage and most of the utilities,\\" he said.      Barreth has been so busy dealing with local media requests that he hasn’t yet had a chance to use the connection himself—he and his family live about 20 minutes away from the second house, and their neighborhood was not included in the first rollout regions.      Kansas City, setting itself apart      Demarais said he knew he’s been spoiled: \\"Wherever I go after this, my Internet speed is going to be ruined.\\"      His company, Threedee, hopes to provide an added benefit to the growing 3D printing ecosystem.      \\"We’re building a front-end dev toolkit that lets developers view and manipulate 3D models in a browser,\\" he said. \\"We have an API that lets you communicate those models directly to 3D printers entirely in javascript without need to convert to a 3D model. We want to shake up manufacturing with tools that will allow people to buy products made for them.\\"      Demarais moved to Kansas City from Boston to work on his new startup—and while the move was driven in part by Google Fiber, being able to live rent-free for 90 days was huge.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Title: Oliver Twist Movie plot: A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist (John Howard Davies) by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble (Francis L. Sullivan) and matron Mrs. Corney (Mary Clare). At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry (Gibb McLaughlin), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger (Anthony Newley), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin (Alec Guinness), an old man who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow (Henry Stephenson), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. Fortunately, a witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin (Amy Veness). Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks (Ralph Truman), who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait. By chance, Fagin's associate, the vicious Bill Sykes (Robert Newton), and Sykes' kind-hearted prostitute girlfriend (and former Fagin pupil) Nancy (Kay Walsh) run into Oliver on the street and forcibly take him back to Fagin. Nancy feels pangs of guilt...

Two Pussy Riot members are now serving prison terms in remote penal colonies. The bill says blasphemy could incur up to three years in jail or a fine of up to 300,000 roubles (9,700;Â£6,300). Russian commentators say the bill appears to have strong backing from Mr Putin. It was passed by the Duma - Russia's lower house - in a first reading on Tuesday. To become law it has to pass two more readings in the Duma, then a vote in the upper house - the Federation Council - and get a final sign-off by Mr Putin. The entire parliament is dominated by Mr Putin's supporters. The text refers to offences against religions that are \\"an integral part of Russia's historical inheritance\\" - implying that it covers Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. Last August two Pussy Riot performers - Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova - were sentenced to two years each in jail for \\"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\\" over their obscenity-laced \\"punk prayer\\" against Mr Putin. The sentences provoked widespread international condemnation. Human rights activists and some critics of the new anti-blasphemy bill in the Duma say its wording is too vague and could lead to unjustified prosecutions. Yuri Sinelshchikov, a Communist MP and former prosecutor, warned that it could provoke \\"an outburst of combative atheism, in its most aggressive form, and enmity between believers and non-believers\\". Some human rights activists warned that \\"insults to believers\\" might include the teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution or the Big Bang theory about the universe.

There were no public systems of education before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. But now you need a Master's degree where the previous job required a Bachelor, and now you need a Ph.D. for the other. It's a process of academic inflation  , and it indicates the whole structure of education needs changing. All the great teachers I've ever met and worked with are people who can inspire interest and curiosity and light up people's imaginations with the interests they themselves have for a particular field of work. I mean, teaching is not only a process of giving people direct instructions and information they have to memorize, it is much more than that.  I believe our only hope for the future is to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children. And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face the future. By the way, we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.

To avoid freezing in his shack, Foghorn decides to woo Miss Prissy (\\"I need your love to keep me warm\\"), who lives in a warm, cozy cottage across the way. Miss Prissy is flattered by Foghorn's two-second courtship but tells him that, to prove his worthiness as her mate, he needs to show that he can be a worthy father to her bookish-looking son.

Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms.

It made landfall in northeastern Okinawa around 6:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 p.m. ET Saturday) with an eye that was nearly half the island's length. There were no immediate reports of damage. As of 9:50 p.m. ET, Samba was moving to the north at 30 kph (18 mph), the Japan Meteorological Association said. The storm has maximum sustained winds of estimated winds of 194 kph (120 mph) and gusts nearing 241 kph (149 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, the U.S. military agency responsible for issuing tropical storm warnings in the Pacific Ocean. Sanba is on track to make a direct hit on South Korea in a couple of days, the Korean Meteorological Association predicted, before moving up the Chinese coast. People in Okinawa and along the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain took serious precautions ahead of the storm. The infrastructure on the island is designed to withstand powerful storms, since the island is in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent. But storm surge could prove to be a problem for residents. \\"It's a large storm, and it's going to have a fairly wide-reaching effect,\\" CNN International weather anchor Jenny Harrison said. In the city of Ginowan in southern Okinawa on Saturday afternoon, skies were gray with dark clouds in the distance, according to video from CNN iReporter Kathryn Spoor. Even though it had weakened since Friday when it was briefly classified as a super typhoon, Sanba now has the same intensity as a Category 3 hurricane, meteorologists say. A Category 3, on a scale of 1 to 5, is a major hurricane with winds ranging from 111 to 129 mph. The storm is expected to have a far-reaching effect. It could cause serious flooding in the Philippine capital of Manila, for instance. Sanba is forecast to make a second landfall in mainland South Korea around noon local time Monday.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? In order to get along with people in conversation, you should avoid bragging about how great you are at work, tennis, or writing novels. If you’re really good at something, then people will be able to see that for themselves over time or they’ll hear about it from someone else. If you dominate the conversation by talking all about how awesome you are, then it’ll be hard to get along with people because they may think of you as self-absorbed and may get bored or even annoyed.  You can talk about your interests without talking about how great you are at them. There’s no need to mention any awards you won and it’ll make people cringe a little. Instead, praise the virtues of other people. That’s much more interesting to them. One key part of being a good conversationalist is taking the time to consider your words before they come out of your mouth. If you’re the kind of person who thinks before he speaks, or who even thinks by speaking, then it’s time to slow down and consider how your words will impact the people around you so you avoid offending people. It’s also a good trick because you may realize that you may be saying something just a little bit awkward or even boring to the people around you. Spend a few seconds forming a question in your head if you know it’s going to be of a sensitive nature. This is far better than blurting out something you may regret. A good conversationalist never takes over a conversation; instead, he knows how to get people talking and how to make them feel comfortable. If you want to get along with people, then you can’t go on and on about yourself; instead, you should talk enough to be interesting and winning, but make sure not to do more than roughly half the talking when you’re having a one-on-one convo so the other person doesn’t feel bored or uncared for.  If you’re in a group conversation, then you can tell a funny anecdote or two, but make sure other people contribute to the conversation. Let other people talk when they have something to say and don’t interrupt them just to prove them wrong. Even if someone is saying something a bit untrue, you should avoid the temptation to argue with every little thing he or she is saying. This won’t win you any friends and definitely won’t help you get along with people. Another way to get along with people more easily is to avoid topics that may cause people to get easily upset. These include abortion, gay rights, general political views, and controversial views on marriage or raising children. Once you get to know people better, you’ll be able to discuss more serious topics with them, but when you’re first trying to get along with people in conversation, you should stick to more agreeable topics, such as your weekend plans, your hobbies, or your favorite bands. If someone else brings up a sensitive topic, then it can help you get along with people if you can tactfully steer him or her away from that subject to something more user-friendly. Tact is key when it comes to getting along with people in a conversation. Having tact means choosing your words and your timing carefully. If you want to give someone personal advice, for example, you should do it when you’re alone so the person doesn’t feel embarrassed; the same goes for telling a person he has something stuck in his teeth. You should avoid making careless comments, like saying “Marriage is the most important part of life” to someone who has just been divorced, and you should always be sensitive to the feelings of others before you speak.  Another way to be tactful is to avoid revealing too much personal information to people you don’t know all that well. While you may feel like this will help you get along with people, it can actually push them away. Tactful people also acknowledge cultural differences when they talk to people. This can help you see whether or not your comments will be received well. Another great way to get along with people conversationally is to find common bonds to bring you closer together. As you talk to people, keep your ears open for hints that you might have similar interests; if it turns out you come from the same state, for example, then it may be a sign that you follow the same sports teams. Though you don’t have to have everything in common with the person you’re talking to, just finding one or two things to bond over, whether it’s your love of The Bachelor or your obsession with cooking pastries. Even if you and a person disagree about almost everything in the world, if you’re both 49ers fans, you can build an entire relationship out of that. Never underestimate how important it is to have something to bond over.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Open-Source A.W.S.: Creating a Thousand Clouds Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing service of Amazon.com, has sparked a boom in powerful and flexible computing over the Internet. Now the same technology is entering the corporate mainstream, through open-source cloud computing. In the past few years, companies and organizations like Open Nebula; the Open Stack alliance; Cloud.com, which is part of Citrix; and Eucalyptus have been offering various forms of the kind of software that works inside A.W.S. The idea of these free versions is to create smaller versions of the cloud, so people can do more with the computers in their own homes, institutions and businesses. If the company is big enough to have lots of partners, employees, and strong engineering talent, its open source cloud could amount to a supercomputer with lots of different capabilities, on the cheap. Like many open source projects, which depend on a core of engineers creating and then publicly releasing lots of complex software for free, there are a range of opinions about how to interact with the profit-making giants. Of all the versions, perhaps the most successful, as well as the friendliest to Amazon, is Eucalyptus, which easily shares data and computing chores with A.W.S. The idea is to give A.W.S. an ally in the open source world, giving customers of either Eucalyptus or A.W.S. the ability to move jobs on or off the clouds they own, depending on workload needs and internal security policies. “Like Amazon or not, they are the de facto standard for cloud,” says Marten Mickos, the chief executive of Eucalyptus. “It’s just that not everyone wants it. Some people in open source think it is immoral to make a profit. I don’t.” Mr. Mickos was previously the head of MySQL, an open source database company that was purchased by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) in 2008 for 1 billion. Eucalyptus originated with a project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but is clearly intended to be a profit-making business. Its customers include Puma, Sony, and the federal Department of Agriculture, and it counts over 25,000 clouds running on its software worldwide. Eucalyptus runs for free when customers use open source virtualization software, necessary for cloud computing, like Xen and KVM. When customers use the more popular products from VMWare, they must use Eucalyptus’s subscription product, which costs 2,000 per server a year. So far, fewer than 100 paying customers have shown up, but last year Mr. Mickos deployed teams in Europe, India and China. “There is more technology involved here than in MySQL, but the shift to cloud computing will be faster than the shift to open source was 10 years ago,” he says, adding that 21 of the 100 largest companies in the United States are experimenting with Eucalyptus. Mr. Mickos was a very visible hero of open source in the days before Sun bought MySQL. He left Sun before it was acquired by Oracle, which still offers the open source database as well as its proprietary products, but still keeps an eye on MySQL. “The product is technically better, and the sales are going well,” he says of Oracle MySQL. “But they don’t care about the community, their team for that is small, and they don’t invite outside people to comment on changes they make. It’s what you would expect.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how companies and organizations are offering free, open-source versions of cloud computing, similar to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Notice that for any two numbers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( x > y > 1 ), the inequality ( x^3 - y^3 > x^2 - y^2 ) holds. This inequality can be verified using basic algebraic principles. 2. We investigate the floor functions of the powers of ( a ) and ( b ). For this, we look at the absolute difference: [ left| a^m - b^n right| = left| left(sqrt{3^m}right)^3 - left(sqrt{2^n}right)^3 right| ] 3. Simplify the expression: [ left| a^m - b^n right| = left| 3^m - 2^n right| ] 4. Given ( 3^m ) and ( 2^n ) are integers and considering their parity, the difference between any two such expressions cannot be less than 1 because 3 raised to any positive integer power and 2 raised to any positive integer power remain distinct integers with a difference of at least 1: [ left| 3^m - 2^n right| geq 1 ] 5. Thus, the integer parts ( leftlfloor a^m rightrfloor ) and ( leftlfloor b^n rightrfloor ) must always be different for any positive integers ( m ) and ( n ). Hence, the problem statement is satisfied in this particular example. **Second Example:** Consider the numbers: [ a = 2 + sqrt{3} ] [ b = 3a ] 1. Define additional constants: [ c = 2 - sqrt{3} ] [ d = 3c ] 2. Using the Binomial Theorem, we can show that the expression ( A = a^m + c^m ) for any integer ( m ), where ( a = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( c = 2 - sqrt{3} ), results in an integer. The terms involving ( sqrt{3} ) cancel out due to symmetry in the binomial expansions: [ A = (2 + sqrt{3})^m + (2 - sqrt{3})^m ] 3. This sum is an integer because every term involving powers of ( sqrt{3} ) from the binomial expansions of ( (2 + sqrt{3})^m ) and ( (2 - sqrt{3})^m ) cancel each other out due to the opposite signs. 4. More specifically, all terms except those in the sequence which are multiples of 3 cancel out, leaving ( A ) to be non-multiples of 3 if ( m ) is not a multiple of 3. 5. Similarly, consider: [ B = b^n + d^n ] [ B = (3a)^n + (3c)^n = 3^n(a^n + c^n) ] Since ( a^n + c^n ) is an integer, ( B ) must also be an integer and clearly a multiple of 3. 6. Noting the magnitude of ( c ) and ( d ): [ 0 < c < 1 ] [ 0 < d < 1 ] 7. Consequently, the floor values differ by 1: [ leftlfloor a^m rightrfloor = A - 1 ] [ leftlfloor b^n rightrfloor = B - 1 ] Thus, ( leftlfloor a^m rightrfloor neq leftlfloor b^n rightrfloor ). # Conclusion: Such irrational numbers ( a ) and ( b ) do exist for which ( a > 1 ), ( b > 1 ), and ( leftlfloor a^m rightrfloor neq leftlfloor b^n rightrfloor ) for all natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ).

Given (|w| = 1), we rewrite the condition as:    [    |w|^n cdot |w - 1| = 1    ] 4. Since (|w| = 1), it means that (|w - 1| = 1). Points (w) and (w - 1) are on the unit circle. The only points on the unit circle such that (|w - 1| = 1) are (w = cos frac{pi}{3} pm i sin frac{pi}{3}), which correspond to (w_1) and (w_2) on the unit circle. 5. Then, we have:    [    w - 1 = cos frac{2pi}{3} pm i sin frac{2pi}{3}    ] 6.

Given each region overlaps, we can assume the total from all L-shaped regions covers full space once, and the sum of area which is actually L-shaped regions only (excluding center square) would be:    [    frac{3}{4} times 14,400 = 10,800 text{ square inches}    ] 4. **Find the area of the center square**:    The area not occupied by the L-shaped regions would then be the area of the center square:    [    14,400 - 10,800 = 3,600 text{ square inches}    ] 5. **Calculate the side length of the center square**:    If (s) is the side length of the center square:    [    s^2 = 3,600    ]    Solving for (s):    [    s = sqrt{3,600} = 60 text{ inches}    ]    Hence, the side length of the center square is 60 inches.

Also, the number of bananas Charles cooked was 3 times the number of pears he picked. If Charles picked 50 pears in 4 hours and cooked bananas in 2 hours, and Sandrine washed dishes in 5 hours, what are the rates r1, r2, and r3?","output":"Let's start by finding the rates r1, r2, and r3. First, we know that Charles picked 50 pears in 4 hours. To find the rate at which Charles picks pears (r1), we divide the total number of pears by the total time it took to pick them: r1 = number of pears / time = 50 pears / 4 hours = 12.5 pears per hour. Next, we know that the number of bananas Charles cooked (b) is 3 times the number of pears he picked. Since he picked 50 pears, the number of bananas he cooked is: b = 3 * number of pears = 3 * 50 = 150 bananas. Charles cooked these 150 bananas in 2 hours, so to find the rate at which Charles cooks bananas (r2), we divide the total number of bananas by the total time it took to cook them: r2 = number of bananas / time = 150 bananas / 2 hours = 75 bananas per hour. Now, we know that the number of dishes Sandrine washed (d) is 10 more than the number of bananas Charles cooked. So the number of dishes Sandrine washed is: d = b + 10 = 150 bananas + 10 = 160 dishes. Sandrine washed these 160 dishes in 5 hours, so to find the rate at which Sandrine washes dishes (r3), we divide the total number of dishes by the total time it took to wash them: r3 = number of dishes / time = 160 dishes / 5 hours = 32 dishes per hour.

When James and John combine their friends lists, they have a total of 275 people, but since they share 25 friends, we need to subtract these shared friends from the total to avoid double-counting. So the combined unique friends list is: [ 275 - 25 = 250 ] Now, we know that James has 75 friends, so the remaining number of friends must be John's (after removing the shared friends): [ 250 - 75 = 175 ] This number, 175, represents John's friends minus the 25 shared friends. To find the total number of John's friends, we add back the shared friends: [ 175 + 25 = 200 ] So John has 200 friends. Now we can find the ratio of John's friends to James's friends: [ frac{John's friends}{James's friends} = frac{200}{75} ] To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 25: [ frac{200 div 25}{75 div 25} = frac{8}{3} ] So the ratio of John's friends to James's friends is ( boxed{8:3}  )."},{"instruction":"a country with 100 cities and several roads, each road connects two cities, and the roads do not intersect. You can travel from any city to any other city using the roads. Prove that it is possible to designate some of the roads as main roads such that an odd number of main roads leave each city.","output":"1. **Step 1: Understand the problem setup.**        We are given a country with 100 cities. Each city is connected to other cities by roads, and from any city, it is possible to reach any other city by traveling along these roads. We need to prove the existence of a selection of \\"main roads\\" such that each city is connected by an odd number of these main roads. 2. **Step 2: Parity Argument and Matching Theory.**    To approach this problem, let’s look at graph theory. Here, our country with cities and roads can be visualized as a connected, undirected graph (G = (V, E)) with (V) representing the 100 cities and (E) representing the roads. 3. **Step 3: Hamiltonian Path idea.**    Begin by considering a subset of roads such that every city connects to every other city. This implies our graph needs to maintain connectivity. One method is to create pairs of cities, then connect each pair with a unique road. This can be imagined as forming a perfect matching of cities, ensuring there’s a pairing for 50 pairs (since 100 cities). 4. **Step 4: Constructing the odd-degree nodes in the matching.**    For each road in this matched graph, count the paths or \\"routes\\" that pass through them. When constructing these pairings:    - Each individual \\"main route\\" contributes 1 to the parity count of its cities (the endpoints).    - Remaining connections contribute either 0 or 2 because they either do not affect or they preserve the even nature of going in one way and back another.         Thus, when you sum these, each pair contributes an odd number because 1 is odd, and adding 0s or 2s does not change the parity of being odd. 5. **Step 5: Summing the parities.**        Since each city's odd-degree is maintained via this pair-contribution method, and the sum for each city remains an odd number regarding road connections, this meets our requirement. 6. **Step 6: Conclusion.**        By declaring the roads from step 4 as \\"main roads\\", we ensure that each city involves an odd number of these main roads. Therefore, we have shown that it is possible to select roads among the cities such that each city's outgoing roads are odd in count.

If any integer ( k ) between ( m ) and ( M ) is missing, then we could find ( a = m ), ( b = k ), and ( c = M ) satisfying the property.        - The number of such subsets is determined by choosing any two elements ( m ) and ( M ) from ( {1, 2, ldots, 2019} ), where ( m ) is the smallest and ( M ) is the largest, thus forming a biunivocal consecutive sequence. The number of such subsets is:        [        binom{2019}{2}        ] 3. **Final Calculation**:     We subtract the number of subsets without the desired property from the total number of subsets to find the number of subsets that do possess the property.

These roots divide the number line into three intervals: (-infty, 0), (0, 2), and (2, +infty). Testing values from each interval in the inequality x(x-2) < 0, we find that the inequality holds for 0 < x < 2. Thus, A={x|0 < x < 2}. 3. **Define Set B**: The set B is given directly as B={-1,0,1,2}. 4. **Find the Intersection Acap B**: To find the intersection of sets A and B, we look for elements that are common to both sets. Since A includes numbers strictly between 0 and 2, and B includes the numbers {-1,0,1,2}, the only number from B that falls within the interval for A is 1. Therefore, Acap B={1}.

Rewrite the equation of the circle in the standard form to find its center and radius. The given equation is x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+2y-2=0. Completing the squares, we get:    [    (x+1)^{2} - 1 + (y+1)^{2} - 1 - 2 = 0 implies (x+1)^{2} + (y+1)^{2} = 4    ]    Therefore, the center of the circle C is (-1,-1) and the radius r=2. 2.

This is because adding the largest integers not greater than x and y separately cannot exceed the largest integer not greater than their sum.  By rearranging this inequality, we get left[xright]leqslant left[x+yright]-left[yright].  Substituting x with x-y, we obtain left[x-yright]leqslant left[xright]-left[yright].  Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B:** Consider an example where y=-1 and x=2. In this case, left|frac{left[yright]}{left[xright]}right| = left|frac{-1}{2}right| = frac{1}{2} leqslant 1, which satisfies the given condition. However, |x-y| = |2-(-1)| = |3| = 3 > 1.

We are given that ( B + L = 130 ). 2. Each tree has a sign stating \\"Next to it grow two different trees.\\" This statement is false for all lindens and exactly one birch. 3. Consider the grouping possibilities of birches and lindens.     - Suppose there exists any group of at least 2 consecutive lindens.     - Based on the problem conditions, one of the two consecutive lindens would have the sign stating \\"Next to it grow two different trees.\\" This would be true according to the sign definition since it would be surrounded by different trees (at least one birch and one linden), but this contradicts the given condition that the sign is false for all lindens.     - Consequently, it implies that there cannot be any group of consecutive lindens larger than one tree. 4. Therefore, every linden is placed between two birches.     - This means every linden has false signs, validating the given condition. 5. Now let's analyze the groups of birches:     - If there is at least one group of birches with ( k ) birches where ( k geq 4 ), then among them all but the two end birches will have signs which state \\"Next to it grow two different trees\\", which will be false since each birch would lie between two birches. This would be a contradiction if there is exactly one false birch.     - If there is a group with exactly 3 birches, only the middle birch’s sign will be false (it lies between two birches and next to one linden), which aligns with our condition as there’s exactly one such birch. 6. If there is a single birch, ( B = 1 ), then it must meet ( (N-1) = L = 2). This logic fails as shown early in mutually exclusive logical flow. Meaning, there is no such possibility. 7. So we can only have groups of two birches (here each true) and one group of three birches in the circular sequence. Combining:     - Suppose we have a group of ( 3 ) consecutive birches where the central birch states the false condition.     - Rest are in cycles of each sequence of two birches around and in-between them linden (true). 8.

Set arccos x = 2arcsin x and solve:    [    arccos x = 2arcsin x implies x = sinleft(frac{arccos x}{2}right)    ]    Use the identity: sin(2theta) = 2sinthetacostheta and sin(arccos x) = sqrt{1-x^2}:    [    x = sinleft(frac{arccos x}{2}right) = sqrt{frac{1+cos(arccos x)}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1+x}{2}}    ]    Solve x = sqrt{frac{1+x}{2}}:    [    x^2 = frac{1+x}{2} implies 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0 implies x = frac{1 pm sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    Out of these two roots, frac{1+sqrt{3}}{2} violates the domain restrictions as it is more than 1. Hence, viable solution point is x = frac{1-sqrt{3}}{2}. 4. Check if arccos x > 2arcsin x holds before this root:    Evaluate arccos x and 2arcsin x at points near x = frac{1-sqrt{3}}{2}. Since arccos x starts higher at x=-1 and is a decreasing function, while 2arcsin x begins at -pi and increases, arccos x > 2arcsin x for x < frac{1-sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, the set of all x such that arccos x > 2arcsin x is (boxed{(-1, frac{1-sqrt{3}}{2}]})."},{"instruction":"Professor Ana went to buy cheese bread to honor the students awarded in the OBMEP, and:  Each 100 grams of cheese bread costs R  3.20 and corresponds to 10 pieces of cheese bread.

Each cross consists of 5 unit squares arranged such that there's a center square with one square extending from each side (up, down, left, right). 2. **Determine Necessary Coordinates for Seven Marks**:    Thank you for mentioning the coordinates. We map them out to understand the coverage of each Swiss cross more easily. Here let’s visualize these coordinates on the 7 times 7 grid:        (2,5), (3,2), (3,3), (4,6), (5,4), (6,2), (6,5)        These coordinates are distributed over the grid such that any Swiss cross centered at these points must cover at least one marked unit square. 3. **Determine Sufficiency of Seven Marks**:    - **Visual Representation of Swiss crosses**:      If we place a Swiss cross with its center at, for example, (2,5), it covers (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5).            Similarly, we place crosses at each of the mentioned coordinates and see that they will sufficiently ensure any other Swiss cross covers at least one marked square. 4. **Verify the Necessity of Seven Marks**:    - We now need to check whether fewer than 7 markings can still satisfy the condition.        - Consider Swiss crosses centered at the coordinates:            (2,2), (2,6), (3,4), (5,2), (5,6), (6,4)                 These are all disjoint (i.e., no two crosses centered here overlap with each other). Each cross must cover at least one marked square. Thus, marking fewer than 7 squares would result in at least one of these crosses not covering a marked square. 5. **Argument if Only Six Squares Were Marked**:    - If we mark exactly 6 squares, each must be covered by one of the crosses centered at {(2,2),(2,6),(3,4),(5,2),(5,6),(6,4)}.    - Some positions are constrained logically. For example:         - Squares such as (4,4) would play a central role in being marked always.         - Some required non-central squares must also be marked which would make sure each Swiss cross covers a mark.      Logically, testing such constraints shows contradictions since:      - Not every placement is guaranteed this condition. 6. **Conclusion**:    Thus, we conclude logically that a 7 marked unit square pattern on this 7 times 7 grid ensures that each Swiss cross will cover at least one marked square and fewer than 7 marks will not suffice.

We sum all the quotients to get the total number of times 3 appears as a factor in 22!. 22 ÷ 3 = 7 (we ignore the remainder) 7 ÷ 3 = 2 (again, we ignore the remainder) Adding these up, we get 7 + 2 = 9.

So, Ted gathered boxed{10}  blue mushrooms."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],F={key:0},N={key:1};function H(i,e,h,m,o,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),n(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(f,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
