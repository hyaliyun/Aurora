Find the smallest k that is sufficient for any given initial polygon.","output":": 1. **Example Consideration:** We start by proving that five points are enough. Consider four consecutive vertices ( A, B, C, D ) of a regular polygon (possibly ( A = D )). Mark the points ( A ), ( B ), a random point ( X ) on the side ( AB ), a point ( Y ) on the side ( BC ), close enough to ( B ), and a point ( Z ) on the side ( CD ), close enough to ( C ). 2. **Contradiction Setup:** Suppose ( P ) is the initial regular polygon and ( Q ) is an arbitrary regular polygon containing the five marked points ( A, B, X, Y, Z ) on its perimeter. Let ( alpha ) and ( beta ) denote the angles of these polygons. The line segment ( AB ) must contain one side of the polygon ( Q ) because it contains three marked points. Let this side be ( A'B' ). 3. **Geometric Reasoning:** Now, consider the side of ( Q ) that contains point ( Y ), and let this side lie on line ( l ). Consequently, points ( B ) and ( Z ) must lie on one side of this line ( l ). 4. **Analysis of Proximity:** As ( Z ) is close to ( C ), the angle between the line ( l ) and the side ( BC ) must be small. Recall: [ alpha = angle ABY geq angle A'B'Y geq beta ] This implies that the number of sides of ( Q ) is not greater than that of ( P ). 5. **Alignment Condition:** Therefore, the angle between ( l ) and ( BC ) can be small only if these lines coincide. Hence, the line ( BC ) must also contain a side of ( Q ), and point ( B ) must be a vertex of ( Q ). It follows that ( P ) and ( Q ) are centrally symmetric about point ( B ), and the contour of ( Q ) includes point ( Z ) only if ( P ) and ( Q ) coincide. 6. **Insufficient Points Argument:** Next, prove that four points are insufficient for large ( n ). Assume three of the points lie on the same side ( AB ) of polygon ( P ). A regular triangle built on ( AB ) lies entirely within ( P ), making the fourth marked point outside. Applying homothethy to this triangle with a center at the midpoint of ( AB ) and a suitable coefficient greater than 1, the fourth marked point can be placed on its contour, preventing the unique reconstruction of ( P ). 7. **Convex Quadrilateral Argument:** Now, consider that the marked points form a convex quadrilateral ( ABCD ) that is nearly inscribed.

We can write the following equations based on their speeds and the distances they cover: For a and b: [ v_a cdot t_a = 1000 ] (1) [ v_b cdot t_a = 900 ] (2) For a and c: [ v_a cdot t_a = 1000 ] (1) [ v_c cdot t_a = 850 ] (3) We can solve equation (1) for ( t_a ): [ t_a = frac{1000}{v_a} ] Now, we can substitute ( t_a ) into equations (2) and (3) to find the speeds of b and c in terms of the speed of a: [ v_b = frac{900}{t_a} = frac{900}{frac{1000}{v_a}} = frac{900 cdot v_a}{1000} = 0.9 cdot v_a ] (4) [ v_c = frac{850}{t_a} = frac{850}{frac{1000}{v_a}} = frac{850 cdot v_a}{1000} = 0.85 cdot v_a ] (5) Now, let's find the head start that b would need to give c in a kilometer race. We want to find a distance ( d ) such that b and c would finish the race at the same time if b runs 1000 meters and c runs ( 1000 - d ) meters. Let ( t ) be the time it takes for both b and c to finish the race with the head start. We can write: [ v_b cdot t = 1000 ] (6) [ v_c cdot t = 1000 - d ] (7) Using equations (4) and (5), we can substitute ( v_b ) and ( v_c ) into equations (6) and (7): [ 0.9 cdot v_a cdot t = 1000 ] (8) [ 0.85 cdot v_a cdot t = 1000 - d ] (9) Now, we can solve equation (8) for ( t ): [ t = frac{1000}{0.9 cdot v_a} ] Substitute ( t ) into equation (9): [ 0.85 cdot v_a cdot frac{1000}{0.9 cdot v_a} = 1000 - d ] [ 0.85 cdot frac{1000}{0.9} = 1000 - d ] [ frac{850}{0.9} = 1000 - d ] [ 944.44 approx 1000 - d ] [ d approx 1000 - 944.44 ] [ d approx 55.56 ] So, b would need to give c a head start of approximately boxed{55.56} meters in a kilometer race."},{"instruction":"f x^2+x6geq0, then x>2.

The faster train passes the slower train in 72 seconds. What is the length of each train?","output":"Let's denote the length of each train as L (in kilometers). Since the trains are running in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference in their speeds. The relative speed is 56 km/hr - 36 km/hr = 20 km/hr. To find the length of the trains, we need to convert the relative speed into meters per second because the time taken to pass is given in seconds. We know that 1 km/hr is equal to 5/18 m/s. So, the relative speed in meters per second is: 20 km/hr * (5/18) m/s/km/hr = (20 * 5/18) m/s = (100/18) m/s ≈ 5.56 m/s The time taken for the faster train to pass the slower train is 72 seconds. The distance covered by the faster train in this time is the combined length of both trains, which is 2L (since both trains are of equal length). Using the formula for distance (Distance = Speed * Time), we can write: 2L = Relative Speed * Time Taken to Pass Substituting the values we have: 2L = 5.56 m/s * 72 s Now, we solve for L: 2L = 400.32 m Dividing both sides by 2 to find the length of one train: L = 400.32 m / 2 L = 200.16 m Therefore, the length of each train is approximately boxed{200.16} meters."},{"instruction":"Find the coordinates of one of the foci of the hyperbola given by the equation: [2x^2 + 3y^2 8x 24y 4 = 0.]","output":"To find the standard form of the equation of the hyperbola, we first complete the square for both (x) and (y): [begin{aligned} -2(x^2 + 4x) + 3(y^2 - 8y) - 4 &= 0 -2(x^2 + 4x + 4) + 3(y^2 - 8y + 16) - 4 &= -8 + 48 -2(x+2)^2 + 3(y-4)^2 &= 36 frac{(y-4)^2}{12} - frac{(x+2)^2}{18} &= 1. end{aligned}] This fits the standard form of the hyperbola (frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a^2 = 12), (b^2 = 18), (h = -2), and (k = 4).

This is because for any odd function f(x), f(-x) = -f(x), and thus g(-x) = -xf(-x) = xf(x) = g(x), confirming that g(x) is even. Next, we examine the behavior of g'(x) when x > 0. Given that f'(x) + frac{f(x)}{x} > 0, we can rewrite this as: [f'(x) + frac{f(x)}{x} = frac{xf'(x) + f(x)}{x} > 0] This simplifies to: [xf'(x) + f(x) > 0] Which means: [g'(x) > 0] This indicates that g(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +infty).

Given the natural logarithm values, we know that 0 = ln 1 < ln 2 < ln e = 1, which implies ln 2 < 1 < 2.

First, find the number of perfect squares less than or equal to 2500. The greatest perfect square less than or equal to 2500 is 50^2 = 2500. Therefore, the sequence of S(n) will be determined by the sequence 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 50^2. The parity of S(n) for an interval between two consecutive squares m^2 and (m+1)^2 will be the same, and it will change when crossing over each square (since only perfect squares contribute to odd tau(n)). Now, split between odd and even squares: - Interval counts from 1^2 to 2^2, 3^2 to 4^2, ... , 49^2 to 50^2 control a (odd). - Interval counts from 2^2 to 3^2, 4^2 to 5^2, ..., 48^2 to 49^2 control b (even).

Part (a) The main idea is to use the asymmetry of the card backs to encode information about the suits to the psychic. Here's a step-by-step explanation. 1. **Coding the Suit of the Second Card:** The helper can use the orientation of the first two card backs to encode the suit of the second card. There are 4 possible suits, and the helper can arrange the first two cards in such a way (for example, face up vs. face down) to represent these 4 suits uniquely. 2. **Generalizing This Coding:** The helper will continue to use pairs of card backs to encode the suit of every second card in the sequence. For instance, the third and fourth card backs can encode the suit of the fourth card, and so on. Given the pattern: [ (1, 2) to text{Suit of Card 2}, (3, 4) to text{Suit of Card 4}, (5, 6) to text{Suit of Card 6}, ldots ] We can see that every pair encodes the suit of the second card in that pair. 3. **Handling Special Cases:** When only two cards remain, the psychic will know the remaining suits because they have observed 34 out of the 36 cards and will know which suits are missing. The helper can use the orientation of the 35th card to encode which of the last two cards has a higher rank (arbitrarily assigned before starting). This helps in identifying the exact order of the last two cards. 4. **Conclusion of Part (a):** Thus, the psychic can guess the suits of at least (36 - (36 / 2)) = 18 cards correctly. With the additional encoding of the final cards, it accurately guesses at least 19 cards. [ boxed{19 text{ cards}} ] Part (b) This part extends the strategy used in Part (a) by utilizing a refined approach and application of the pigeonhole principle to ensure at least 23 cards’ suits are guessed correctly. 1. **Creating Odd and Even Sets:** Label the cards as follows: - (1, 3, 5, ldots, 35) are odd-position cards. - (2, 4, 6, ldots, 34) are even-position cards. - Card 2 will be specially encoded later. 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** Consider the 17 odd-position cards excluding the first and penultimate odd cards and including Card 2. - According to the pigeonhole principle, within any 17 chosen cards, at least 5 will belong to the same suit since there are only 4 suits. 3. **Encoding the Main Suit:** - The helper uses the orientations of the first two cards to encode the predominant suit (the observed suit of the 5 cards in the chosen set). 4. **Detailed Encoding for Subsequent Cards:** - For each pair (2k-1, 2k), encode the suit of the 2kth card by the combination of orientations. This is applicable for 2 leq k leq 17. 5. **Decoding the Last Two Cards’ Suits:** - Similar to Part (a), the position of the last penultimate card (35th card) will encode the suit of the remaining cards. 6. **Outcome:** - The psychic can therefore accurately guess the main suit in each of the 17 chosen cards, at least 5 of them being the same suit. - Including the suits of all even-position cards except the second and last ones: [ 5 text{ offset odd-position cards} + 17 text{ even-position cards excluding 2nd and last} + 2 text{ last pairs} = 5 + 16 + 2 = 23 ] [ boxed{23 text{ cards}} ] # Conclusion: The psychic can guess at least 19 cards’ suits correctly using simple coding strategies and can guess at least 23 cards’ suits correctly by using a more complex strategy and the pigeonhole principle.

If the saucer is initially at point ( A ), it jumps to point ( A' ) such that either the Moon or the Earth is at the midpoint of ( AA' ). - If initially in position ( L_{1} ) relative to the Moon, after the jump, the midpoint of the segment between the starting and ending points of the jump lies at Moon's point. - We denote the displacement of the saucer by the vector ( overrightarrow{L_1 L_2} ). After two jumps, the total displacement is given by ( 2 overrightarrow{L_1 L_2} ). 3. **Composition of Symmetries**: By performing two such jumps, the composition of central symmetries results in a parallel translation by the vector ( 2 overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ). - For any two points ( X ) and ( Y ) inside the Moon’s orbit, we can always find a chord such that ( overrightarrow{XY} = 2 overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ). - This chord can be constructed by drawing a diameter of the circle parallel to the line ( overrightarrow{XY} ), and then laying off a segment of length ( frac{1}{2} XY ) such that its midpoint coincides with the center of the circle, followed by drawing perpendiculars from the ends of this segment and extending them to find the chord ( overrightarrow{L_{1} L_{2}} ). 4. **Conclusion for (a)**: After two jumps, the flying saucer will have moved by twice the vector between the centers of the Earth and Moon. This ensures that from any point inside the lunar orbit, it is possible to move to any other point inside the orbit in two jumps.

Given the focal length is 4, we infer that a > 2 because the focal length (2c) is less than the length of the major axis. 2. **Determine the Position of Foci**: Since the focal length is given as 4, and by the nature of the ellipse, the foci are on the axis with the larger denominator under the variable. The focal length being 4 suggests the foci are on the y-axis, making m^2 the larger denominator and thus part of the major axis calculation. 3. **Apply the Ellipse Focal Length Formula**: For an ellipse, the relationship between the semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the focal length 2c is given by c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Given the focal length is 4, we have 2c = 4 which implies c = 2. Substituting c = 2 into the formula gives 4 = a^2 - b^2. 4. **Solve for a**: Since the foci lie on the y-axis, we have a^2 = m^2.

The total runs scored by the batsman in 60 innings is 60 * 55 = 3300 runs.

The total runs scored in these 58 innings is 58 * 52 = 3016 runs. Now, we can find the sum of the highest and lowest scores by subtracting the total runs of the 58 innings from the total runs of the 60 innings: 3300 runs (total for 60 innings) - 3016 runs (total for 58 innings) = 284 runs.

What is the minimum number of weighings needed to definitely find the heaviest coin?","output":"To find the heaviest coin when there are n coins (n > 2), given that: 1. We have n coins of different weights. 2. We have n scales, one of which is defective (i.e., it sometimes shows incorrect results but we do not know which one). The minimum number of comparisons required to definitely find the heaviest coin is (2n - 1) comparisons. Let's prove this using mathematical induction. Base Case: When (n = 2): - We have 2 scales and 2 coins. - Perform one comparison using the two scales to compare the two coins, placing one coin on each side. - If any comparison shows a balance, the scale used is defective. - Use the other scale to compare the two coins again. The result of the second comparison, compared with the first, can identify the heavier coin reliably. Thus, for (n = 2), the required number of comparisons is (2 cdot 2 - 1 = 3). Induction Hypothesis: Assume the proposition holds for (n - 1), (i.e.), with (n - 1) coins, the heaviest coin can be identified with (2(n - 1) - 1) comparisons. Induction Step: Consider (n) coins: 1. Select any two coins and use any two scales to compare them twice (each scale used once per coin) to determine the consistently heavier coin of the two, if possible. Let the coins be (a) and (b), and the scales are (S_1) and (S_2). Fix coin (a) on the left, (b) on the right on both scales. 2. Assume one of the coins is found consistently heavier. Designate this coin as (a) (without loss of generality). Note that (a) is likely heavier than (b). The defective scale cannot impact both comparisons equally and consistently. If consistent results are achieved, fix (a) as the heavier coin in both comparisons. 3. After two comparisons, set aside coin (b) and consider the remaining (n-2) coins including the identified heavier coin (a). 4. Use the induction hypothesis: it requires (2(n-1) - 1) comparisons to identify the heaviest among these (n-1) coins. 5. Adding the initial two comparisons, we get (2(n-1) - 1 + 2 = 2n - 1) comparisons.

Prove your conclusion.","output":"1. **Initial Step**: We need to show that it is possible to gather all the candies into one plate by performing a finite number of operations. 2. **Reduction to Three Plates**: Initially, consider the scenario where we have three plates ( A, B, ) and ( C ) containing ( a, b, ) and ( c ) candies respectively, such that ( 0 < a leq b leq c ). - Perform the operation ( a ) times: [ (a, b, c) rightarrow (a-1, b-1, c+2) rightarrow cdots rightarrow (0, b-a, c+2a) ] - After these operations, the total number of plates containing candies decreases by one if ( a neq b ), or by two if ( a = b ). - Therefore, we can reduce the problem to at most three plates with candies. 3. **Reduction to Two Plates**: - Assume all the candies are now in three plates ( A, B, ) and ( C ), with each plate containing ( a, b, ) and ( c ) candies where ( a geq b geq c geq 0 ). - Introduce a fourth empty plate ( D ).

The inlet pipe fills the tank at a rate of 3 cubic inches/min, while the two outlet pipes empty the tank at rates of 9 cubic inches/min and 6 cubic inches/min respectively. The net rate of emptying the tank is the sum of the rates of the outlet pipes minus the rate of the inlet pipe: Net emptying rate = (9 + 6) - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 cubic inches/min Now, we know that it takes 4320 minutes to empty the tank at this net rate.

To do this, we need to count the number of factors of 3 in ( 25! ). The number of factors of 3 in ( 25! ) can be found by the following method: - Divide 25 by 3 to count the multiples of 3: ( lfloor frac{25}{3} rfloor = 8 ) - Divide 25 by 9 to count the multiples of 9 (since each multiple of 9 contributes an extra factor of 3): ( lfloor frac{25}{9} rfloor = 2 ) - Divide 25 by 27 to count the multiples of 27 (since each multiple of 27 contributes yet another factor of 3): ( lfloor frac{25}{27} rfloor = 0 ) (since 27 is greater than 25, there are no multiples of 27 in ( 25! )) Adding these up, we get ( 8 + 2 + 0 = 10 ). So, ( 25! ) has 10 factors of 3, which means the greatest value of n for which ( 3^n ) is a factor of ( 25! ) is 10. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. We want to find the greatest value of k such that ( 3^k ) divides the difference between ( 25! - 3^n ). Since ( 3^n ) is a factor of ( 25! ), the difference ( 25! - 3^n ) will be some multiple of ( 3^n ). However, we want ( 3^k ) to divide this difference, and ( k < n ). Since ( 3^n ) is a factor of ( 25! ), the difference ( 25! - 3^n ) will be a multiple of ( 3^n ) minus ( 3^n ), which is ( 3^n(3^0) ). This means that the difference is divisible by ( 3^n ), but since ( k < n ), the greatest value of k for which ( 3^k ) divides the difference is ( n - 1 ). Therefore, the greatest value of n for which ( m = 3^n ) is a factor of ( 25! ) is boxed{10,} and the greatest value of k for which ( 3^k ) divides the difference between ( 25! - m ) is ( n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9 )."},{"instruction":"A lattice point is a point whose coordinates are both integers.

Substituting y=x into y=-x^2+6 gives us x=-x^2+6. Rearranging, we get x^2+x-6=0.

Note that it simplifies to: [ (y - z)(x^2 - xz - xy + yz) = (x - y)(x - z)(y - z) ] 11. Hence, the inequality can be equivalently written as: [ (x - y)(x - z)(y - z) leq 0 ] 12. If at least two numbers among ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) are equal, the inequality converts to equality and holds true. Assume ( x leq y leq z ): - The function: [ f(t) = t^{2010} + pt + q ] - Its derivative: [ f'(t) = 2010t^{2009} + p ] - The function ( f(t) ) decreases when ( t < t_0 = sqrt[2000]{-frac{p}{2010}} ) and increases when ( t > t_0 ). 13.

If ( z > y > t_0 ), from the previous argument: [ x = f(z) > z = f(y) Rightarrow text{Contradiction} ] 15. Therefore, no original configuration contradicts the derived inequality. In conclusion, the problem statement holds true under both cases for the inequality.

Suppose these are points (A) and (B), with (A) being to the east of (B). 3. **Orient the Lamps of Northern Points**: - Point the lamp at (A) towards the southwest.

Prove that if cos (k1)x and cos kx are rational, then there exists a positive integer n>k , such that both cos (n1)x and cos nx are rational.","output":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We need to prove that if cos((k-1)x) and cos(kx) are rational for a positive integer k geq 3 and a real number x, then there exists a positive integer n > k such that both cos((n-1)x) and cos(nx) are rational. 2. **Using properties of cosine**: Recall that cos(nx) can be expressed as a polynomial in cos(x) with integer coefficients. This is derived from the multiple-angle formulas for cosine. Specifically, for any integer n, cos(nx) can be written as: [ cos(nx) = T_n(cos(x)) ] where T_n is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. 3. **Rationality of cosine values**: Given that cos((k-1)x) and cos(kx) are rational, we can use the fact that if cos(a) is rational, then cos(na) is also rational for any integer n. This follows from the polynomial relationship mentioned above. 4. **Finding integers p and q**: Since k and k-1 are coprime (i.e., gcd(k, k-1) = 1), by the properties of coprime integers, there exist infinitely many pairs of positive integers (p, q) such that: [ p(k-1) - qk = 1 ] This is a result of the linear Diophantine equation, which has solutions because k and k-1 are coprime. 5. **Choosing appropriate p and q**: We need to find such p and q such that both p(k-1) and qk are greater than k. This ensures that n = p(k-1) is greater than k. 6. **Constructing n**: Let n = p(k-1). Then, from the equation p(k-1) - qk = 1, we have: [ n - 1 = qk ] Therefore, n-1 is a multiple of k, and since p(k-1) > k, we have n > k. 7. **Rationality of cos((n-1)x) and cos(nx)**: Since n-1 = qk, cos((n-1)x) = cos(qkx), and cos(nx) = cos(p(k-1)x). Given that cos(kx) and cos((k-1)x) are rational, and using the polynomial relationship, cos(qkx) and cos(p(k-1)x) are also rational. 8. **Conclusion**: We have found a positive integer n > k such that both cos((n-1)x) and cos(nx) are rational.

(b) Considering the logic and justification from point (a), provide at least two different cashback options that would allow banks to partially avoid the problems they face in the situation described in point (a).","output":"(a) Why offering cashback via loyalty programs might be unprofitable for banks 1. **High Financial Literacy Among Customers:** - Banks that create various loyalty programs, including cashback, often target the average consumer in a specific category of cardholders. - These programs are designed with the expectation that the average percentage of returned funds in the form of cashback will not be substantial. - However, financially literate customers often exploit these programs to maximize their benefits. These customers might possess multiple cashback cards for different expenditure categories (possibly even from different banks). - For example: - One card could be used exclusively for restaurant payments. - Another card might cover supermarket purchases. - A third card might be used for fuel at gas stations. - Customers then use each card to pay for the category of goods or services that provides the highest cashback. This strategy can significantly reduce the profitability of such programs for banks. 2. **Preferential Card Usage:** - Another unfavorable scenario for banks is when a customer uses a cashback card solely for specific categories where the cashback is highest. For other transactions, the customer prefers cash payments or uses another non-cashback card. - For instance, a customer might heavily use a card for a category like 'groceries' if the cashback is higher in that category but might avoid using the card for any other categories. Conclusion: - These strategies can cause banks to lose more money on cashback payments than they anticipated. As a result, banks might lose interest in offering cashback incentives to customers due to their reduced profitability. blacksquare (b) Two Different Ways to Calculate Cashback for Banks to Partially Avoid Issues Described in (a) 1. **Monthly Cashback Cap:** - **Implementation:** - A bank might declare a 10% cashback on purchases in a specific category, such as fuel. However, they also set a monthly cap on the cashback amount. - For instance, irrespective of how much a customer spends in a month, they can only receive up to 2000 rubles in cashback from fuel purchases. - **Benefit:** - This cap helps limit the bank's expenses on cashback payments and curbs potential misuse by those looking to maximize cashbacks strategically. 2. **Variable Cashback Percentage:** - **Implementation:** - Banks can offer variable cashback rates based on transaction activity. - Example: The bank might provide a lower cashback percentage in categories where frequent high cashback claims are made or stop offering cashback in specific categories if it appears that customers are using those purely as a source of income. - **Benefit:** - This method helps manage and mitigate excessive cashback payouts while adjusting to the customer usage patterns to preserve the profitability of the cashback program. 3. **Non-Monetary Cashback Rewards:** - **Implementation:** - Instead of offering cashback in money, banks reward customers with points, bonuses, or miles. - These points can later be redeemed for rewards rather than direct monetary benefits. - **Benefit:** - Points and non-cash rewards often come with restrictions and are less liquid than cash. The conversion of points or miles into cash equivalents can be at a lower value, thus helping banks save on direct cash outflows and maintaining customer engagement. Conclusion: - By employing these strategies, banks can scale down their payout expenses on cashback and manage the customer's exploitative strategies while still maintaining the attraction of cashback or loyalty programs. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find the flux of the vector field vec{a} = x vec{i} + y vec{j} + z vec{k} through the part of the surface x^2 + y^2 = 1 bounded by the planes ( z = 0 ) and ( z = 2 ).

We can identify it as a cylinder. To find the unit normal vector to this cylinder, we start with the function ( F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 ). The gradient of ( F ) (denoted as ( operatorname{grad} F )) is: [ operatorname{grad} F = leftlangle frac{partial F}{partial x}, frac{partial F}{partial y}, frac{partial F}{partial z} rightrangle = leftlangle 2x, 2y, 0 rightrangle ] The unit normal vector ( vec{n}_0 ) is then: [ vec{n}_0 = pm frac{operatorname{grad} F}{| operatorname{grad} F |} = pm frac{leftlangle 2x, 2y, 0 rightrangle}{sqrt{(2x)^2 + (2y)^2}} = pm frac{leftlangle x, y, 0 rightrangle}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = pm leftlangle x, y, 0 rightrangle ] Considering ( vec{n}_0 ) should point outward, we choose the positive sign. 2. **Calculate the Scalar Product:** The scalar product of the vector field ( vec{a} ) and the unit normal ( vec{n}_0 ) is: [ left( vec{a}, vec{n}_0 right) = leftlangle x, y, z rightrangle cdot leftlangle x, y, 0 rightrangle = x cdot x + y cdot y = x^2 + y^2 ] Since ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ) on the surface, this simplifies to: [ left( vec{a}, vec{n}_0 right) = 1 ] 3. **Set up the Surface Integral:** Using the formula for the flux ( Phi ) through a surface ( Sigma ), we have: [ Phi = iint_{Sigma} left( vec{a}, vec{n}_0 right) dsigma ] Substituting ( left( vec{a}, vec{n}_0 right) = 1 ): [ Phi = iint_{Sigma} 1 , dsigma = iint_{Sigma} dsigma ] 4. **Convert to Cylindrical Coordinates:** The surface element in cylindrical coordinates is ( dsigma = dvarphi , dz ), where ( x = cos varphi ) and ( y = sin varphi ).

The rare subsets that contain (4n-3) and (4n-4). 12. **Subcase 1:** - If a rare subset contains (4n-3) but not (4n-4), then the remaining elements must form a rare subset of the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 4n-5}). - The number of such subsets is ( g(n-1) ). 13. **Subcase 2:** - If a rare subset contains (4n-3) and (4n-4), then the remaining elements must form a rare subset of the set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 4n-5}). - The number of such subsets is ( f(n-1) ). 14. **Combining the cases:** - The total number of rare subsets that do not contain the elements (4n-1) or (4n-2) is given by: [ g(n) = g(n-1) + g(n-1) + f(n-1) = 2g(n-1) + f(n-1) ] 15. **Solving the recurrence relations:** - We have the following recurrence relations: [ f(n) = g(n) + 2f(n-1) ] [ g(n) = 2g(n-1) + f(n-1) ] 16. **Characteristic polynomial:** - The characteristic polynomial of the matrix (begin{pmatrix} 6 & 2 3 & 1 end{pmatrix}) is (x^2 - 7x). - Therefore, for (n > 1), we have (f(n) = 7f(n-1)). 17. **Initial condition:** - We have (f(1) = 8). 18. **General solution:** - The general solution to the recurrence relation is: [ f(n) = 8 cdot 7^{n-1} ] The final answer is ( boxed{ 8 cdot 7^{n-1} } )."},{"instruction":"Let the function f(x) = x + sin x.

Group two contains vertex (B) and vertices at distance (r) from (B) (not including (A)). 4. Let vertex (X) be any vertex in group one (other than (B)) and (Y) any vertex in group two (other than (A)). In triangle (AXY), since (AY) is not labeled (r) but (AX) is, it follows (XY) must be labeled (r). Thus, any edge between vertices in group one and group two is labeled (r). 5. If we pick any two vertices (X) and (Y) in group one, in triangle (AXY), since both (AX) and (AY) are labeled (r), (XY) must be labeled less than (r). The same reasoning applies to any two points in group two. # Largest possible (r): 1. To rigorously determine the largest (r), assume (r) cannot be larger than (n-1). 2. When (n=3), it's clear the maximum (r=2); thus, our claim holds for (n=3). 3. Perform mathematical induction to validate this for all (n geq 3). Assume the claim holds for all values less than (n). Now for an (n)-gon (P), divide vertices as described earlier into two groups where group one has (k) vertices, and group two has (n-k) vertices. Induction: 1. Due to our consistent assumption for smaller values, in the (k)-gon (P_1), the maximum value on edges is (k-1), similarly for ((n-k))-gon (P_2). 2. Given every label between vertices from different groups is (r), the maximum possible distinct labels used is ((k-1)+(n-k-1)+1=n-1). From the induction, we deduce that r_{max} = n-1. # Counting \\"very good labeling\\": 1. Define (f(n)) to be the count of valid \\"very good labelings\\" for an (n)-gon. 2. For base case (n=3, r=2), clearly we have (f(3)=C_{3}^{1}=3) as valid configurations. 3. Using mathematical induction, assuming (f(k) = frac{k!(k-1)!}{2^{k-1}}) for (k < n), and proving for (n): - For the (n)-gon, separate vertices into two non-empty groups with (k) vertices each: - Choosing (k) vertices has (C_{n}^{k}) ways. - Within group one, choose (k-1) from (1,2, cdots, n-2) giving (C_{n-2}^{k-1}). - The remaining (n-1-k) numbers label the second group’s edges. 4. We've double-counted every valid configuration, hence (f(n) = frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} C_{n}^{*} C_{n-2}^{k-1} f(k) f(n-k)). Calculations: begin{align*} f(n) &= frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} binom{n}{k} binom{n-2}{k-1} f(k) f(n-k) &= frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} cdot frac{(n-2)!}{(k-1)!(n-k-1)!} f(k) f(n-k) &= frac{n!(n-1)!}{2(n-1)} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{2^{k-1}} cdot frac{1}{2^{n-k-1}} &= frac{n!(n-1)!}{2^{n-1}}. end{align*} Thus, satisfying the relationship via induction.

According to the problem and the provided diagram, there are more black cells than white cells.

We know the lateral surface of the cone unfolds into a semicircle, implying the perimeter of this semicircle equals the circumference of the base of the cone. Therefore, pi l = 2pi r, leading to the equation: l = 2r. 2. The total surface area (S) of the cone includes its base area plus its lateral (or side) area. The formula for the total surface area of a cone is given by S = pi r^{2} + pi rl.

In how many ways can a plane be placed so that it intersects the dodecahedron in a regular hexagon?","output":"To determine the number of ways to slice a regular dodecahedron with a plane such that the resulting cross-section is a regular hexagon, we need to follow several steps and consider the properties of the dodecahedron carefully. Below is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding the Structure:** A regular dodecahedron has 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon. It also has 20 vertices and 30 edges. 2. **Diagonals in a Pentagonal Face:** Each pentagonal face of the dodecahedron has five vertices. From each vertex, there are two diagonals that can be drawn within that pentagon. So, each face has five diagonals. 3. **Large Diagonals in the Dodecahedron:** We are particularly interested in the \\"large diagonals\\" — those that span across several faces of the dodecahedron and not diagonals within a single face. For a regular dodecahedron, there are a total of 10 such large diagonals. 4. **Cross-Section Plane Analysis:** For each of these 10 large diagonals, a plane can be passed through them. For each large diagonal, there are three possible ways to orient a plane such that it intersects the dodecahedron in a regular hexagon: - Intruding perpendicularly at different angles or positions generating from that diagnoal. 5. **Summing the Possible Plane Configurations:** Since there are 10 large diagonals and each can have 3 distinct planes that will create a regular hexagon when intersecting the dodecahedron, we multiply: [ 10 text{ large diagonals} times 3 text{ possible planes per diagonal} = 30. ] 6. **Verification of Plane Properties:** We need to ensure that the plane cutting through the dodecahedron perpendicularly to a large diagonal indeed forms the required regular hexagon, this has been proven geometrically as: - The sections initially form regular triangles and upon moving, they evolve into irregular hexagons. - At specific positions (particularly when it passes through the center), these hexagons become regular due to spatial symmetry. 7. **Excluding Non-Perpendicular Plane Configurations:** Any plane not perpendicular to a large diagonal cannot form a regular hexagon because: - Parallel sides of the hexagon would lie on adjacent or non-adjacent faces not maintaining the geometric regularity needed. - Thus, only planes perpendicular to the 10 large diagonals generate regular hexagons. # Conclusion: After verifying and summing all possible distinct planes, we conclude: [ boxed{30} ]"},{"instruction":"f y gt x, then which of the following inequalities is correct?

After one hour (i.e., 3600 seconds), the number of cuts made is 3600. Each cut increases the number of pieces by one because a single sheet split into two pieces after one cut, and therefore, each subsequent cut splits one piece again, generating one additional new piece. We need to find the expected number of sides of the polygon he gets after one hour of such cutting. - Let (k) be the number of cuts made in one hour, ( k = 3600 ). - Initially, the rectangular sheet of paper has 4 sides. - After each cut, Vasya slices a polygon into two parts. Each cut effectively increases the total number of new edges formed in each polygon since new edges are formed along the cut. After (k) cuts, the number of sides increases and can be described as follows: - Initial number of sides ( = 4 ) - After ( k ) cuts, the total number of sides is ( 4+4k ): [ text{Total number of sides} = 4 + 4 times k = 4 + 4 times 3600 = 14404 ] There are a total of ( 3600 + 1 = 3601 ) polygons.

Given frac{S_5}{5} - frac{S_3}{3} = 2, we can find the common difference of the sequence left{ frac{S_n}{n} right}: frac{S_5}{5} - frac{S_3}{3} = 2 Rightarrow left(frac{d}{2} cdot 5 + left(2 - frac{d}{2}right)right) - left(frac{d}{2} cdot 3 + left(2 - frac{d}{2}right)right) = 2 Simplifying the above equation will give us the value of d: frac{5d}{2} + 2 - frac{d}{2} - left(frac{3d}{2} + 2 - frac{d}{2}right) = 2 d = 2 Using the value of d and a_1 = 2 in the general formula, we find the explicit formula for S_n: frac{S_n}{n} = 2 + frac{n-1}{2} cdot 2 = n+1 S_n = n(n+1) The reciprocal frac {1}{S_{n}} simplifies to a telescoping series: frac {1}{S_{n}}= frac {1}{n(n+1)}= frac {1}{n}- frac {1}{n+1} The sum of the first 10 terms of the sequence left{frac{1}{S_n}right} is then: T_{10} = left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) + left(frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3}right) + ldots + left(frac{1}{10} - frac{1}{11}right) Every term except the first and the last cancel out, leaving us with: T_{10} = 1 - frac{1}{11} = frac{10}{11} Therefore, the correct option is boxed{text{B. }frac{10}{11}}."},{"instruction":"The function g satisfies [ 2g(x) + 3g(2x + y) + 3xy = g(3x y) + 3x^2 + 3 ] for all real numbers x, y.

Brenda runs 120 meters to the first meeting point, implying Sally runs x/2 - 120 meters to this point. 3. **Analyze Second Meeting:** After the first meeting, they continue and meet again after Brenda runs an additional 200 meters. Total distance Brenda runs from the starting point at the second meeting is 120 + 200 = 320 meters. During this time, Sally must run the rest of the track from her position and meet Brenda, which amounts to x - (x/2 - 120) = x/2 + 120 meters, plus complete another half-lap: x/2 + 120 + x/2 = x + 120. 4. **Total Distance Run by Sally:** Since the sum of distances covered by Sally at the second meeting must equal the total distance Brenda ran, we set: [ x + 120 = 320 ] Simplifying, we find: [ x = 320 - 120 = 200 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, the total length of the track is 200 meters.

Let's introduce points and angles as follows: - Let ( D ) be the midpoint of ( BC ). - Let ( E ) be the foot of the perpendicular from ( C ) to ( AD ). - Given is ( angle ACE = angle ABC ). 2. **Introducing Point ( F ):** Introduce point ( F ) as the intersection of ( AD ) with the line perpendicular to ( AC ) through ( C ). 3. **Analyzing Angle Relationships:** By the problem's condition, we have: [ angle AFC = 90^circ - angle FAC = angle ACE = angle ABC ] 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** This implies that points ( A, B, F, C ) lie on a circle because ( angle AFC + angle ABC = 180^circ ). Thus, ( A, B, F, C ) form a cyclic quadrilateral. 5. **Thales's Theorem and Circle Properties:** According to Thales's theorem (since ( A, B, F, C ) lie on a circle with ( AF ) as the diameter), we have two possibilities: - The line ( AD ) (which is the perpendicular bisector of ( BC )) also bisects the chord ( BC ) either perpendicularly or it passes through the center of the circumcircle of the quadrilateral ( ABFC ). 6. **Case 1: ( AF perp BC ):** If the diameter ( AF ) is perpendicular to ( BC ), then the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ) and the altitude from ( A ) to ( BC ) are coincident.

Rajzoljunk a C-n és D-n át olyan c, d, egymással párhuzamos egyeneseket, hogy az A és d közti távolság egyenlő legyen a B és c közti távolsággal. 1. **First Case:** - When the distance from point A to line d is equal in magnitude and direction to the distance from point B to line c. Here, direction means that the displacement from A to d and from B to c are in the same direction (see Figure 1). 2. **Determining the Projection Points:** - Let A_{1} and B_{1} be the projections of points A and B onto lines d and c respectively. Since A A_{1} parallel B B_{1}, the quadrilateral A B B_{1} A_{1} is a parallelogram. 3. **Translating the Points:** - Translate point A to point D. If we apply the same translation to point B, the obtained point (denoted as C^{prime}) will lie on line c. This follows since A D parallel B C^{prime}, making quadrilateral A B C^{prime} D a parallelogram. Consequently, A B parallel A_{1} B_{1} and A B parallel D C^{prime} imply that quadrilateral A_{1} B_{1} C^{prime} D is also a parallelogram, hence A_{1} D parallel B_{1} C^{prime}. 4. **Constructing the Lines:** - The points C^{prime} and the original C determine line c. Drawing a line parallel to c through D gives us line d. Thus, the lines c and d indeed satisfy the given condition: - c parallel d - A D = B C^{prime} and the angles angle A D A_{1} = angle B C^{prime} B_{1} = 90^circ, thus triangles triangle A A_{1} D and triangle B B_{1} C^{prime} are congruent, confirming A A_{1} = B B_{1}. 2. **Second Case:** - Consider the scenario where the distance from point A to d and the distance from point B to c are equal but in opposite directions. 5. **Intersection Points:** - Let line A B intersect line c at point C_{1} and line d at point D_{1}. The midpoint of segment A B is F_{1}, which is also the midpoint of segment C_{1} D_{1}. This follows since A D_{1} = B C_{1}. 6. **Midpoints and Parallel Lines:** - Point F_{1} lies on the line k, which is the perpendicular bisector of the distance between lines c and d. Similarly, the midpoint F_{2} of distance C D also lies on line k. These two midpoints define line k. Thus, lines c and d, parallel to k and passing through points C and D respectively, fulfill the given conditions similarly to the first case. # Conclusion: - For a given set of points A, B, C, D, there generally exist two pairs of parallel lines c and d that satisfy the problem's conditions, corresponding to the two different arrangements analyzed (see Figures 1, 2, and 3).

A hyperbol","output":"Given the two circles: 1. x^2 + y^2 = 1, which has center O_1(0,0) and radius r_1 = 1. 2. x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 12 = 0, which is equivalent to (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 4, hence has center O_2(4, 0) and radius r_2 = 2. If a moving circle is externally tangent to both of these circles, its center C(h, k) must be located such that the distance from C to O_1 minus the radius of the first circle is equal to the distance from C to O_2 minus the radius of the second circle. That's because the distance from C to each fixed circle's center minus the fixed circle's radius would be equal to the moving circle's radius. Thus, the locus of C is determined by the following equation: sqrt{h^2 + k^2} - 1 = sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} - 2 Moving the constants to the other side and squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots gives: (sqrt{h^2 + k^2} + 1)^2 = (sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} + 2)^2 Expand and simplify: h^2 + k^2 + 2sqrt{h^2 + k^2} + 1 = h^2 - 8h + 16 + k^2 + 4sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} + 4 Now, let's isolate the radical expressions on one side: 2sqrt{h^2 + k^2} - 4sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} = 8h - 19 Square both sides again to eliminate the radicals: (2sqrt{h^2 + k^2} - 4sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2})^2 = (8h - 19)^2 Expand both sides and simplify: 4(h^2 + k^2) + 16((h-4)^2 + k^2) - 16sqrt{h^2 + k^2}sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} = 64h^2 - 304h + 361 Then simplify further to isolate the square root term: -16sqrt{h^2 + k^2}sqrt{(h-4)^2 + k^2} = 64h^2 - 304h + 361 - 4(h^2 + k^2) - 16((h-4)^2 + k^2) Substitute back the expressions for the radii of the circles and simplify: -16(r_1^2)(r_2^2) = 64h^2 - 304h + 361 - 4r_1^2 - 16r_2^2 Given r_1 = 1 and r_2 = 2, the equation becomes: -64 = 64h^2 - 304h + 361 - 4 - 64 Further simplification yields: 64h^2 - 304h + 301 = 0 This is a quadratic equation in terms of h. Solving for h gives the x-coordinates of the center of the moving circle. This equation has the structure of a hyperbola translated along the x-axis. Divide the entire equation by 64 to get it in a standard form: h^2 - frac{304}{64}h + frac{301}{64} = 0 The equation simplies to a standard form of a hyperbola shifted from the origin since there's no k^2 term: h^2 - frac{38}{8}h + frac{301}{64} = 0 The final answer indicates that the path of the center C(h, k) of the moving circle takes the shape of a hyperbola.

The weight of the Monday-Saturday papers is 8 ounces each, so for 250 papers, the total weight per day is 250 * 8 = 2000 ounces. Since there are 60 Monday-Saturday days, the total weight for these days is 60 * 2000 = 120,000 ounces. The Sunday paper weighs twice as much as the Monday-Saturday paper, so each Sunday paper weighs 8 * 2 = 16 ounces. For 250 Sunday papers, the total weight per Sunday is 250 * 16 = 4000 ounces. Since there are 10 Sundays, the total weight for Sundays is 10 * 4000 = 40,000 ounces.

There are 25 different numbers in the range of 0 to 24, but since 0 friends mean the student has no friends in the class and 24 friends mean the student is friends with everyone else in the class (which means the student can't count themselves in the friend list, thus the range should be 1 to 24), let's denote those numbers: [ {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{25}} = {0, 1, 2, 3, ldots, 24} ] 3. Now, we need to determine how many friends Petya has. Since Petya is also among the 25 students and every student has a unique number of friends within the range of 0 to 24, the total sum of the degrees of all vertexes in a graph (since each student can be treated as a vertex, and friendship as an edge) must be even because it counts each edge twice.

Petya, being one of the students, must have one of these numbers of friends. Given the unique assignment of numbers, and all other 24 students have their friend count from 0 to 23, Petya must have the remaining count which balances all other constraints: Since (0 , textrm{to} , 24) needs to be covered and each number is unique, the friend count of Petya lies in the mid-range because each surrounding friend count appropriately accounts for all other classmates with distinct counts implying Petya stands central in this range.

When b_n > 2, consider the transformation: [ b_{n+1} - 2 = 2 - frac{1}{b_n} + frac{1}{2 b_n^2} - 2 = -frac{1}{b_n} + frac{1}{2 b_n^2} ] 4. We need to show it increases for b_n > 2: [ b_{n+1} - 2 = frac{b_n^2}{2} - b_n = frac{b_n(b_n - 2)}{2} > 0 quad text{for} ; b_n > 2 ] By mathematical induction, if b_n > 2, then b_{n+1} > 2 for all n in mathbb{N}^*. Hence, {b_n} is strictly increasing. 5. We also have: [ b_{n+1} - b_n = frac{b_n^2}{2} - 2b_n + 2 = frac{1}{2} (b_n - 2)^2 > 0 ] This implies that the sequence {b_n} is monotonically increasing. 6. From b_{n+1} - 2 > frac{3}{2} (b_n - 2), we can show: [ b_n - 2 geq (b_1 - 2) left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} = left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} ] Thus: [ b_n geq 2 + left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} ] As n to +infty, b_n to +infty. 7. To find the sum, we use: [ frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 2} = frac{2}{b_n(b_n - 2)} = frac{1}{b_n - 2} - frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 2} ] Giving: [ frac{1}{b_n} = frac{1}{b_n - 2} - frac{1}{b_{n+1} - 2} ] 8. Summing up from k=1 to m: [ sum_{k=1}^m a_k = sum_{k=1}^m frac{1}{b_k} = frac{1}{b_1 - 2} - frac{1}{b_{m+1} - 2} ] Since b_1 = 3, we have: [ frac{1}{b_1 - 2} = 1 ] Thus: [ sum_{k=1}^m a_k = 1 - frac{1}{b_{m+1} - 2} ] 9. As n to +infty, b_n to +infty, hence: [ frac{1}{b_{m+1} - 2} to 0 ] 10.

This implies that these lines pass through the incenter of the triangle (the point where the angle bisectors meet). 2. **Diameter Analysis:** Denote the second intersection points of AN and BM with the inscribed circle as P' and Q', respectively. Therefore, PP' and QQ' are diameters of the inscribed circle because these are the lines passing through the center of the circle (incenter). 3. **Rectangular Property:** Consequently, quadrilateral PQP'Q' must be a rectangle, as the diameters intersect at right angles. Notably, this means that P'Q' = PQ. 4. **Relative Positioning:** Observing the positioning: - Points M and N, by construction, lie outside triangle ABC. - Points P' and Q' lie inside the triangle. Therefore, points M and N lie on the rays IP' and IQ', respectively, extending further out compared to points P and Q. 5. **Final Comparison:** Since MN extends beyond P'Q', we have MN > P'Q' = PQ.

According to the given information, the cost price of 20 articles is equal to the selling price of 16 articles. Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20C = 16S Now, we want to find the ratio of the selling price to the cost price to determine the profit or loss percentage. We can rearrange the equation to solve for S in terms of C: S = (20C / 16) Simplify the fraction: S = (5C / 4) Now we can see that the selling price is 5/4 times the cost price. This means that for every 4 units of cost, the selling price is 5 units. The profit per article is the selling price minus the cost price: Profit per article = S - C Profit per article = (5C / 4) - C To find the profit in terms of C, we need to have a common denominator: Profit per article = (5C - 4C) / 4 Profit per article = C / 4 The profit per article is 1/4 of the cost price of one article. To find the profit percentage, we divide the profit per article by the cost price and multiply by 100: Profit percentage = (Profit per article / C) * 100 Profit percentage = (C / 4) / C * 100 Profit percentage = (1 / 4) * 100 Profit percentage = 25% Therefore, the merchant makes a profit of boxed{25%} ."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x^3 3ax 1, where a neq 0.

The center cell is shared by both diagonals in the X-shaped diagram. 2. **Observation on Diagonal Sums**: Regardless of Bea’s moves, the total sum of the numbers in the diagonals will always be 20 once the game is over. This can be calculated as follows: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ] Including the 5 that is in the center (counted twice): [ 15 + 5 = 20 ] 3. **Bea's Move**: Bea will place a number ( n ) in one of the corner cells, where ( n in {1, 2, 3, 4} ). 4. **Ara's Response**: Ara can then place ( 5 - n ) in the opposite corner of where Bea placed ( n ). This ensures that one diagonal adds up to: [ 5 + n + (5 - n) = 10 ] Noting that ( 5 - n ) is still one of the numbers 1 through 4, and thus he is not using the same number again. 5. **Remaining Moves**: The rest of the moves will proceed naturally without interfering with the above-formed diagonal. The total sum of both diagonals being 20, and one diagonal guaranteed to be 10, makes the other diagonal: [ 20 - 10 = 10 ] Thus, both diagonals will have a sum of 10. 6. **Conclusion**: Ara will win by ensuring both diagonals sum to the same value.

The number of employees with pagers (PE) would include those who have both a pager and a cell phone (0.4E) and those who have only a pager. The number of employees with only a pager would be PE - 0.4E. Since the number of employees with either a cell phone or a pager or both is (2/3)E, we can write the following equation: (2/3)E = (2/3)E (number of employees with cell phones) + (PE - 0.4E) (number of employees with only a pager) However, this equation includes the number of employees with both a cell phone and a pager twice, once in the cell phone group and once in the pager group. To correct for this, we subtract the number of employees with both (0.4E) from the total: (2/3)E = (2/3)E + PE - 0.4E - 0.4E Simplifying, we get: (2/3)E = (2/3)E + PE - 0.8E Since (2/3)E is on both sides of the equation, we can cancel it out: 0 = PE - 0.8E Adding 0.8E to both sides gives us: 0.8E = PE This means that the fraction of employees with pagers (P) is boxed{0.8,} or 80%."},{"instruction":"Nick has a collection of 50 coins, including quarters, dimes, and nickels. 3/10 of his collection are quarters, 40% are dimes, and the rest are nickels.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, there are a total of 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. If Racing Magic takes 150 seconds to circle the track once, then in one hour (3600 seconds), it can complete 3600 / 150 = 24 rounds. Now we know: - Charging Bull makes 40 rounds in an hour. - Racing Magic makes 24 rounds in an hour. To find out when they will meet at the starting point for the second time, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of rounds they can complete in an hour. The LCM will give us the number of rounds after which they will both be at the starting point together. The LCM of 24 and 40 is 120 (since 120 is the smallest number that both 24 and 40 can divide into without leaving a remainder). This means they will meet at the starting point after Racing Magic has completed 120 rounds and Charging Bull has also completed 120 rounds. Since Racing Magic completes 24 rounds in an hour, it will take Racing Magic 120 / 24 = 5 hours to complete 120 rounds. Since we are looking for the time in minutes, we convert 5 hours into minutes: 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes.

From the given series, we know sin x > x - frac{x^3}{3!} because all the negative terms of the series decrease the value of sin x, and the first negative term is -frac{x^3}{3!}. 2. Dividing both sides by x, we get frac{sin x}{x} > 1 - frac{x^2}{6}. 3. Since x in (0, frac{pi}{2}), we substitute the upper bound of x to get a lower bound for the expression: 1 - frac{x^2}{6} > 1 - frac{(frac{pi}{2})^2}{6} = 1 - frac{pi^2}{24}. 4. We know that frac{pi^2}{24} < frac{1}{2}, hence 1 - frac{pi^2}{24} > frac{1}{2}. 5. Combining these inequalities, we have frac{sin x}{x} > 1 - frac{x^2}{6} > 1 - frac{pi^2}{24} > frac{1}{2}.

If a, b geq 0, the contradiction arises because f(x) leq 0 for x in [0, pi), which does not match the range [a, b] subseteq [0, pi). Hence, no harmonic interval exists in this case. 3. Similarly, if a, b leq 0, no harmonic interval exists due to a similar contradiction. 4. Considering a leq 0 leq b, if b geq frac{pi}{2}, then [0, frac{pi}{2}] subseteq [a, b]. The minimum value of f(x) is -2, leading to a = -2. Similarly, the maximum value of f(x) is 2, leading to b = 2. Thus, [-2, 2] is a harmonic interval. 5. If b < frac{pi}{2} and a leq -frac{pi}{2}, we again find a = -2 and b = 2, which is not consistent with b < frac{pi}{2}. 6. For a > -frac{pi}{2}, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in [a, b]. This leads to a system of equations a = -2sin b and b = -2sin a, which implies a + b = -2(sin a + sin b). 7. If b > -a, implying a + b > 0, then sin b > sin(-a), leading to sin b + sin a > 0, which contradicts a + b = -2(sin a + sin b). 8. If b < -a, a similar contradiction arises. 9.

Let's denote the circumcircles of triangles ( AA_1A_2 ), ( BB_1B_2 ), and ( CC_1C_2 ) as ( Gamma_A ), ( Gamma_B ), and ( Gamma_C ), respectively. 1. **Inversion with Center ( A )**: Consider an inversion with center ( A ) and an arbitrary radius. For simplicity, let's denote the inverse of a point ( X ) as ( X' ). Under this inversion: - ( A_1 ) is the inverse of ( C ). - ( A_2 ) is the inverse of ( C_2 ). - ( Gamma_A ) is the image of line ( C_1A_2 ) after inversion. Let's call this image line ( l_A ). 2. **Inversion with Centers ( B ) and ( C )**: Similarly, we can define the inverses of points and lines with respect to centers ( B ) and ( C ). 3. **Collinearity and Concurrency**: Since ( angle BA_1C + angle CB_1A + angle AC_1B = 480^circ ), and the sum of the angles in an equilateral triangle is ( 180^circ times (3 - 2) = 60^circ ), we have: [ angle BA_1C + angle CB_1A + angle AC_1B = angle CAB + angle ABC + angle BCA = 180^circ. ] Therefore, ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) are collinear points. Hence, under the inversion, ( C_1 ) is the inverse of line ( l ). Similarly, ( A_1 ) is the inverse of line ( l_C ), and ( B_1 ) is the inverse of line ( l_B ). We know that the inverses of three collinear points are concurrent. Therefore, ( l_A, l_B ), and ( l_C ) are concurrent at a point ( P ). 4. **Perpendicularity and Cyclicity**: Now, let's prove that ( Gamma_A, Gamma_B ), and ( Gamma_C ) pass through ( P ). Since ( l_A ) is the image of line ( C_1A_2 ) under inversion with center ( A ), we have ( C_1A_2 perp l_A ) (i.e., ( l_A ) is perpendicular to ( C_1A_2 ) at the intersection point ( P )). Similarly, ( A_1B_2 perp l_B ) and ( B_1C_2 perp l_C ). 5. **Angle Considerations**: Now, let's consider ( Gamma_A ) and prove that it passes through ( P ). Since ( C_1A_2 perp l_A ), and ( P ) is the intersection of ( C_1A_2 ) and ( l_A ), we have ( angle A_2PP' = 90^circ ). Therefore, ( A_2P'P ) is a straight line, where ( P' ) is the inverse of ( P ). But we also know that ( A_1A_2P'C_1 ) is cyclic (since ( Gamma_A ) is the circumcircle of triangle ( AA_1A_2 )). So, ( angle A_2P'A_1 = 180^circ - angle C_1A_1P' = 180^circ - angle C_1AA_1 ). 6. **Angle Relations**: Now, ( angle C_1A_1A = angle C_1BA = angle BCA ) (since ( C_1A = AC, C_1B = BC )). Therefore, ( angle C_1A_1P' = 180^circ - angle BCA ). Thus, ( angle A_2P'A_1 = angle BCA ). Since ( angle A_2PP' = 90^circ ), it implies that ( angle A_2PA_1 = 90^circ + angle BCA ). Similarly, we can prove that ( angle B_2PB_1 = 90^circ + angle CAB ) and ( angle C_2PC_1 = 90^circ + angle ABC ). 7. **Concyclic Points**: Now, consider the angles of triangle ( PAB ): [ angle APB = 360^circ - (angle A_2PA_1 + angle B_2PB_1) = 360^circ - [(90^circ + angle BCA) + (90^circ + angle CAB)] = 180^circ - angle ABC. ] Similarly, ( angle APC = 180^circ - angle BCA ) and ( angle BPC = 180^circ - angle CAB ). These angle relations show that points ( P, A, B, C ) are concyclic. Thus, ( Gamma_A, Gamma_B ), and ( Gamma_C ) all pass through ( P ). Hence, we have shown that ( l_A, l_B ), and ( l_C ) are concurrent at ( P ), and ( Gamma_A, Gamma_B ), and ( Gamma_C ) all pass through ( P ). Thus, the three circumcircles are coaxial, and they share the two common points ( P ) and the center of the equilateral triangle ( ABC ). This completes the proof.

The distance covered by Train A when they meet is 75 miles, which it covers in the same time that Train B covers the remaining distance of the route. Since Train A completes the trip in 10 hours, its speed is the total distance of the route divided by 10 hours. Similarly, since Train B completes the trip in 6 hours, its speed is the total distance of the route divided by 6 hours. Let's denote the total distance of the route as ( D ). Then we have: [ v_A = frac{D}{10} ] [ v_B = frac{D}{6} ] When the two trains meet, they have covered the entire distance ( D ) together. So, the distance covered by Train A plus the distance covered by Train B equals ( D ). We know Train A has covered 75 miles, so Train B has covered ( D - 75 ) miles. Since they started at the same time and met at the same time, the time ( t ) they traveled before meeting is the same for both. So we can write: [ v_A cdot t = 75 ] [ v_B cdot t = D - 75 ] Substituting the expressions for ( v_A ) and ( v_B ) into these equations, we get: [ frac{D}{10} cdot t = 75 ] [ frac{D}{6} cdot t = D - 75 ] From the first equation, we can solve for ( t ): [ t = frac{75 cdot 10}{D} ] Substituting this into the second equation, we get: [ frac{D}{6} cdot frac{75 cdot 10}{D} = D - 75 ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{750}{6} = D - 75 ] [ 125 = D - 75 ] [ D = 125 + 75 ] [ D = 200 ] So, the length of the route is boxed{200} miles."},{"instruction":"Next food item she has to prepare is soup.

This would imply the graphs of ( P(x) + ax^k ) and ( Q(x) + bx^l ) do not intersect. **Step 3**: For ( R(x) ) to have no roots, we consider its degree: * If ( n = 0 ), ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are constants.

Hence, we need to ensure ( a_i ) and ( a_{i+1} ) are such that ( a_i + a_{i+1} ) is even. - If ( a_i ) and ( a_{i+1} ) are both odd or both even, ( frac{a_i + a_{i+1}}{2} ) is an integer. 6. **Ensuring Same Color**: - If ( a_i ) and ( a_{i+1} ) are both red and both odd or both even, then ( frac{a_i + a_{i+1}}{2} ) is an integer. - If ( frac{a_i + a_{i+1}}{2} ) is red, we continue. If not, we need to adjust our sequence. 7. **Adjusting Sequence**: - If ( frac{a_i + a_{i+1}}{2} ) is not red, we can find another pair ( a_i, a_{i+1} ) such that ( frac{a_i + a_{i+1}}{2} ) is red. - Since there are infinitely many red integers, we can always find such pairs. 8. **Conclusion for Red**: - By repeating this process, we can construct an infinite sequence where all terms ( a_1, frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}, a_2, frac{a_2 + a_3}{2}, ldots ) are red. 9. **Case 2: Infinitely many blue integers**: - The same argument applies as in Case 1, but with blue integers instead of red. 10. **Final Conclusion**: - Therefore, there exists an infinite sequence of positive integers ( a_{1} < a_{2} < a_{3} < cdots < a_{n} < cdots ) such that the sequence ( a_{1}, frac{a_{1} + a_{2}}{2}, a_{2}, frac{a_{2} + a_{3}}{2}, a_{3}, frac{a_{3} + a_{4}}{2}, cdots ) has the same color.

Preliminary Calculations: - In the sequence from 1 to 140: - Numbers that are multiples of 4: leftlfloor frac{140}{4} rightrfloor = 35 - Numbers that are multiples of 7: leftlfloor frac{140}{7} rightrfloor = 20 - Numbers that are multiples of both 4 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 28): leftlfloor frac{140}{28} rightrfloor = 5 - Numbers that are multiples of 5: leftlfloor frac{140}{5} rightrfloor = 28 So, we have (35 + 20 - 5) = 50 total removed from 140, leaving 140 - 50 = 90, adjusted for multiples of 5 that are kept: * Multiples of 5 kept: If they are also multiples of 4 or 7, add back in those subtracted previously. * Let’s calculate more specifically dividing into a and c classes (as per problem): - Remove 4’s multiples, except those multiples of 5 which we re-keep - Multiples of 7 and multiples of ( (4, 7) ) intersecting * Unique classes (a, b, c) as: - Multiples covered or defined by: unique characterization, fixed positions Final Calculation: 1.

Given multiples calculated in range to 20 sets: Rearrange and cross total remaining sequences: - Repeatable multiplicative calculations subtotal result cross-range (2800 x 20 - consistent with separate calculations: remnant remaining non covered) - Accounting remnant interval calculation: Thus, solution remains consistent within small error margin on repeatable sets: Conclusion: Based on such accounted regularity, we compute 1995: (final within full single sequence coverage re-calculation verify 2795 verifying) boxed{2795}"},{"instruction":"We call any eight squares in a diagonal of a chessboard as a fence.

Then what is the maximum number of times which the rook jumped over the fence?","output":"1. **Define the Fence and Constraints:** - The fence consists of the squares ( a1, b2, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8 ). - The rook cannot stand on any of these squares. - The rook can jump over these squares multiple times, but it cannot land on them. 2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Jumps Over Each Square:** - The rook can jump over ( a1 ) zero times because it starts from a different square. - For ( b2 ), the rook can jump over it at most 4 times (once for each row it can move horizontally across). - For ( c3 ), the rook can jump over it at most 8 times (4 horizontal and 4 vertical moves). - For ( d4 ), the rook can jump over it at most 12 times (4 horizontal and 8 vertical moves). - Similarly, for ( e5 ), ( f6 ), ( g7 ), and ( h8 ), the maximum jumps are 12, 8, 4, and 0 respectively. 3. **Sum the Maximum Jumps:** [ 0 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 12 + 8 + 4 + 0 = 48 ] - This sum represents the theoretical maximum number of jumps over the fence squares. 4. **Consider the Chessboard Partition:** - Divide the chessboard into four ( 4 times 4 ) squares: - Square \\"x\\" (a-d, 1-4) - Square \\"y\\" (a-d, 5-8) - Square \\"z\\" (e-h, 1-4) - Square \\"w\\" (e-h, 5-8) 5. **Analyze the Movement Constraints:** - To achieve 48 jumps, the rook must start from square \\"y\\", jump to square \\"x\\" or \\"w\\", return to square \\"y\\", and so on. - However, this movement pattern prevents the rook from reaching square \\"z\\". 6. **Conclusion on Maximum Jumps:** - Since the rook cannot reach square \\"z\\" while achieving 48 jumps, the maximum number of jumps must be less than 48. - Constructing an example with 47 jumps is feasible, indicating that 47 is the maximum number of jumps the rook can make over the fence.

Amount spent on travel: Rs 800 - Rs 600 = Rs 200 To find the fraction of the remaining money (after clothes and food) that was spent on travel, we divide the amount spent on travel by the amount remaining after clothes and food: Fraction spent on travel = Amount spent on travel / Remaining after food Fraction spent on travel = Rs 200 / Rs 800 Fraction spent on travel = 1/4 So, the person spent boxed{1/4} of the remaining money on travel."},{"instruction":"Given that a < 0, simplify the following expression: sqrt{a^2} .","output":"To simplify the expression sqrt{a^2} , we need to consider the definition of both the square and the square root functions. Step 1: Understand the square function. For any real number x, the square of x is defined as x^2, which yields a non-negative result. That is, x^2 geq 0 for all real numbers x. Step 2: Recognizing the principal square root. The square root function, denoted as sqrt{phantom{x}} , gives the principal (non-negative) square root of a non-negative number. If x geq 0, then sqrt{x^2} = x because we are looking for a non-negative number whose square is x^2. Step 3: Applying the definitions to the given problem. In the case of a < 0, the number a is negative. But the expression a^2 gives a positive result because the square of any real number is non-negative. Since we are taking the square root of a non-negative number (a^2), the principal square root should also be non-negative. Step 4: Addressing the negative value of a. Because a is negative, to keep the square root non-negative, the result should be the positive version of a. Therefore, sqrt{a^2} for a < 0 is not a, but rather -a, because -a is non-negative when a < 0. Thus, the simplified form of the expression sqrt{a^2} , when a < 0, is -a .

To find the overall probability that both pens are non-defective, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event: Probability(1st pen is non-defective) * Probability(2nd pen is non-defective | 1st pen is non-defective) = (5/8) * (4/7) Now, let's calculate it: (5/8) * (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14 So the probability that neither of the two pens selected will be defective is boxed{5/14} ."},{"instruction":"Given a function ( f: mathbb{Z}_{+} rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{+} ) such that for any ( x in mathbb{Z}_{+} ), it holds that [ f(x)+f(x+2) leq 2 f(x+1). ] Prove that there exists an infinite set of positive integers ( M ) such that for any ( i, j, k in M ), the following holds: [ (ij) f(k) + (jk) f(i) + (ki) f(j) = 0. ]","output":"1. Let's consider the sequence of points (A_n = (n, f(n))) where (n in mathbb{Z}_{+}). 2. Note that the given condition [ f(x) + f(x+2) leq 2 f(x+1) ] is equivalent to: [ f(x+1) - f(x) geq f(x+2) - f(x+1). ] 3. This implies that the differences between consecutive function values (f(n+1) - f(n)) are non-increasing. We can express this formally as: [ k_{A_n A_{n+1}} = f(n+1) - f(n) geq f(n+2) - f(n+1) = k_{A_{n+1} A_{n+2}}. ] 4. Hence, the sequence ({k_{A_n A_{n+1}}}) of slopes of the line segments joining consecutive points ((n, f(n))) is a non-increasing sequence of integers. Additionally, since the slopes are differences of function values that map (mathbb{Z}_{+}) to (mathbb{Z}_{+}), they are non-negative. 5. Suppose for contradiction that the sequence of slopes ({k_{A_n A_{n+1}}}) includes a negative term. Once a negative slope appears, all subsequent slopes must remain negative due to the non-increasing property, which contradicts the requirement that the function values are positive integers. 6. Therefore, ({k_{A_n A_{n+1}}}) is a non-increasing sequence of non-negative integers. Consequently, there must exist some (n_0) such that for all (n geq n_0), the slopes (k_{A_n A_{n+1}}) are constant. 7. This means that for (n geq n_0), the points (A_n) lie on a straight line with slope (u) and intercept (v). Hence, for (n geq n_0), we can write: [ f(n) = un + v, ] where (u in mathbb{Z}_{+}) and (v in mathbb{Z}). 8. Let (M = mathbb{Z} cap [n_0, +infty)). For any (i, j, k in M), the points ((i, f(i))), ((j, f(j))), and ((k, f(k))) lie on the same line. Therefore, we have: [ f(i) = ui + v, quad f(j) = uj + v, quad f(k) = uk + v. ] 9. Now consider the expression: [ (i-j) f(k) + (j-k) f(i) + (k-i) f(j). ] 10. Substituting the expressions for (f(i)), (f(j)), and (f(k)), we get: [ (i-j)(uk + v) + (j-k)(ui + v) + (k-i)(uj + v). ] 11. Expanding and regrouping terms, we have: [ begin{align*} (i-j)(uk + v) &+ (j-k)(ui + v) + (k-i)(uj + v) &= (i-j)uk + (i-j)v + (j-k)ui + (j-k)v + (k-i)uj + (k-i)v &= uki - ukj + vi - vj + uij - uik + uji - ujk + vjk - vij + uji - uij &= 0. end{align*} ] Conclusion: [ (i-j) f(k) + (j-k) f(i) + (k-i) f(j) = 0. ] Hence, there exists an infinite set of positive integers ( M ) such that for any ( i, j, k in M ), the relation ((i-j) f(k) + (j-k) f(i) + (k-i) f(j) = 0 ) holds.

Prove that one of them made a mistake.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each participant either receives squares or circles based on the nature of their relationships. The distribution is as follows: - Boys receive 3 circles and 8 squares. - Girls receive 9 circles and -2 squares. 2. **Total Figures Each Participant Receives**: - Boys receive (3 + 8 = 11) figures. - Girls receive (9 - 2 = 7) figures. 3. **Total Number of Figures**: According to the problem, the total number of figures given is 4046. 4. **Setting Up the Equation**: Let ( b ) denote the number of boys and ( g ) denote the number of girls in the camp. The total figures received can be expressed as: [ 11b + 7g = 4046 ] 5. **Analyzing the Equation Modulo 11**: To find an error, we can analyze the equation under modulo 11: [ 11b + 7g equiv 4046 pmod{11} ] 6. **Calculating ( 4046 pmod{11} )**: Using modulo operation: [ 4046 div 11 = 367 text{ remainder } 9 quad (text{since } 4046 - 11 times 367 = 9) ] Therefore, [ 4046 equiv 9 pmod{11} ] 7. **Simplifying the Equation**: Since ( 11b equiv 0 pmod{11} ): [ 0 + 7g equiv 9 pmod{11} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 7g equiv 9 pmod{11} ] 8. **Solving for ( g )**: To solve for ( g ), find the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 11.

For any single move, either 3 black and 1 white squares, or 1 black and 3 white squares are involved. Therefore, each move alters the parity (even/odd nature) of the count difference between black and white squares by pm4. This implies: [ Delta_{text{black-white count (mod 4)}} text{ remains constant}. ] Start with an n times n chessboard where ( n ) is odd. Assume all corners are black, then the initial difference (black - white) bmod 4 = 1. If every square must be changed to its opposite color, then the final difference bmod 4 should be 3. This is a contradiction as the difference bmod 4 remains constant. Therefore, the desired transformation is impossible when ( n ) is an odd number. 2. **Case n = 4k**: Divide the 4k times 4k chessboard into k^2 small 4 times 4 squares. Each 4 times 4 square can be divided into 4 smaller 2 times 2 squares and we can independently perform one move on each ( 2 times 2 ) square within the ( 4 times 4 ) square to achieve the desired transformation: This operation is shown in the corresponding figure (assumed available in the problem). Therefore, each small (4 times 4) square achieves the required color change, thus the entire 4k times 4k chessboard can be transformed completely. 3. **Case n = 4k + 2**: First, focus on the largest 4k times 4k sub-square within the n times n chessboard. Transform all squares in this sub-square using the method previously described for 4k times 4k boards. Next, consider the remaining part, which will consist of 2 times n and n times 2 strips bordering the 4k times 4k part.

Now we use the tangent addition formula for the given condition alpha + beta = frac{pi}{4}: [ tan(alpha + beta) = 1 quad text{(since } tanleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = 1text{)} ] 8. Using the tangent addition formula: [ tan(alpha + beta) = frac{tan alpha + tan beta}{1 - tan alpha cdot tan beta} ] 9. Substituting tan beta = 2 tan alpha into the tangent addition formula, we get: [ frac{tan alpha + 2 tan alpha}{1 - tan alpha cdot 2 tan alpha} = 1 ] 10. Simplify the equation: [ frac{3 tan alpha}{1 - 2 tan^2 alpha} = 1 ] 11. Solve this equation: [ 3 tan alpha = 1 - 2 tan^2 alpha ] 12. Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation: [ 2 tan^2 alpha + 3 tan alpha - 1 = 0 ] 13. Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula where a = 2, b = 3, and c = -1: [ tan alpha = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = frac{-3 pm sqrt{3^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot (-1)}}{4} = frac{-3 pm sqrt{9 + 8}}{4} = frac{-3 pm sqrt{17}}{4} ] 14. Since alpha is an acute angle, we select the positive root: [ tan alpha = frac{sqrt{17} - 3}{4} ] 15. Therefore: [ alpha = arctan left(frac{sqrt{17} - 3}{4}right) ] 16. Using beta = frac{pi}{4} - alpha, we get: [ beta = frac{pi}{4} - arctan left(frac{sqrt{17} - 3}{4}right) ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ alpha = arctan left(frac{sqrt{17} - 3}{4}right) quad text{and} quad beta = frac{pi}{4} - arctan left(frac{sqrt{17} - 3}{4}right) } ]"},{"instruction":"Susie and her sister gathered all 98 of their teddy bears and placed them on the shelves in their bedroom.

Since their sum has to be 4 and there are four elements, each element must be mapped to 1, hence there is only boxed{1} such mapping. - **Case 2**: One element is mapped to 2, the remaining three elements must have images 0, 1, and 1 to sum up to 4.

However, the condition ( R_T > B_B ) violates the symmetry because it implies an imbalance where ( R_T + B_B neq 26 ), leading to a logical inconsistency. 7. **Consequences of the Contradiction**: According to principles of logic, if an initial assumption (in this case, ( R_T > B_B )) leads to a contradiction, then the outcome of having ( R_T ) equal to ( B_B ) must hold in every non-contradictory case. 8. **Final Logical Conclusion**: As the statement ( R_T > B_B ) creates an unsustainable mathematical condition, the opposite assumption — that lower variance in groupings of red and black must maintain consistency — naturally leads to regular disruptions in the card sequencing, ensuring three cards of the same color align more as a frequent consequence.

Since ( g^k(x) geq B geq A ), we have ( g^{k+1}(x) = g(A + [g^k(x) - A + 1]) = g^{g^k(x) - A}(x) + 1 ), which means: [ g^{g^k(x) - A}(x) + 1 = g^{k+1}(x) quad text{for any } k in mathbb{Z}^+. ] 6. **Claim:** ( g^k(x) ) is the unique smallest element in ( G_k = {g^k(x), g^{k+1}(x), g^{k+2}(x), ldots} ). **Proof:** Induct on ( k ). The base case and the inductive step are the same, so we will do them together. Suppose that ( g^t(x) ) is the maximum element of ( G_k ) where ( t > k ). Then by induction hypothesis (if ( k > 1 )): [ g^{ell}(x) > g^{k-1}(x) > g^{k-2}(x) > ldots > g(x) geq A + 1 ] which means ( g^{ell}(x) geq B + k geq A + k ) for any ( ell geq k ). Since ( t-1 geq k ), we get: [ g^{g^{t-1}(x) - A + 1}(x) + 1 = g^t(x) ] but ( g^{t-1}(x) - A + 1 geq k ), which gives the contradiction. (blacksquare) 7. The claim implies ( g(x) < g(g(x)) < ldots ). Thus using the previous result again, we deduce: [ g^k(x) - A + 1 < k + 1 implies g^k(x) leq A + k - 1 ] for any ( k in mathbb{Z}^+ ). This forces ( g(x) = A ), so we are done.

Thus, nu must contribute this additional factor of 5 to the lcm, making nu divisible by 5. We can write nu = 5m where m is a positive integer. Now, we have mathop{text{lcm}}[5m, 30] = 90. Since the 5m contributes the necessary factor of 5, it follows that mathop{text{lcm}}[m, 30] = frac{90}{5} = 18. This is true if and only if m is a divisor of 18 that is relatively prime to 30 (or at least does not introduce any new prime factors that would increase the lcm beyond 18). The divisors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. Since 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5, we exclude divisors of 18 that are not co-prime to 30.

The problem is trivially true for (n = 1). Then the problem for (n = k+1) needs to be examined. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that for some ( k leq 100 ), the statement holds true, i.e., the 100 cities can be divided into two sovereign groups, ( A ) and ( B ), where ( A ) contains ( k ) cities and ( B ) contains ( 100 - k ) cities, and within each group, any city can reach any other city along the road network. 3. **Inductive Step**: Consider the case when ( n = k + 1 ). We need to show that even in this case, it is possible to divide the 100 cities into two sovereign groups such that the properties remain the same. - Select any city ( a_1 ) in group ( B ) which has a direct road connection to group ( A ). Such a city must exist by the problem's constraints. Move this city ( a_1 ) from ( B ) to ( A ). 4. **Network Connectivity Check**: - After moving ( a_1 ) from ( B ) to ( A ), if group ( B ) still remains connected (i.e., any city in ( B ) can reach any other city within ( B ) without passing through group ( A )), then our hypothesis is satisfied for ( n = k + 1 ). 5. **Further Decomposition if Disconnect Occurs**: - Suppose ( B ) becomes disconnected after moving ( a_1 ). This disconnection will result in several non-empty subsets ( B_{11}, B_{12}, ldots, B_{1m_1} ) where ( m_1 geq 2 ). - Proceed by keeping ( a_1 ) in ( B ), and consider the subset ( B_{11} ). By the problem’s principle, there must be some city ( a_2 in B_{11} ) connected to group ( A ). Move ( a_2 ) to ( A ). 6. **Iterative Process**: - Repeat the process iteratively: extract city ( a_i ) from the subset, potentially causing further subdivisions ( {B_{i1}, B_{i2}, ldots, B_{i m_{i}}} ) within ( B_i ). - This forms a sequence of cities ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) and a corresponding decreasing sequence of subsets ( B_{11} supseteq B_{21} supseteq B_{31} supseteq cdots ). 7. **Termination and Proper Division**: - This process will terminate either by finding a city ( a_j ) whose removal and addition to ( A ) maintains the connectivity of ( B - {a_j} ), or reducing to a subset with a single city ( a_{j+1} ). - In the latter case, simply moving ( a_{j+1} ) to ( A ) completes the required division for ( n = k + 1 ). 8. **Conclusion**: Each step ensures that within any subset ( B_i ), removing city ( a_i ) gradually maintains or facilitates the division while maintaining connectivity properties, thereby proving the statement for ( n = k + 1 ).

Let's analyze the problem step by step. 1. **Initial Setup and Operation Description**: - We have (n) numbers arranged in a circle with exactly one (1) and the rest are (0)'s. - An operation consists of picking a number (a), subtracting some positive real (x le a) from it, and adding (alpha x) to each of its neighbors. 2. **Objective**: - We want to make all the numbers in the circle equal after a finite number of operations. 3. **Mathematical Formulation**: - Let the numbers be (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) arranged in a circle. - Initially, (a_i = 1) for some (i) and (a_j = 0) for all (j neq i). 4. **Operation Analysis**: - When we pick (a_i) and subtract (x) from it, we get (a_i - x). - We add (alpha x) to its neighbors (a_{i-1}) and (a_{i+1}). 5. **Invariant Consideration**: - Consider the sum (S = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n). - Initially, (S = 1). - Each operation preserves the sum (S) because (a_i - x + alpha x + alpha x = a_i + (alpha - 1)x). 6. **Condition for Equal Numbers**: - For all numbers to be equal, each (a_i) must be (frac{1}{n}). - This implies that the sum (S = n cdot frac{1}{n} = 1), which is consistent with the initial sum. 7. **Feasibility of Operations**: - We need to check if the operations can transform the initial configuration to the desired configuration where all numbers are equal. - The key is to determine if the operations can distribute the initial (1) uniformly among all (n) positions. 8. **Algebraic Structure**: - The operations can be represented using a matrix transformation. - Let (A) be the adjacency matrix of the circle graph with (n) vertices. - The operation can be seen as a linear transformation involving (A) and (alpha). 9. **Eigenvalue Analysis**: - The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix (A) of a circle graph are given by (2 cos left(frac{2pi k}{n}right)) for (k = 0, 1, ldots, n-1). - For the transformation to be possible, (alpha) must be such that the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix allow for the uniform distribution of the initial (1). 10. **Conclusion**: - The pairs ((n, alpha)) that allow for the transformation are those where (alpha = 2 cos left(frac{kpi}{n}right)) for some integer (k). - This ensures that the eigenvalues of the transformation matrix are suitable for achieving the uniform distribution. The final answer is ( boxed{ (n, alpha) } ) such that (alpha = 2 cos left(frac{kpi}{n}right)) for some integer (k)."},{"instruction":"From an 8 times 8 chessboard, 10 squares have been cut out, including both white and black squares.

Each domino covers one white square and one black square. 1. ***Total Squares and Dominoes on a Chessboard***: An 8 times 8 chessboard has 64 squares. Each domino covers 2 squares, so the maximum number of dominoes we can have on a complete chessboard is: [ frac{64}{2} = 32 ] 2. ***Squares Removed and Resulting Dominoes***: If we remove 10 squares from the 8 times 8 chessboard, we need to consider the effect on the number of possible dominoes: - Removed 10 squares means: [ 64 - 10 = 54 text{ squares remaining} ] Given that each domino must cover one white square and one black square, the maximum number of dominoes we can form from these 54 squares is: [ frac{54}{2} = 27 ] 3. ***Imperfect Removal Distribution Calculation***: However, because the removal includes both black and white squares, we have to account for the worst-case distribution to determine the maximum guaranteed number of complete dominoes: - If 9 squares of one color are removed (considering the worst case): [ 32 text{ black squares or 32 white squares} - 9 = 23 text{ remaining squares of one color} ] - This means there would be a total of (23 + 31) = 54 text{ squares remaining (combination of colors)}. 4. ***Final Domino Arrangement***: After removing 10 squares from the 64-square board, there will be at least: [ 54 text{ remaining squares} ] which translates to, at maximum: [ boxed{23} text{ dominoes or 1 times 2 rectangles that are left intact.} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of complete 1 times 2 dominoes that can be guaranteed after removing 10 squares (with both black and white involved) from an 8 times 8 chessboard is: [ boxed{23} ]"},{"instruction":"triangle triangle ABC, given tan frac{C}{2}=sin left(A+Bright), which of the following four statements are correct?

D: The value of sin ^{2}A+sin ^{2}B+sin ^{2}C is a constant.","output":"Given that in triangle triangle ABC, we have tan frac{C}{2}=sin left(A+Bright). We need to evaluate the truthfulness of statements A, B, C, and D. **Step 1: Analyze the given equation** Since A+B+C=180^{circ}, we can infer that sin left(A+Bright)=sin C. This is because the sine function is periodic and sin (theta) = sin (180^{circ}-theta) for any angle theta. **Step 2: Simplify tan frac{C}{2}** Given tan frac{C}{2}=sin left(A+Bright), we know that tan frac{C}{2}=frac{sin C}{1+cos C}. Substituting sin left(A+Bright) for sin C, we get tan frac{C}{2}=frac{sin(A+B)}{1+cos C}=sin left(A+Bright). **Step 3: Determine the value of cos C** From the equation tan frac{C}{2}=sin left(A+Bright), we deduce that cos C=0. Given that C is an angle in a triangle and lies in the interval (0^{circ}, 180^{circ}), the only possible value for C that satisfies cos C=0 is C=90^{circ}. **Step 4: Calculate the implications for A and B** With C=90^{circ}, we have A+B=90^{circ}. - For statement A, cos Acos B=cos Acos(90^{circ}-A)=cos Asin A=frac{1}{2}sin 2A. The maximum value of sin 2A is 1, so the maximum value of frac{1}{2}sin 2A is frac{1}{2}. Therefore, statement A is correct. - For statement B, sin A+sin B=sin A+cos A=sqrt{2}sin(A+45^{circ}). Since Ain (0^{circ}, 90^{circ}), A+45^{circ}in (45^{circ}, 135^{circ}), and thus sin(A+45^{circ})in (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1]. Therefore, sin A+sin Bin (1, sqrt{2}], which means statement B is incorrect. **Step 5: Evaluate statement C** For statement C, tan A+tan B=frac{sin A}{cos A}+frac{sin B}{cos B}=frac{sin A}{cos A}+frac{cos A}{sin A}=frac{1}{sin Acos A}=frac{2}{sin 2A}. Since Ain (0^{circ}, 90^{circ}), sin 2Ain (0,1], which implies tan A+tan Bin [2,+infty). Therefore, statement C is correct. **Step 6: Analyze statement D** For statement D, sin^2A+sin^2B+sin^2C=sin^2A+cos^2A+sin^2C=1+1=2. This shows that the value of sin^2A+sin^2B+sin^2C is indeed a constant, which makes statement D correct. **Conclusion** The correct choices are ACD.

The prime factorization of 11 raised to the power of 2 is (11^2), which has 2 prime factors (both 11s).

The rook can move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent cell. We aim to minimize the maximum difference between the numbers in these adjacent cells. 1. **Zig-Zag Pattern:**    Consider a zig-zag pattern where the rook travels through the board. For an ( n times n ) board, the rook starts at the top-left corner and moves right until it reaches the end of the row, then moves down to the next row and moves left, and so on. This pattern ensures that each cell is visited exactly once. 2. **Numbering the Cells:**    Number the cells in the order the rook visits them.

For example, in the ( 3 times 3 ) board:    - Horizontal differences: ( |2-1| = 1 ), ( |3-2| = 1 ), ( |5-6| = 1 ), etc.    - Vertical differences: ( |6-3| = 3 ), ( |7-6| = 1 ), etc. 4. **Generalizing for ( n times n ) Board:**    For an ( n times n ) board, the maximum difference in the zig-zag pattern occurs when moving from the end of one row to the start of the next row. This difference is ( 2n-1 ). 5. **Proof of Minimality:**    To prove that ( 2n-1 ) is the minimal possible value of ( M ), consider any other pattern of movement. Any pattern must visit each cell exactly once, and the maximum difference will always be at least ( 2n-1 ) due to the need to transition between rows.

Step 1: Base Case Consider a polynomial of degree zero, i.e., a constant polynomial ( P(x) = c ). If ( c ) is rational, the statement holds trivially because there are no other coefficients.  Step 2: Induction Hypothesis Assume the statement is true for all polynomials of degree ( n-1 ). That is, if a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ) takes rational values at ( n ) rational points, then all its coefficients are rational.  Step 3: Induction Step Now consider a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ) that takes rational values at ( n+1 ) rational points ( x_0, x_1, ldots, x_n ).  According to the polynomial remainder theorem (also known as the theorem of Bézout), for any polynomial ( P(x) ) and any root ( x_0 ), [ P(x) - P(x_0) = (x - x_0)Q(x), ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ).

As ( Q(x) ) takes rational values at ( n ) rational points, by the induction hypothesis, all coefficients of ( Q(x) ) are rational.  Step 3.3: Reconstructing the Polynomial Rewriting ( P(x) ) from its relationship with ( Q(x) ): [ P(x) = (x - x_0)Q(x) + P(x_0). ] Given that ( Q(x) ) has rational coefficients and ( P(x_0) ) is rational, the coefficients of the product ((x - x_0)Q(x)) and ( P(x_0) ) must also be rational. Therefore, all coefficients of ( P(x) ) must be rational. # Conclusion By induction, the statement holds for polynomials of all degrees.

We need to find the values of t such that triangle ABC is isosceles. We consider three cases based on which sides of the triangle are equal. **Case 1: AB = AC** For AB = AC, C must lie on the perpendicular bisector of overline{AB}. Since A and B are points on the unit circle, and AB = AC, C must be symmetric to B with respect to A. This implies C is the reflection of B across the line through A and the origin (since A and B are on the unit circle).  The angle angle BAO is 60^circ - 40^circ = 20^circ. Therefore, the angle angle OAC is also 20^circ, and thus t = 40^circ + 20^circ = 60^circ. However, this makes C coincide with B, which is not allowed. Instead, C should be at the reflection of B across A on the other side, which is 40^circ - 20^circ = 20^circ. Thus, t = 20^circ. **Case 2: BA = BC** For BA = BC, A must lie on the perpendicular bisector of overline{BC}. By similar reasoning as in Case 1, C must be symmetric to A with respect to B.  The angle angle AB0 is 60^circ - 40^circ = 20^circ. Therefore, the angle angle OBC is also 20^circ, and thus t = 60^circ + 20^circ = 80^circ. **Case 3: CA = CB** For CA = CB, B must lie on the perpendicular bisector of overline{AC}. C must be symmetric to A with respect to B.  The angle angle BAO is 60^circ - 40^circ = 20^circ. Therefore, C can be at 40^circ + 20^circ = 60^circ or at 40^circ - 20^circ = 20^circ. However, 60^circ coincides with B, so we discard it. Instead, C can be at 180^circ - 20^circ = 160^circ from B on the other side, which is 60^circ + 160^circ = 220^circ or 60^circ - 160^circ = -100^circ (which is equivalent to 260^circ). However, these do not satisfy the condition CA = CB. Instead, C should be at 50^circ and 230^circ (symmetrically placed around B). Adding all valid t values, we have 20 + 80 + 50 + 230 = 380.

The perimeter is given and equals ( P = a + b + c ). 2. **Consider ( triangle AB'C ), where ( B' ) is chosen such that ( triangle AB'C ) is isosceles with ( AB' = AC ):**        This ( triangle AB'C ) has the same base ( AC ) and the same perimeter as ( triangle ABC ). According to the isoperimetric inequality and properties of isosceles triangles, ( triangle AB'C ) has an area that is at least as large as that of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Construct another isosceles triangle ( triangle ADE ) with ( AD = DE ) and a base ( AE ):**        We take ( AD = frac{P}{3} ) where ( angle DAE = angle BAC' ), and the perimeter of this triangle is also ( P ). It follows from the perimeter condition that ( AE > AC ) since ( AB > AD ). 4. **Analyze the area of ( triangle ADE ):**        Given that ( AB ) is greater than ( AD ), the altitude from ( D ) of ( triangle ADE ) is greater than the altitude from ( C' ) of ( triangle AB'C ), implying that     [    S_{triangle ADE} > S_{triangle ABC'}    ].    This shows ( triangle ADE ) has a greater area than ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Now, consider an equilateral triangle:**        Construct an equilateral triangle ( triangle ADF ) with sides equal to ( frac{P}{3} ). Since this is an equilateral triangle with the given perimeter, it has the maximum possible area among triangles by definition and properties of equilateral triangles and symmetry arguments. 6. **Chain of inequalities:**        We have already established the chain of inequalities for areas:    [    S_{triangle ABC} leq S_{triangle ABC'} < S_{triangle ADE} < S_{triangle ADF}    ]    Therefore, the area of the equilateral triangle ( triangle ADF ) must be at least as large as any other triangle with the same perimeter ( P ). Hence, the proof is complete, concluding that the equilateral triangle indeed has the largest area among triangles with a given perimeter. (blacksquare) Similarly:  for quadrilaterals: 1. **Let ( ABCD ) be any quadrilateral:**        We dissect it into two triangles by its diagonal ( AC ). 2. **Replace ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ACD ) with isosceles triangles ( triangle AB'C ) and ( triangle ACD' ):**        By ensuring ( AB' = AC ) and ( AD' = AC ) but maintaining the perimeter, each isosceles triangle constructed has at least the area of the original triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ACD ) respectively. 3. **Combine ( triangle AB'C ) and ( triangle ACD' ) into a convex quadrilateral:**        This new quadrilateral matches the area criteria due to its isosceles properties for maximum triangle areas. 4. **Forming a rhombus and then a square:**        By replacing these isosceles triangles by further refining their symmetry into a rhombus, and then knowing a square offers the largest area given the symmetry and properties of equality of sides and right angles. Converting the rhombus into a square with the same perimeter ensures maximum area configuration. 5. **Chain of inequalities for areas:**        From properties:    [    S_{ABCD} leq S_{AB'C'D'} leq S_{A'B'C'D'} leq S_{A''B''C''D''}    ] Resulting in the square having the maximum area.

The distribution given is N(60, 100), which means the mean mu = 60 and the variance sigma^2 = 100, so the standard deviation sigma = 10. We're given that 13 students scored at or above 90. To find the proportion, denoted as P(X geq 90), we need to standardize the score and look up the corresponding value in the standard normal distribution table (Z-table). The standardized score (z-score) for 90 is calculated as  z = frac{X - mu}{sigma} = frac{90 - 60}{10} = 3.  Looking up the corresponding value for z = 3 in the Z-table gives us the cumulative probability for all scores below 90. Since we want the proportion above 90, we take 1 - P(Z leq 3). From the Z-table, P(Z leq 3) approx 0.9987, thus  P(X geq 90) = 1 - P(Z leq 3) approx 1 - 0.9987 = 0.0013.  Since 13 students scored at or above 90, and this represents 0.0013 of the total number of students, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total number of students N:  0.0013N = 13.

This will be the z-score that corresponds to the cumulative probability of 1 - 0.0228 = 0.9772. From the Z-table, we find that Z approx 2.

Hence, f(x)-4=0 and f{{'}}(x)=0 have a common real root, which is the maximum point, so (1) is correct. f(x)=0 and f{{'}}(x)=0 have a common real root, which is the minimum point, so (2) is correct. f(x)+3=0 has one real root that is less than the function's smallest zero point, while f(x)-1=0 has three real roots that are all greater than the function's smallest zero point, so (3) is incorrect. f(x)+5=0 has one real root that is less than the function's smallest zero point, while f(x)-2=0 has three real roots that are all greater than the function's smallest zero point, so (4) is correct.

(3) If Mr. Wang's total purchase amount for two transactions is 820, and the amount of the first purchase is a yuan (200 < a < 300), express in terms of a how much Mr. Wang actually paid for the two transactions.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Actual Payment Calculation for Mr. Wang For a one-time purchase of 400: - Since 400 is less than 500 but not less than 200, it qualifies for a 10% discount. - The calculation for the actual payment is 400 times (1 - 0.1) = 400 times 0.9 = 360 yuan. For a one-time purchase of 600: - The first 500 qualifies for a 10% discount, and the remaining 100 (600 - 500) qualifies for a 20% discount. - The calculation for the actual payment is 500 times 0.9 + 100 times 0.8 = 450 + 80 = 530 yuan. Therefore, the actual payments are boxed{360 text{yuan}} and boxed{530 text{yuan}}, respectively.  Part 2: Algebraic Expressions for Actual Payment For a one-time purchase of x yuan, where 200 leq x < 500: - The actual payment is calculated with a 10% discount on the entire amount, which is x times 0.9. - However, the question's standard answer suggests an adjustment with +20, which seems to be an error. Correctly, it should be x times 0.9. For a one-time purchase of x yuan, where x geq 500: - The first 500 has a 10% discount, and the amount exceeding 500 has a 20% discount. - The actual payment is 500 times 0.9 + (x - 500) times 0.8 = 450 + 0.8x - 400 = 0.8x + 50. Therefore, the actual payments are boxed{0.9x text{yuan}} for 200 leq x < 500, and boxed{0.8x + 50 text{yuan}} for x geq 500.  Part 3: Total Actual Payment for Two Transactions by Mr. Wang Given the total purchase amount for two transactions is 820, and the first purchase amount a is between 200 and 300: - The first transaction gets a 10% discount, so the actual payment is 0.9a. - The second transaction's amount is 820 - a, and since a < 300, 820 - a > 500, qualifying for the mixed discount rate. The actual payment for the second transaction is 450 + 0.8(820 - a - 500). - Summing these gives the total actual payment: 0.9a + 450 + 0.8(820 - a - 500) = 0.9a + 450 + 0.8 times 320 - 0.8a = 0.1a + 706.

Suppose ( k geqslant 6 ). Consider guards positioned in the corners of the board. Each of them must be seen by at least 6 other guards. Since a guard in a corner can be seen only along the two lines (either a row or a column), there must be at least 6 guards observing each corner guard.

Therefore, if 2 moles of benzene are required and the total amount of benzene is given as 156, we need to find the molar mass of benzene to determine how many moles of benzene 156 represents. The molar mass of benzene (C6H6) is calculated as follows: - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol. - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.008 g/mol.

We need to prove that there exist indices (k, l in {1, ldots, 98}) such that (a_k = a_l) and (a_{k+1} = a_{l+1}). 2. **Assume the contrary:**    Suppose all pairs ((a_i, a_{i+1})) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 98) are distinct. Denote the set of these pairs by (S). Thus, (|S| = 98). 3. **Define the set of all possible pairs:**    Let (X) be the set of all pairs ((x, y)) where (x, y in {0, 1, ldots, 9}). Clearly, (|X| = 100). 4. **Remove invalid pairs:**    Since ((1, 2)) and ((3, 4)) do not belong to (S), we have:    [    |S| = 98 quad text{and} quad |X setminus {(1, 2), (3, 4)}| = 100 - 2 = 98    ]    This means (S) is obtained from (X) by removing ((1, 2)) and ((3, 4)). 5. **Graph theory interpretation:**    Consider a complete directed graph (G) with vertices (V = {0, 1, ldots, 9}).

First, let's convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min) since the volume is given in cubic meters per minute (m³/min). 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 60 minutes Flow rate in m/min = 5 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (60 min/hour) Flow rate in m/min = 5000 m/hour / 60 min/hour Flow rate in m/min = 83.33 m/min Now, we know the volume of water flowing into the sea per minute (V) is 7500 m³/min, the depth of the river (d) is 2 m, and the flow rate (FR) is 83.33 m/min. We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which in this case is the cross-section of the river): Volume = Width * Depth * Flow Rate We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width (W): Width = Volume / (Depth * Flow Rate) Plugging in the values we have: Width = 7500 m³/min / (2 m * 83.33 m/min) Width = 7500 m³/min / 166.66 m²/min Width = 45 m Therefore, the river is boxed{45}  meters wide."},{"instruction":"Kindergarten teachers are giving out apples to children.

If each child receives 3 apples, there will be 1 apple left. This means that the total number of apples, minus 1, is divisible by 3. 2. If each child receives 4 apples, there will be 2 apples short. This means that if we add 2 to the total number of apples, it becomes divisible by 4. Let's denote the total number of apples by x. Based on the conditions: 1. The first condition can be represented as the total number of apples x, when divided by 3, leaves a remainder of 1. This can be mathematically written as dfrac{x-1}{3}. 2. The second condition implies that when you add 2 to the total number of apples x, and then divide by 4, it perfectly divides. This can be represented as dfrac{x+2}{4}.

The boat sinks by 1 cm when a man with a mass of 60 kg gets on it. What is the length of the boat?","output":"To find the length of the boat, we can use the principle of buoyancy, which states that the weight of the water displaced by an object is equal to the weight of the object. In this case, when the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1 cm, which means that the volume of water displaced by the boat is equal to the volume of the boat that sinks below the waterline. Let's denote the length of the boat as L (in meters). The breadth of the boat is given as 2 m. When the man gets on the boat, the boat sinks by 1 cm, which is 0.01 m. The volume of water displaced (V) can be calculated as: V = L (length) * B (breadth) * h (height sunk) Given that B = 2 m and h = 0.01 m, we have: V = L * 2 * 0.01 The weight of the water displaced (W_water) is equal to the mass of the man (m_man) times the acceleration due to gravity (g), which is approximately 9.81 m/s^2. The density of water (ρ_water) is approximately 1000 kg/m^3. W_water = m_man * g W_water = 60 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 W_water = 588.6 N (Newtons) Since the weight of the water displaced is equal to the buoyant force, we can equate W_water to the weight of the volume of water displaced: W_water = ρ_water * V * g 588.6 N = 1000 kg/m^3 * V * 9.81 m/s^2 Now we can solve for V: V = 588.6 N / (1000 kg/m^3 * 9.81 m/s^2) V = 588.6 N / 9810 N/m^3 V = 0.06 m^3 Now we can use the volume of water displaced to find the length of the boat: V = L * 2 * 0.01 0.06 m^3 = L * 2 * 0.01 0.06 m^3 = L * 0.02 m^2 L = 0.06 m^3 / 0.02 m^2 L = 3 m Therefore, the length of the boat is boxed{3}  meters."},{"instruction":"Sara had 100.0 pennies and 783.0 quarters in her bank .

The area of the square is (2pi)^2 = 4pi^2, and the area of the circle is pi(sqrt{pi})^2 = pi^2. Therefore, the probability that the point (a, b) lies outside the circle (and thus the function f(x) has a root) is the ratio of the area outside the circle to the total area of the square, which is frac{4pi^2 - pi^2}{4pi^2} = frac{3pi^2}{4pi^2} = frac{3}{4}.

Therefore, the annual profit P(x) can be calculated as follows: - **When 0 < x < 10 thousand units:** The variable cost is given by C(x) = frac{9}{x} + 7x - 14 thousand dollars.

The selling price of the article to gain 20% should be Rs. 168. What is the percentage of loss when the article is sold for Rs. 119?","output":"Let's denote the cost price of the article as CP. According to the information given, when the shopkeeper sells the article for Rs. 168, they gain 20%. This means that the selling price (SP) at a 20% gain is Rs. 168. We can express the 20% gain as a factor of the cost price: SP = CP + (20% of CP) SP = CP + (0.20 * CP) SP = CP * (1 + 0.20) SP = CP * 1.20 Now we know that SP is Rs. 168 when there is a 20% gain, so we can write: 168 = CP * 1.20 To find the cost price (CP), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20: CP = 168 / 1.20 CP = 140 Now we have the cost price of the article, which is Rs. 140. When the article is sold for Rs. 119, there is a loss. We can calculate the loss as the difference between the cost price and the selling price at Rs. 119: Loss = CP - SP (when SP is Rs. 119) Loss = 140 - 119 Loss = 21 The percentage of loss can be calculated as the loss divided by the cost price, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage of Loss = (Loss / CP) * 100 Percentage of Loss = (21 / 140) * 100 Percentage of Loss = 0.15 * 100 Percentage of Loss = 15% Therefore, the percentage of loss when the article is sold for Rs. 119 is boxed{15%} ."},{"instruction":"Find the value of text{B} in the product shown below, where text{B} is a digit.

Let's label the vertices of the octahedron as A, B, C, A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1}, where:    - (A, A_{1}), (B, B_{1}), and (C, C_{1}) are pairs of opposite vertices.    2. Each vertex in an octahedron is connected to every vertex excluding the opposite vertex. Notably, an octahedron has 12 edges. 3. To find an Eulerian circuit (a path that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting point), we need to ensure that all vertices in the graph have even degrees. In our octahedron:    - Each vertex has a degree of 4, which is even. Thus, it is possible to find an Eulerian circuit. 4. A possible path for the fly can be described as follows:    [    A rightarrow B rightarrow A_{1} rightarrow C_{1} rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A rightarrow C_{1} rightarrow B_{1} rightarrow C rightarrow A_{1} rightarrow B_{1} rightarrow A    ] 5. This path covers each edge exactly once and returns to the initial vertex A.      Part (b): Cube 1. A cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges. 2. In a cube, each vertex is connected by exactly 3 edges. Hence, each vertex has a degree of 3, which is odd. 3. For an Eulerian circuit to exist, every vertex in the corresponding graph must have an even degree. Since this condition is not satisfied (each vertex has an odd degree of 3), it is impossible to find an Eulerian circuit in a cubic graph. 4. Therefore, the fly cannot traverse all edges exactly once and return to the starting vertex. # Conclusion The answers for the given cases are: - (a) The fly can traverse each edge of the octahedron exactly once and return to the starting vertex.  - (b) The fly cannot traverse each edge of the cube exactly once and return to the starting vertex.

Let's consider if AA_1 equals the median BB_2 or the bisector BB_3 from vertex B. 3. If this is the case, then AA_1 cannot be shorter than height BB_1 since we assumed AA_1 is the shortest height.

Using these conditions, S' is determined as the intersection of lines S_1 T and S_2 Q. 5. To reconstruct the missing face adjacent to edge D C, draw a perpendicular line from S' to D C and intersect this with the circle centered at D with radius D S_2. Let this intersection point be S_3. Then, the required face is C D S_3. 6. Similarly, follow the same procedure for the other missing face to complete the construction. The requirement for constructing the network accurately involves the conditions that A S_1 = A S_2 and alpha_1 + alpha_2 > alpha, where alpha_1 and alpha_2 are the angles of the faces at S_1 and S_2, and alpha is the angle at vertex A of the base. 7. This method can be generalized to a pyramid with an arbitrary number of sides.

Observe that CE = IE (since I is the center of the inscribed circle, and E is the tangent point, both segments CE and IE are radii of the circle). 3. In the right triangle IEB, the angle angle IBE is 30^circ. Consequently, angle EIB = 60^circ because triangle IEB forms a right triangle (angle IEB = 90^circ). 4. Therefore, triangle IDE forms an equilateral triangle. This conclusion comes from the fact that angle IDE = angle EID = 60^circ and all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, i.e., CE = IE = DE. 5. By what has been proven, CE = IE = DE.

I made a hole in one cube so that the smaller cube could pass through it. After weighing both cubes, I found that the larger cube was still heavier than the smaller one! How could this happen?","output":"1. **Understanding the problem context**:    - We have two lead cubes.    - One of the cubes is slightly larger than the other.    - A hole is drilled in one of the cubes.    - The purpose of the hole is to allow the smaller cube to pass through it completely.     2. **Focusing on the main query**:    - Upon weighing both cubes (after the drilling process), it is found that the larger cube remains heavier than the smaller one.    - We need to explain why this occurs. 3. **Geometrical and Physical insight**:    - Consider the fact that the operation did not involve the larger cube having a hole drilled into it directly.    - When the diagonal of a cube is taken as an axis, the projection of the cube on a plane perpendicular to this diagonal would form a regular hexagon.     4. **Mathematical and Geometrical Representation**:    - Let's imagine the small cube with its diagonal (let's call it (AB)) being perpendicular to a horizontal plane. This configuration can project a hexagonal cross-section.    - A simpler mental model: when you project a cube through its diagonal, any such plane of projection appears as a hexagon.     5. **Practical Implementation**:    - In the actual drilling, making a hole in one cube was enough just large enough for the diagonal side of the smaller cube to fit through.    - Consider the spatial aspect where this drilling process happened in the smaller cube, which makes sense because fitting an object within another implies a logical deduction: the hole was made in the larger cube. 6. **Weight Consideration**:    - If the hole was drilled in the larger cube, making space for the smaller cube to go through, it would require more material removal, potentially decreasing its weight further (just a hypothetical aspect).    - In our case, the hole was actually made in the smaller cube to allow the larger cube to slide way - which means the smaller cube lost some of its volume due to the hole within it. 7. **Conclusion through direct observation**:    - Thus, since the smaller cube has a hole and has lost some mass due to the drilling process, the larger cube retains its full mass initially, minus any negligible drilling impact if assumed.    - Therefore, the larger cube is heavier because the smaller cube had material removed from it. # Conclusion: Thus, the larger cube remains heavier than the smaller one, even though both can pass through each other due to the drilled hole.

Substituting a=1 gives us: B={x | 0leqslant xleqslant 3} To find Acup B, we combine the intervals of A and B, which results in: Acup B={x | -1leqslant xleqslant 3} For complement_{R}B, considering the real number line excluding the interval of B, we get: complement_{R}B={x | x lt 0 text{ or } x gt 3} Therefore, the answers for part (1) are: - Acup B = boxed{{x | -1leqslant xleqslant 3}} - complement_{R}B = boxed{{x | x lt 0 text{ or } x gt 3}}  Part (2) Given the condition A cap B = B, it implies B subseteq A. **Case 1**: B is an empty set, varnothing. For B to be empty, a-1 > 2a+1 which simplifies to: a < -2 In this case, Bsubseteq A is naturally satisfied because an empty set is a subset of any set. **Case 2**: B is not empty, B neq varnothing. For B to be a subset of A, the conditions are: 1. a-1 < 2a+1 to ensure B is not empty. 2. a-1 geq -1 to align with the lower bound of A. 3. 2a+1 leq 3 to align with the upper bound of A. Solving these inequalities: 1. This is always true for any real a. 2. a geq 0. 3. a leq 1. Combining these results, we get the range for a to be 0 leqslant a leqslant 1 when B is not empty. Therefore, combining the results from both cases, the range of real number a is: boxed{left(-infty, -2right) cup left[0, 1right]}"},{"instruction":"A game show offers a contestant three prizes A, B, and C, each worth a whole number of dollars from 1 to 9999.

F1 should then move the rook to the opposite end horizontally. After that, potential further moves by F2:                  - If F2 moves upwards, the game reduces to a (k) times (m-1) board.         - If F2 moves downwards, the board reduces to (m-k) times n, ensuring that both dimensions are still sufficient. 7. **Final Argument:**    - In all possible cases, the game reduces to a smaller board while keeping no repetition of moves (no return to previous positions).     - Since the initial problem proposed is never smaller than cases like a trivial 1 times 1 board, and each reduction maintains playability (other than the impossible 1 times 1 case), the strategy holds. 8. **Conclusion:**    - The initial assumption of existence of a board where this strategy fails led to a contradiction.    - Therefore, the first player can always ensure their win by always making the longest possible moves first.

To solve this, consider the set S_n = {2^a, 2^{2a}, 2^{3a}, ldots, 2^{na}} for some integer a.

Assume for contradiction that such an infinite set S exists.  For any prime p, consider the values v_p(n) for n in S. Since S is infinite and v_p(n) must be an integer, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be an infinite subset of S where v_p(n) gives the same remainder when divided by any integer q.

Let ( k ) be such a primitive root of ( p ). This means any non-zero residue modulo ( p ) can be expressed as ( k^a mod p ) for ( a ) in the range ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ).      2. **Step 2: Distinctness of cubic residues.**     We need to show that ( p ) has ( p-1 ) distinct cubic residues modulo ( p ).     Let ( k ) be a primitive root of ( p ). Then, any non-zero element modulo ( p ) can be written as ( k^a mod p ) for ( a ) in ( {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). Therefore, if we consider ( k^{3a} mod p ) for ( a ) in this range, these residues should be distinct.

Since ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ), ( p-1 ) is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, ( p-1 ) must divide ( a - b ). But since ( |a - b| < p-1 ) and ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct, this cannot happen.

Since ( n^3 ) ranges over all ( p-1 ) residues and they are distinct modulo ( p ), the sequence ( m^2 - n^3 - 1 ) also consists of ( p-1 ) distinct residues modulo ( p ). As these residues are distinct modulo ( p ), at most one of them can be ( 0 pmod{p} ).     Therefore, for each ( m ) in ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ), at most one value of ( n ) in ( 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ) will make ( m^2 - n^3 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ). 4. **Conclusion:**     Since there are ( p-1 ) possible values for ( m ) and for each ( m ), at most one ( n ) makes ( m^2 - n^3 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ), we conclude that at most ( p-1 ) elements of the set ({ m^2 - n^3 - 1 : 0 < m, n < p }) are divisible by ( p ).

To correct for this, we subtract the cases where at least one company employs no student. - If exactly one company employs no student, there are 3 ways to choose which company that is, and for the remaining students, there are 2^4 = 16 ways to distribute them among the remaining two companies. So, there are 3 times 16 = 48 such cases. - If exactly two companies employ no students, there are 3 ways to choose which two companies those are, and the remaining 4 students must all go to the one remaining company. So, there are 3 times 1 = 3 such cases. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we subtract these from the total, but we've subtracted too much since the cases where all students go to one company have been subtracted twice. There are 3 ways this can happen (one for each company), so we add these back in. Therefore, the total number of ways is 81 - 48 + 3 = 36. The correct answer is boxed{text{B: 36种}}."},{"instruction":"Which of the following points lies in the fourth quadrant? A: (2, sqrt{3}) B: (2, 3) C: (sqrt{6}, 6) D: (2, 3)","output":"To determine which of the given points lies in the fourth quadrant, we need to remember that in the Cartesian coordinate system, the fourth quadrant is where x > 0 and y < 0. Let's examine each option: A: (2, -sqrt{3})  - Here, x = 2 > 0 and y = -sqrt{3} < 0.  - This means point A lies in the fourth quadrant. B: (-2, 3)  - For this point, x = -2 < 0 and y = 3 > 0.  - This indicates point B is in the second quadrant, not the fourth. C: (-sqrt{6}, -6)  - In this case, x = -sqrt{6} < 0 and y = -6 < 0.  - This shows point C is in the third quadrant, not the fourth. D: (2, 3)  - Here, x = 2 > 0 and y = 3 > 0.  - This means point D is in the first quadrant, not the fourth. Given the analysis above, the only point that lies in the fourth quadrant, where x > 0 and y < 0, is: boxed{A.

Find the measure of angle B. 2. If b = 2, find the maximum area of triangle ABC.","output":"1. From the given equation frac{sin A}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}cos B}{b}, by the sine law, we have frac{sin A}{sin A} = frac{sqrt{3}cos B}{sin B}, which simplifies to tan B = sqrt{3}. Hence, B = frac{pi}{3}. 2. Given b = 2, we have cos B = frac{1}{2}. Using the cosine law, we get cos B = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}, which simplifies to a^2 + c^2 = ac + 4. Now, since a^2 + c^2 geq 2ac (by the AM-GM inequality), we have ac leq 4, with equality if and only if a = c. The area of the triangle is given by S = frac{1}{2}acsin B. Since sin B = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (from part 1), we have S leq sqrt{3}, with equality if and only if a = c. Therefore, the maximum area of triangle ABC is achieved when it is an equilateral triangle, with S_{max} = boxed{sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"Given a sequence {a_n} where the first term is 1 and the common difference is 2,   (1) Find the general formula for {a_n};   (2) Let b_n=frac{1}{a_n cdot a_{n1}}, and the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is T_n.

(2) From (1), we have b_n=frac{1}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}=frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{2n-1} - frac{1}{2n+1} right). Thus, the sum of the first n terms T_n = b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_n can be expressed as follows: T_n = frac{1}{2} left( 1 - frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{5} + ldots + frac{1}{2n-1} - frac{1}{2n+1} right) = frac{1}{2} left( 1 - frac{1}{2n+1} right) = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2(2n+1)}  Considering the difference between consecutive terms T_{n+1} - T_n, we get: T_{n+1} - T_n = left( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2(2n+3)} right) - left( frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2(2n+1)} right) = frac{1}{2(2n+1)} - frac{1}{2(2n+3)} = frac{1}{(2n+1)(2n+3)} > 0  Since T_{n+1} > T_n, the sequence {T_n} is increasing.
