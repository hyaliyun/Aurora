You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.  I am facing a new situation today: The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which county experienced more infiltration?","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Dirk County experienced more infiltration as compared to Saulk County. In Dirk County, the steady and continuous rain led to significant water infiltration. The duration of the precipitation event contributed to the gradual saturation of the soil, allowing more water to infiltrate before reaching the infiltration capacity. This continuous infiltration, combined with the volume of precipitation, made the soil highly saturated which eventually led to flooding events.  On the other hand, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms, which result in intense but often short-lived precipitation events. Although these storms lead to significant runoff due to the rainfall rate exceeding the infiltration capacity, the overall infiltration is generally less as compared to the steady rain experienced in Dirk County. This is because the shorter duration of the rainfall does not provide the soil with enough time to saturate, reducing the overall infiltration in comparison to the conditions in Dirk County. Taking into account the infiltration patterns influenced by the amount, type, and duration of the precipitation events, we can conclude that Dirk County experienced more infiltration than Saulk County."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  I am facing a new situation today: White mountains are often visited by tourists because of the many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites and karst phenomena. Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing.

Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article, we can conclude that the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks as compared to the Dome mountains. The White mountains are known for their many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena. The presence of these features indicates that a significant portion of the bedrock in this area is composed of limestone, which is a sedimentary rock. As mentioned in the article, about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to the formation of karst landscapes such as the ones found in the White mountains. Moreover, the majority of cave systems are formed through limestone bedrock, further suggesting that sedimentary rocks have a significant presence in the White mountains. On the other hand, Dome mountains are described as being \\"very massive, of volcanic origin, and excellent for climbing.\\" The volcanic origin of these mountains indicates that their primary composition is likely igneous rocks, which are formed from the solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rocks are distinct from sedimentary rocks, which are formed through the deposition and cementation of mineral and organic particles on the Earth's surface, as well as from the chemical precipitation of minerals from solutions.

The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole 14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy.

One day, someone greeted me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me  _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures. To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan .

Given the question: You are given a new situation: There are two exact copies of planets, Necrulon and Krankor, including the animals and plants on each planet. Recently though, people on Krankor have been wanting to have more space for new buildings. In order to accommodate these new buildings, they have started to cut forests and clear land. The people on Necrulon, however, decided to keep their forests and land rather than further industrialize.  and a hint : Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs.  Please answer this question : Does Krankor have more or less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon? The answer is:","output":"Krankor has less autotrophic organisms than Necrulon. Step 1: Understand the situation - Both planets, Necrulon and Krankor, initially have the same number of autotrophic organisms (plants). - Krankor has started cutting forests and clearing land for new buildings. - Necrulon has decided to maintain its forests and land. Step 2: Consider the impact of deforestation on autotrophic organisms - From the hint, we know that cutting down forests and clearing land reduces the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. - Clearing land often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide stores in autotrophs. Step 3: Compare the number of autotrophic organisms on the two planets - Because Krankor has started cutting forests and clearing land, they are reducing their number of autotrophic organisms. - Necrulon, on the other hand, has decided to maintain their forests and land, preserving their autotrophic organisms. Conclusion: Based on these facts, it is evident that Krankor has fewer autotrophic organisms than Necrulon due to their deforestation and land clearing activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: \\"Where did the revolution come from?\\"  Context: \\"Alexis de Tocqueville described the French Revolution as the inevitable result of the radical opposition created in the 18th century between the monarchy and the men of letters of the Enlightenment. These men of letters constituted a sort of \\"substitute aristocracy that was both all-powerful and without real power\\". This illusory power came from the rise of \\"public opinion\\", born when absolutist centralization removed the nobility and the bourgeoisie from the political sphere. The \\"literary politics\\" that resulted promoted a discourse of equality and was hence in fundamental opposition to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville \\"clearly designates ... the cultural effects of transformation in the forms of the exercise of power\\". Nevertheless, it took another century before cultural approach became central to the historiography, as typified by Robert Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800 (1979).\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The revolution, specifically the French Revolution, emerged from the radical ideological opposition and tension between the monarchy and the Enlightenment thinkers or men of letters during the 18th century. This ideological conflict was a result of the growing influence of the Enlightenment ideas that advocated for reason, liberty, equality, and human rights, which challenged the traditional authority of the monarchy and the societal structure under which it operated. Alexis de Tocqueville, a renowned French political scientist and historian, argued that this shift in power dynamics and growing opposition marked the inevitable emergence of the French Revolution. He described the thinkers of the Enlightenment as a \\"substitute aristocracy\\" which, although devoid of formal political power, wielded considerable influence because of the rise of public opinion. The rise of public opinion stemmed from the centralization of power under the monarchy, which led to the marginalization of the nobility and bourgeoisie from the political process. This process gave rise to the phenomenon of \\"literary politics,\\" which aimed at promoting a discourse centered around concepts like equality and liberty – ideals that were fundamentally opposed to the monarchical regime. De Tocqueville identified the cultural effects of this transformation in the exercise of power as a crucial factor contributing to the revolutionary sentiment and eventual upheaval. However, it took historians another century to recognize the importance of the cultural approach in analyzing the origins of the French Revolution. In this context, Robert Darnton's work, \\"The Business of Enlightenment: A Publishing History of the Encyclopédie, 1775–1800\\" (1979), exemplifies this shift in historiography. Darnton focused on the role of literature and communication in shaping public opinion, disseminating new ideas, and thus catalyzing the revolutionary movement. In conclusion, the revolution, particularly the French Revolution, arose from the ideological opposition between the monarchy and the Enlightenment thinkers, who promoted a discourse of equality and liberty that was fundamentally at odds with the existing regime. This opposition, coupled with the rise of public opinion and the influence of \\"literary politics,\\" led to a growing revolutionary sentiment that eventually culminated in the upheaval of the established order. The cultural approach to understanding the origins of the revolution emerged as a vital perspective in historiography, highlighting the significance of ideas and their dissemination in shaping political transformations."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired. This was the only game during the 2013 season in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys.

Information:  - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.  - Stephan Groth ( born August 10 , 1971 in Odense , Denmark ) is the man behind Apoptygma Berzerk , an electronic body music act that plays in styles such as synthpop , ebm , and futurepop . Stephan Leonard Groth was born in Odense , Denmark but relocated with his family to his father 's home town Sarpsborg , Norway in 1986 . Along with Ronan Harris of VNV Nation and the members of Covenant , he is considered by many to be one of the pioneers of the futurepop genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s . Groth is also a member of Fairlight Children , which is a lighter , more pop - oriented electronic act . Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo .  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\"  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk.  - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German).  - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of \\"Shallow Nation\\", the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, \\"Serenity is the Devil\\", was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member.  - Unheilig (German for \\"Unholy\\") is a German band that features a variety of influences including various pop and electronic styles as well as harder, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in 1999 and principally consists of singer Bernd Heinrich \\"Der Graf\\" Graf along with various musical partners. He has been accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \\"Licky\\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \\"Potti\\" Potthoff. The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music.  - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg.  - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named \\"Tybalt\\" is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\".  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of...  - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\".  - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805  4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality.  - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\". Apoptygma Berzerk has over 30 releases and won awards and Top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement.  - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.  - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at . It lies at the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest of the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica.

What are the basic functions of a brain? Select from: - no; - yes;","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. Although the function of the brain is an integral part of understanding the basic functions of a human being, they address different aspects of human physiology and cognition. 1. What are the basic functions of a human being? The basic functions of a human being can be divided into three main categories: physiological functions, cognitive functions, and social functions.  Physiological functions include: - Respiration: The process of breathing to supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. - Circulation: The transport of blood and oxygen throughout the body. - Digestion: The breakdown of food and absorption of nutrients. - Excretion: The elimination of waste from the body. - Reproduction: The process of producing offspring to ensure the survival of the species. - Growth and maintenance: The development and repair of tissues and organs. Cognitive functions include: - Perception: The ability to receive and interpret sensory stimuli from the environment. - Memory: The retention, retrieval, and processing of information. - Learning: The acquisition and application of knowledge. - Problem-solving: The process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving challenges. - Creativity: The ability to generate novel ideas and concepts. - Communication: The exchange of information and emotions. Social functions include: - Interaction: The process of relating to others and forming connections. - Cooperation: Working together with others to achieve common goals. - Competition: The struggle between individuals or groups for resources or status. - Empathy: The understanding and sharing of others' feelings and experiences. - Moral and ethical reasoning: The ability to evaluate and make judgments about what is right and wrong. 2. What are the basic functions of a brain? The brain is the central organ of the nervous system and plays a critical role in controlling and coordinating various cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes. The basic functions of the brain can be divided into several categories: - Sensory processing: The brain processes and interprets sensory information received from the body's sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. - Motor control: The brain controls and coordinates the movements of muscles, enabling voluntary and involuntary actions. - Homeostasis regulation: The brain helps regulate and maintain the body's internal balance, including temperature and blood pressure. - Emotion and motivation: The brain generates emotional responses and drives behavior based on internal and external stimuli. - Memory and learning: The brain facilitates the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information and helps adapt to new situations through learning. - Consciousness and self-awareness: The brain enables higher cognitive functions such as self-reflection, self-awareness, and decision-making. In conclusion, while the brain is a crucial component of human functioning, it is important to distinguish between the basic functions of a human being and the basic functions of a brain, as they address different aspects of human existence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

The 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, USA, featured a unique mix of events, some of which have faded into obscurity over time. One such event was roque, a variation of the popular lawn game croquet. The sport of roque has similarities to its more well-known counterpart, but with its smaller playing area and hard rubber balls, it offered a different set of challenges to competitors. Roque was originally introduced to the Olympics as a way to showcase an American variation of an already established sport. At the time, croquet was predominantly played in Europe, and the addition of roque was seen as an opportunity to provide a more local flavor to the Games. Unfortunately, due to the event's limited popularity, the 1904 Olympics proved to be the one and only time roque was featured on the Olympic program. Despite its fleeting moment in the Olympic spotlight, roque offers an interesting look into the evolution of sports and the impact of regional adaptations. Like judo, a martial art developed in Japan and later embraced as an Olympic event, roque was a regional variation that briefly captured the attention of international audiences. It's a testament to the way the Olympics can bring together diverse communities and cultures, introducing millions of viewers to new and unfamiliar sports. These obscure sports from past Olympics serve as a reminder of the rich history and diverse range of competitions that have been featured at the Games. While the modern Olympic Games might not include events like roque anymore, the opportunity for millions of people to come together and embrace lesser-known sports, athletes, and nations remains a fundamental part of the Olympic experience. So, while today's viewers may not be able to enjoy the curious world of roque, they can still treasure the bewilderingly diverse range of events and experiences that the Olympics have to offer. From judokas in Slovenia to roque players in St. Louis, the Olympics continue to be a unique platform for global discovery and camaraderie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. Question: The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\"  is that   _  . Answer: A:","output":"The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\" is that the apples and pears consumed by children may have high levels of pesticide residues on them, potentially exceeding the safety limits. This is due to the way that pesticide levels are measured and reported by the government. Instead of measuring individual fruit samples, researchers crush a batch of 10 fruits and take an average reading of the pesticide levels, which may not accurately represent the pesticide exposure for each fruit. Furthermore, government data shows that pesticide levels are not evenly distributed across the batch, meaning that one or two fruits could contain 90% or more of the pesticide residue. This can result in children unwittingly consuming dangerous amounts of pesticides on a daily basis, which can have harmful effects on their hormones and may increase their risk of cancer. The researchers did note, however, that British-grown fruits tend to have lower levels of pesticides than imported fruits, so buying locally-produced fruits could help reduce the potential risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Adolescence The timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.

Article: From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided; when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in fact, playing a complicated and potentially dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction. This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are too many possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favor of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start. The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic learning, to distinguish it from individual learning that an animal does in the cause of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning. In the great majority of animals, behavior is a compound of individual experience added to the action patterns animals are born with.That is why animals can survive. Question: Most animals survive because they can make right decisions by   _  . - a series of trials and errors - knowledge obtained in their life time - the nervous system - genetic learning and individual experience A:","output":"Most animals survive because they can make right decisions by genetic learning and individual experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:-  Dirty dishes are placed in the dishwasher - The dishwasher is closed - The dishwasher heats water to a hotter temperature - The dishwasher directs water toward the dishes through jets - The dishwasher adds detergent - The dirty water drains out - The dishwasher sprays more water to rinse the dishes off - The water drains out again - The dishwasher directs warm air toward the dishes to dry them  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"The last step in the dishwasher process, after the dishes have been dried by the warm air, is to signal the end of the cycle and ensure that everything has been done properly. This step includes the following actions: 1. Completion Indicator: Most dishwashers are equipped with an indicator light or display that notifies the user that the dishwashing cycle is complete. This can be a simple light turning on, changing color, or a display message such as \\"Cycle Finished\\" or \\"Clean.\\" 2. Cool-down phase: After the dishes have been dried by the warm air, the dishwasher may go through a brief cool-down phase to allow the internal temperature of the appliance to decrease. This ensures that when the user opens the dishwasher, they will not be exposed to any excessive lingering heat or steam. 3. Power-saving mode or auto shut-off: Many modern dishwashers are designed with energy efficiency in mind. As a part of the last step, the dishwasher may automatically enter a power-saving mode or shut off completely to conserve energy and reduce electricity consumption. This also prevents the appliance from continuously running, which can lead to unnecessary wear and tear. 4. Dish reorganization and quality control: At this stage, the user plays an active role. After being notified that the cycle is complete and the dishwasher is safe to open, the user should inspect the dishes to ensure they are clean and dry. If any stubborn residues remain or if a dish has been dislodged during the cycle, the user may need to reorganize the contents and run a brief additional wash or rinse cycle.  5. Unloading and storing the dishes: Once the quality of cleaned dishes is confirmed, the user can carefully unload the dishwasher, taking caution with any items that may still be hot or sharp. The dishes should be organized and returned to their respective storage areas in a neat and orderly manner. 6. Cleaning and maintenance: After unloading, it's essential to ensure the dishwasher itself remains clean and in proper working order. The user should check the dishwasher's filter for debris, wipe down the door seals, and inspect the dishwasher's interior for residue. Regular cleaning and maintenance ensure the dishwasher's optimal performance and extend its overall lifespan. In conclusion, the last step of the dishwasher process involves signaling the end of the cycle, entering a power-saving mode or shutting off, reviewing the quality of cleaned dishes, unloading and organizing the dishwasher contents, and performing proper cleaning and maintenance to prepare for the next use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted.  Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's, Dr. Bizet, arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.  As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows. The answer to this question is:","output":"Kristan, the professor, is assumed to have attacked his fiance while he was in an entranced state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"so, there's where the money goes.\\" Hypothesis: \\"That isn't where the money goes.\\" Step 2: Assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise seems to be asserting that one has found where the money goes. The hypothesis, however, contradicts this by stating that the identified location is not where the money goes. Step 3: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis. In the context of logic, to entail means that the truth of one statement should lead to the truth of another statement. In this case, the truth of the premise should lead to the truth of the hypothesis if they are entailed. Step 4: Compare the premise and hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis contradict each other, with the premise asserting the location of the money while the hypothesis negates it. Step 5: Choose the appropriate option.

Title: The Quick and the Dead Movie plot: Duncan McKaskel (Tom Conti) and his wife, Susanna (Kate Capshaw), a married couple who, along with their 12-year-old son, Tom (Kenny Morrison), are travelling West hoping to start a new life. They have left a cholera-stricken wagon train and, alone, arrive in a small dilapidated town. Here, they meet no-good Doc Shabbitt (Matt Clark) and ask for directions. He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons. Vallian witnesses the homesteader's encounter with Shabbit and turns up at the McKaskel's wagon during supper. He advises them their horses have been stolen. Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang. When Doc Shabbitt finds that his son, who was about to shoot McKaskel in the back, has been killed, he vows to pursue the family and seek revenge. Susanna, Duncan, and Tom flee in their covered wagon, trying to keep ahead of their pursuers. Vallian keeps arriving to help protect them from Shabbitt and his gang. As time passes, Vallian manages to kill the bandits one by one. The remaining four keep up their pursuit. Vallian is obviously attracted to Susanna, and she to him. Following a moment of high drama, she succumbs to his advances and they share a passionate kiss. McKaskel never learns of the kiss, but tells Vallian, who is critical of his apparent pacifism, to back off several times. In an encounter with Indians, Susanna learns that her brother, an army officer, has likely been killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Out hunting, Vallian is shot.

I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If more carbon dioxide is present, it will directly impact a step of the process and indirectly impact another step. First, the direct impact: An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the body will result in a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) formed as carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). This will lower the pH of the blood, making it more acidic. This condition is known as respiratory acidosis. The indirect impact: The presence of a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and a lower pH in the blood affects the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, causing the hemoglobin to have a lower affinity for oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect. As a result, the hemoglobin will be less effective at picking up and delivering a smaller amount of oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.

Context: By 1851, Burma had been greatly weakened, and the British were ready to pounce again. Using a fine of two British ships by the mayor of Rangoon as the excuse, Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of India, sent an ultimatum to rescind the fine, remove the offending mayor, and pay a fine of a one thousand pounds. The Burmese neither wanted nor were ready for a war. They quickly accepted the British demands. But the British officer on the scene, Commodore George Lambert, blockaded the port of Rangoon anyway. On 18 February 1852, Dalhousie increased the demand a hundredfold to one hundred thousand pounds sterling. On 12 April 1852, the British navy invaded Rangoon. King Pagan sent four armies to meet the enemy. The Burmese put up tough resistance at Bassein  and Pegu but by June, much of Lower Burma belonged to the invaders. After the end of the rainy season, in November, the British took Prome, and pushed up to Myede on the Irrawaddy, and took Toungoo on the Sittaung, facing minimal Burmese resistance. In December, Prince of Mindon raised a rebellion against his brother the king. On 20 December 1852, the British issued a proclamation of annexation, taking Lower Burma, up to the latitude running directly east-west across the country to the borders of Karenni states, 6 miles  north of Myede . It took three years to \\"pacify\\" the province. Burmese resistance leader Myat Tun, with 4,000 followers, waged guerrilla warfare, repulsing three British attacks before succumbing to a fourth one led by a brigadier general. In 1857, an ethnic Karen leader began another round of guerrilla warfare in the Irrawaddy delta, and was put down only after 8 years. Question: How many British attacks did Burma withstand?

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does a mirror reflect?\\" is \\"focusing a lens\\", given that  a mirror is used for reflecting visible energy?","output":"In order to answer this question, let's break it down and consider each part of the question and its relationship to the answer provided. Step 1: Understand the question The question is \\"What does a mirror reflect?\\" which is asking what a mirror does to the light or image that falls on its surface.  Step 2: Assess the given answer The given answer is \\"focusing a lens.\\" Focusing a lens is an action performed by a lens, which is a piece of transparent material (usually glass) that refracts light to converge or diverge rays. Lenses are often used to focus or magnify images. Step 3: Consider the definition of a mirror A mirror is a surface, typically made of glass with a reflective coating (such as silver or aluminum), that reflects light in a way that preserves much of its original quality, allowing for a clear and undistorted reflection of the image. Step 4: Compare the given answer to the definition of a mirror \\"Focusing a lens\\" is an action related to lenses rather than mirrors, which are two different optical components with different uses and functionalities. Lenses are responsible for focusing, magnifying, or otherwise altering the path of light, while mirrors reflect light without significant distortion. Step 5: Decide if the given answer is correct Based on the analysis, the given answer \\"focusing a lens\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"what does a mirror reflect?\\" Instead, a better answer would be \\"A mirror reflects visible light, creating a clear and undistorted reflection of the image.\\" So, the right answer to the question \\"What does a mirror reflect?\\" is not \\"focusing a lens\\", as that is an action related to lenses and does not accurately describe the function of a mirror.

Se trata de la única pirámide que conserva el paramento de su entrada intacto: los egiptólogos observaron dos pares de agujeros enfrentados y colocados sobre las paredes laterales este y oeste que debían alojar los goznes de una puerta basculante, que los arquitectos italianos Vito Maragioglio y Celeste Rinaldi suponen de madera. La entrada se abre sobre un pasillo descendente de 78,60 metros con una pendiente de 28°22' los primeros 12,60 m, variando luego a 26°20'. Este corredor tiene la particularidad de estar cubierto con losas dispuestas ligeramente solapadas, de forma escalonada, lo que permite descargar el peso de la parte superior a la manera de una bóveda de cañón por aproximación de las hiladas.[nota 1] El pasaje continúa en otro de 5,40 m sin pendiente, cuyo suelo está a 22,40 m bajo el nivel del terreno, y posee también un techo abovedado similar al anterior pero de 12,60 m de altura.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. pick from the following. 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"1). no; While both questions seem to be closely related, they are not exactly the same. I will provide detailed answers to both questions to help you understand the differences. Question 1: Why are Mexicans considered Native Americans? Mexicans are sometimes considered Native Americans because the majority of Mexico's population is composed of indigenous people who are descendants of the original inhabitants of the Americas. The term \\"Native American\\" broadly refers to the indigenous peoples of North, Central, and South America, including Mexico. Mexico is home to 68 officially recognized indigenous peoples, each with its own language, culture, and history. The indigenous people of Mexico are descendants of pre-Columbian civilizations like the Maya, Aztec, Toltec, and Mixtec, among others. These early civilizations thrived in the region long before the arrival of European colonizers. Mexico has the largest population of indigenous people in the Americas, and because of their deep historical and cultural roots, these diverse indigenous groups are often categorized under the broader term \\"Native Americans.\\" However, it's important to note that the term \\"Native American\\" is more commonly associated with the indigenous peoples of the United States, so using the term \\"indigenous peoples of Mexico\\" may be more accurate in certain contexts. Question 2: Why are Mexican Natives considered Native Americans? Mexican Natives are considered Native Americans for the same reasons mentioned above: they belong to the indigenous populations that originated in the Americas before the arrival of European colonizers. Their heritage and lineage can be traced back to the pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were part of the broader Native American cultural landscape spanning across the continent. However, the primary difference between these two questions lies in the terminology. In Question 1, \\"Mexicans\\" refers to the broader population of Mexico, which includes both indigenous peoples and those with mixed ancestry, whereas in Question 2, \\"Mexican Natives\\" specifically refers to the indigenous peoples of Mexico.  In summary, both questions deal with the connection between the indigenous peoples of Mexico and the larger Native American population throughout the Americas. However, the first question focuses more on the broader Mexican population, while the second question specifically addresses the indigenous peoples of Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what makes a dwarf planet I found the following answer on Google: Makemake (artist's conception) Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer \\"Makemake (artist's conception)\\" is not a correct answer to the question of what makes a dwarf planet. A dwarf planet is a celestial body that orbits the Sun, has enough mass to have a nearly round shape, and has not cleared its orbit of debris. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a celestial body must meet three criteria to be classified as a dwarf planet: 1. It must be in orbit around the Sun. 2. It must have sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape). 3. It has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit (meaning that it does not dominate the other objects in its orbit). Makemake, on the other hand, is an example of a dwarf planet. It was discovered in 2005 and is located in the outer solar system, specifically in the Kuiper Belt. Makemake is the third-largest known dwarf planet in the solar system, after Eris and Pluto. Astronomers classify Makemake as a dwarf planet because it meets the criteria laid out by the IAU. However, the concept of Makemake as an artist's conception refers to a visual representation of what the dwarf planet might look like, not the actual definition of a dwarf planet. In summary, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that meets specific criteria established by the International Astronomical Union. Makemake is an example of a dwarf planet but does not define what makes a celestial body a dwarf planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.  Paragraph: Rob was in the East Coast for a month. He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pub: It was the pub that first introduced the concept of the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the \\"vault\\", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere. By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming. In Germany, what do servers do to serve beer in beer gardens?","output":"In Germany, beer gardens have a different practice when it comes to serving beer. Instead of using a bar counter to serve the beer, servers bring the beer directly to the tables or benches where the customers are seated. This traditional approach creates a more relaxed and communal atmosphere in beer gardens, allowing patrons to enjoy the outdoor setting and engage in conversations with their friends, family, and other visitors. The servers take orders from the customers and fetch the beer from the taproom or storage area before delivering it to the tables. This table service is a distinct feature of German beer gardens, setting them apart from pubs and other drinking establishments where a bar counter is typically used to serve drinks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He wore a green tie on a TV program on October 19, 2011. \\"I just want the students to know that I'm also wearing green. And we are all great people and are as good as those wearing red scarves.\\" The First Experimental Primary School in Xi'an made children with poor schoolwork and behavior wear green scarves. Parents whose children wore green scarves were angry. \\"The children still need their self-esteem   even though they are very young, and they know the green scarf means something is not quite right,\\" said one mother. Now, the school has stopped the practice. Educational expert Li Zhenxi said that primary and junior high school students have strong self-esteem. They are eager to be respected and understood. Punishment will hurt them. \\"It's better to encourage them rather than separating some 'bad' students,\\" he said. A survey made by the Ministry of Education   shows that 75 percent of students feel nervous and scared when the teacher is about to announce their grades. Some schools have done better in protecting students' privacy and encouraging them. In American schools, teachers post test results on the wall.

Down, down, down past shelves and cupboards, mirrors and other curious objects are lined up on shelves. Alice continues to float until she lands and is then in a place called Wonderland. Inside a hall with many different passages, Alice opens a tiny door leading to what she believes is the most beautiful garden she could have ever imagined. In the distance, Alice spots a very curious sort of race, a caucus race, and watches the animals cheer as a small snail defeats the other animals. During her day in Wonderland, Alice questions all of the interesting characters she meets, including the Duchess and her Cheshire Cat about the beautiful garden and how to get there.

The first thing you need to do is to create a function that converts each element in a given list. Step 1: Create a function to determine if a given element is an alphabet. We can do this by creating a helper function called \`is_alpha()\`. This function will return True if the given character is alphabet and False if not. Step 2: Write a function to convert given alphabet to number representative. We can use the built-in \`ord()\` function for this. Lowercase 'a' to 'z' is 97 to 122 and uppercase 'A' to 'Z' is 65 to 90. Therefore, we subtract 96 or 64 according to the ASCII value.  Step 3: Iterate over each element in the list.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON — More than two dozen of the nation’s biggest corporations, including the five major oil companies, are planning their future growth on the expectation that the government will force them to pay a price for carbon pollution as a way to control global warming .      The development is a striking departure from conservative orthodoxy and a reflection of growing divisions between the Republican Party and its business supporters.      A new report by the environmental data company CDP has found that at least 29 companies, some with close ties to Republicans, including Exxon Mobil, Walmart and American Electric Power, are incorporating a price on carbon into their long-term financial plans.      Both supporters and opponents of action to fight global warming say the development is significant because businesses that chart a financial course to make money in a carbon-constrained future could be more inclined to support policies that address climate change.      But unlike the five big oil companies — Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell, all major contributors to the Republican party — Koch Industries, a conglomerate that has played a major role in pushing Republicans away from action on climate change, is ramping up an already-aggressive campaign against climate policy — specifically against any tax or price on carbon. Owned by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, the company includes oil refiners and the paper-goods company Georgia-Pacific.      The divide, between conservative groups that are fighting against government regulation and oil companies that are planning for it as a practical business decision, echoes a deeper rift in the party, as business-friendly establishment Republicans clash with the Tea Party.      Tom Carnac, North American president of CDP, said that the five big oil companies seemed to have determined that a carbon price was an inevitable part of their financial future.      “It’s climate change as a line item,” Mr. Carnac said. “They’re looking at it from a rational perspective, making a profit. It drives internal decision-making.”      Companies do not know what form a future carbon price would take. Congress could one day vote to directly tax emissions. President Obama is moving forward with plans to regulate carbon pollution from coal plants, with or without action from Congress — and states could carry out those regulations by taxing carbon polluters. At climate change talks at the United Nations, State Department negotiators have pledged that the United States will cut its carbon emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 80 percent by 2050.      Mr. Carnac said: “Companies see that the trend is inevitable. What you see here is a hardening of that understanding.”      Other companies that are incorporating a carbon price into their strategic planning include Microsoft, General Electric, Walt Disney, ConAgra Foods, Wells Fargo, DuPont, Duke Energy, Google and Delta Air Lines.      During the 2012 election, every Republican presidential candidate but one, Jon Huntsman, questioned or denied the science of climate change and rejected policies to deal with global warming. Opponents of carbon-pricing policies consider them an energy tax that will hurt business and consumers.      Mainstream economists have long agreed that putting a price on carbon pollution is the most effective way to fight global warming. The idea is fairly simple: if industry must pay to spew the carbon pollution that scientists say is the chief cause of global warming, the costs will be passed on to consumers in higher prices for gasoline and electricity. Those high prices are expected to drive the market away from fossil fuels like oil and coal, and toward low-carbon renewable sources of energy.      Past efforts to enact a carbon price in Washington have failed largely because powerful fossil-fuel groups financed campaigns against lawmakers who supported a carbon tax.      In 1994, dozens of Democratic lawmakers lost their jobs after Al Gore, who was vice president at the time, urged them to vote for a climate change bill that would have effectively taxed carbon pollution. In 2009, President Obama urged House Democrats to vote for a cap-and-trade bill that would have required companies whose carbon-dioxide emissions exceeded set levels to buy emissions rights from those who emitted less. The next year, Tea Party groups spent millions to successfully unseat members who voted for the bill.      But Exxon Mobil, which last year was ranked by the Fortune 500 as the nation’s most profitable company, is representative of Big Oil’s slow evolution on climate change policy. A decade ago, the company was known for contributing to research organizations that questioned the science of climate change. In 2010, Exxon Mobil purchased a company that produces natural gas, which creates less carbon pollution than oil or coal.      Exxon Mobil is now the nation’s biggest natural gas producer, meaning that it will stand to profit in a future in which a price is placed on carbon emissions. Coal, which produces twice the carbon pollution of natural gas, would be a loser. Today, Exxon Mobil openly acknowledges that carbon pollution from fossil fuels contributes to climate change.      “Ultimately, we think the government will take action through a myriad of policies that will raise the prices and reduce demand” of carbon-polluting fossil fuels, said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman.      Internally, Exxon Mobil now plans its financial future with the expectation that eventually carbon pollution will be priced at about 60 a ton, which Mr. Jeffers acknowledged was at odds with some of the company’s Republican friends.      “We’re going to say and do what’s in the best interest of our shareholders,” he said. “We won’t always be on the same page.”      It remains unlikely that any climate policy will move in today’s deadlocked Congress, but if Congress does take up climate change legislation in the future, Mr. Jeffers said Exxon Mobil would support a carbon tax if it was paired with an equal cut elsewhere in the tax code — the same policy that Mr. Gore has endorsed. “Exxon Mobil and many other large companies understand that climate change poses a direct economic threat to their businesses,” said Dan Weiss, director for climate policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group with close ties to the Obama administration. “They need to convince their political allies to act before it’s too late.”      Koch Industries maintains ties to the Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity, which last year campaigned against Republicans who acknowledged the science of climate change. The company also contributes money to the American Energy Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that campaigns against lawmakers that it claims support a carbon price. This year, the American Energy Alliance says it has spent about 1.2 million in ads and campaign activities attacking candidates who it says support a carbon price.      Robert Murphy, senior economist at the American Energy Alliance, said his group was not concerned that it had taken a different position from the major oil companies. “We’re not taking marching orders from Big Oil,” he said.      In fact, Koch has a longtime resentment of the biggest oil companies.      According to company history, Koch’s founder, Fred Koch, the father of Charles and David, invented a chemical process to more efficiently refine oil but was blocked from bringing it to the market by the nation’s largest oil companies, including Standard Oil of New Jersey, which today is known as Exxon Mobil.      People at Koch say sore feelings remain to this day. ||||| WASHINGTON –- Many U.S. companies are already including a price on carbon emissions in their business planning. That includes oil companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, and major coal-burning utilities.      Efforts to put a federal price on carbon stalled out in Congress in 2010. Major polluters deserve most of the credit for tanking that legislation, and for keeping it from coming up again.      But other countries have moved ahead with a putting a price on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and the Environmental Protection Agency has started issuing new regulations on emissions. So, in effect, emitting carbon is starting to get more expensive for all those companies that have been polluting for free for all these years. And the companies recognize it, as the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), a London-based nonprofit that works with corporations to get them to voluntarily disclose their emissions, concluded in a new report issued Thursday.      More than 1,000 companies that operate in North America disclose their emissions to the CDP each year, and the CDP puts that information online and issues reports about trends it sees in those disclosures. This latest report found that at least 29 companies reported that they use a price on carbon internally in their business planning and decisions.      \\"We're not surprised companies are taking a rational, strategic view on climate change and incorporating it into their decision-making process,\\" said Tom Rivett-Carnac, the president of CDP for North America.      Some of the companies that do so might be surprising, however; they include oil companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell. The report also notes utilities such as the St. Louis-based Ameren Corporation, the Southern giant American Electric Power, North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corporation and the Midwest's Xcel Energy.      ExxonMobil reported the highest internal price on carbon, anticipating a cost of 60 per metric ton of carbon by 2030. BP said it is using an assumption of 40 per metric ton of carbon, and ConocoPhillips gave a range of 8 to 46 per ton. Not every company reported an exact figure, but those in the report stated that they do use some number internally.      Exxon posts its assumption on its website. Company spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company is also operating under the assumption that the price will increase to 80 a ton by 2040.      \\"We think that will be the net impact of the various policies that various government's around the world impose in efforts to curb CO2 emissions,\\" Jeffers told The Huffington Post. \\"The risk posed by co2 emission in the environment, raising temperatures, climate change, etc., are motivating governments to take action to put a price on carbon, to try to tackle that issue. We want our planning for that to be as accurate as possible.\\"      Practically speaking, Jeffers said, that figure \\"really does impact some of the fuel choices and our planning assumptions.\\"      This might strike many as unexpected, given that Exxon spent years working to undermine the science on climate change -- leading some to dub it \\"the Michael Jordan of climate change denial.\\" And in 2009, when Congress was considering a cap-and-trade bill, the company came out in favor of a carbon tax and lobbied against the bill that was actually in play. The company's CEO, Rex Tillerson, now acknowledges that climate change is real, but says it's not that bad and humans can adapt.      Jeffers said that the company still prefers a revenue neutral carbon tax, if the U.S. is going to put a set price on carbon emissions. But as the CDP report highlights, whether or not that happens, the company is already anticipating that carbon emissions won't be free for much longer.      Xcel Energy reported a 20 carbon cost assumption in the report, but Jack Ihle, the company's director for environmental and public policy, said that it uses \\"a range of estimated future costs of carbon dioxide emissions\\" in its accounting. Xcel has coal, gas and wind power generation facilities across Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin, and says that it plans to cut its own emissions by 31 percent by 2020. \\"Given the capital-intensive nature of our business, we must make decisions over long-time horizons and take steps today to plan for potential future outcomes, such as climate change regulation,\\" Ihle said in an email. \\"By so doing, we believe we can reduce both the costs and risks associated with potential new environmental mandates.\\"      While the future of greenhouse gas regulation in the U.S. is \\"uncertain\\" at this point, Ihle said, \\"in the long term, we think that either EPA or Congress will likely impose some form of market-based carbon policy on electric generating units.\\"      The disclosure that many companies are already using a price on carbon internally is a marked difference from the doom-and-gloom diagnosis heard most often in Congress. In fact, many companies already think carbon pricing is inevitable.      \\"I think, going beyond the vagaries of party politics, actually companies realize this is coming over the medium- or long-term horizon at least, so they need to plan for it,\\" said CDP's Rivett-Carnac. \\"I think they do a risk assessment and it's all based on probability. Businesses don't operate in a world of certainty; they operate in a world of probabilities. I think they would say, 'We don't know, but we think it's possible.' This is prudent planning in that scenario.\\"       ||||| Summary:","output":"Over two dozen of America's largest corporations, including the five major oil companies, are planning their future growth on the assumption that the government will force them to pay a price for carbon pollution as a way to control global warming.

Before diving into the details of its invention, it is essential to understand the significance of this life-saving device. The three-point seat belt is known for its ability to efficiently distribute the force of a collision across the chest, pelvis, and shoulders of a vehicle's occupants. This distribution minimizes the impact and possible injuries during an accident. Prior to the design of the three-point seat belt, the commonly used two-point seat belt often caused injuries due to its placement across just the waist, focusing all the force on the occupants’ lower body. Volvo was already recognized for focusing on safety in their vehicle designs, and they once again emphasized that commitment when they hired Nils Ivar Bohlin in 1958. Bohlin had previously worked in the aviation industry as an engineer responsible for designing ejection seats for airplanes. His experience in aviation safety engineering proved invaluable as he began working on developing a better type of seat belt for Volvo cars. Bohlin's innovative design consisted of two straps: one extending diagonally across the chest from the shoulder to the opposite hip, and the other stretching horizontally across the waist, both connected to a buckle near the hip. This \\"V\\" shape design not only improved the distribution of impact forces but also held the body more securely in place during a collision, thus significantly reducing the risk of fatal injuries. Volvo introduced the three-point seat belt in their 1959 Volvo PV 544 and then the Volvo Amazon. Recognizing the importance of this invention, Volvo made the patent open-source so that other car manufacturers worldwide could benefit from this design, encouraging more companies to adopt it in their vehicles. The three-point seat belt gradually became a standard safety feature, and by 1970, its use was widely accepted and legally mandated in numerous countries. To summarize, the invention of the three-point seat belt by Nils Ivar Bohlin, a Swedish engineer at Volvo, in 1959 contributed significantly to improving automotive safety and has saved countless lives ever since. The widespread adoption of this technology has undoubtedly made the world a safer place for all who drive or ride in motor vehicles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact \\"long ears are used for releasing heat by a jackrabbit\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Jackrabbits excel at staying cool because of\\" Choices:  * their adaptations;  * a courthouse;  * a frozen tundra;  * an ocean;","output":"Jackrabbits excel at staying cool because of their adaptations.  Jackrabbits, also known as hares, are well-adapted to their harsh environments. They are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the deserts and prairies of North America, where temperatures can soar during the daytime. To survive these extreme temperatures, jackrabbits have developed several adaptations that allow them to regulate their body temperature effectively and maintain their overall well-being. One of the most notable adaptations is their long ears. Jackrabbit ears are significantly longer than those of their relatives, like rabbits, and can measure up to 8 inches in length. The large surface area of the ears allows for an efficient release of heat through a process called vasodilation. Vasodilation is the widening of blood vessels, which helps regulate body temperature by permitting blood flow near the surface of the skin to increase, allowing excess heat to dissipate. The jackrabbit's ears contain numerous blood vessels that expand or contract, depending on the animal's need to retain or release heat. Moreover, the thin skin and sparse fur on the ears contribute to the rapid transfer of heat from the jackrabbit's body to the environment. When the temperature rises, the heat from the body travels into the ears and radiates off more easily. Conversely, if the jackrabbit needs to conserve heat during colder temperatures, the blood vessels in the ears constrict, reducing blood flow and conserving warmer blood in the core of its body. Apart from their unique ears, jackrabbits have developed other adaptations to cope with high temperatures. Their light-colored fur helps reflect sunlight instead of absorbing it, which reduces the overall amount of heat their bodies absorb. Additionally, they are crepuscular and nocturnal creatures, meaning they are most active during the early morning, late evening, and night. By minimizing their activity during the heat of the day, jackrabbits reduce the amount of energy they use and the excess heat their bodies generate through movement. Another interesting adaptation is their ability to conserve water. Jackrabbits consume moisture-rich vegetation and obtain most of the water they need from their diets. They also have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract and conserve water more efficiently than other species. In conclusion, jackrabbits have several adaptations that enable them to stay cool in high temperatures, primarily their large, well-vascularized ears that facilitate effective heat dissipation. Along with some of these other key adaptations, such as their light-colored fur, crepuscular and nocturnal lifestyle, and water conservation techniques, jackrabbits can thrive in challenging environments that would be inhospitable to many other species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, perform the song relying solely on your memory and muscle memory. Doing so will consolidate your learning and ensure you have a deep understanding of the piece. At this stage, if you can play the song smoothly on your guitar while singing the entire lyrics without reference, congratulations! You have successfully mastered the song. Conclusion Mastering any song on guitar and vocals requires patience, perseverance, and a strategic approach to your learning. By following this step-by-step guide, which involves selecting a suitable song, memorizing the lyrics and guitar components, combining the two, and practicing with or without the original recording, you will be well-equipped to tackle songs in the future. Ultimately, this journey of musical development will contribute to your growth as a well-rounded musician, ready to share your passion for the art with others."},{"instruction":"The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Currently, U.S. dollar banknotes are issued in seven denominations, which include 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. These facts imply that there is no 1,000 bill currently in circulation, as it would exceed the maximum denomination of 100 that has been produced since 1969.  While it is worth noting that a 1,000 bill did exist in the past, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has not been authorized to print it or any other denomination higher than 100 for circulation in the United States since 1969. This decision was made primarily due to the increased use of checks and electronic payment systems, rendering the need for larger denomination banknotes unnecessary. Additionally, removing higher denomination bills from circulation limited opportunities for illegal activities that required large cash transactions, such as money laundering or tax evasion. In summary, based on the provided text, the best answer to the question regarding the existence of a 1,000 bill in circulation is that there is not one currently being produced or circulated by the United States Treasury. Instead, the U.S. has chosen to issue dollar banknotes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 since 1969, being mindful of the potential implications and risks posed by larger denomination bills."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Available options: [1]. smallest; [2]. finest; [3]. lightest; [4]. largest; The answer is:","output":"[4]. largest; When water slows down, it loses its ability to carry as much material — a property known as its carrying capacity. Sediment in water usually consists of a mixture of many different sizes of particles. These can range from tiny, finely grained particles to larger gravel or even boulder-sized pieces.  To fully understand how the sediment is deposited, we need to understand how the sediments are transported. These modes include suspension, saltation and traction. 1. Suspension: This is when small particles are carried along with the water, like silt or clay. They are too small to touch the bottom and because their mass is so small, current or the speed of water can keep them aloft. 2. Saltation: This occurs with medium-sized particles like fine sand and gravel which temporarily get lifted off the stream bed by the current before they settle back down. They 'hop' or 'leap' along the bottom. 3. Traction: Larger and heavier particles like pebbles, cobbles, and boulders roll, slide or drag along the streambed, known as traction. When water slows down, it doesn't have enough energy to transport sediment in the same ways. This means it begins to deposit the sediment it's carrying. The first particles to be deposited are the largest ones. These are the particles that the water was moving through traction. This is because they are the heaviest and require the most energy to move. As the water continues to slow down, it will then start to deposit smaller particles that had been moving via saltation.  Eventually, if the water becomes still, even the smallest particles that were suspended in the water column will drop out and settle at the bottom. This is why, over time, you can often see different layers in sediment deposits representing different grain sizes. So to summarize, when water slows down, it starts depositing sediment with the largest particles first due to the progressive decrease in energy or velocity of the water. Smaller grains or particles settle out only when the water is nearly still, hence forming fine-grained sedimentary layers. This whole process is also known under the term \\"graded bedding\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

First, let's break down the meaning of each sentence: 1. \\"Cardiff Castle was initially held by Philip Herbert, a moderate Parliamentarian, and the castle was then owned by a pro-Royalist garrison.\\" - In this sentence, the focus is on the order of events. Cardiff Castle was first held by Philip Herbert, who was a moderate Parliamentarian. After Philip Herbert, the castle was owned by a pro-Royalist garrison. 2. \\"Cardiff Castle was owned at the time by Philip Herbert, a moderate parliamentarian, and the castle was initially held by a pro-royalist garrison.\\" - This sentence paints a slightly different picture. It emphasizes that Cardiff Castle's ownership during a specific period was in the hands of Philip Herbert, a moderate Parliamentarian. Additionally, the castle was initially held by a pro-Royalist garrison. This phrasing does not explicitly state whether the pro-Royalist garrison gave control to Philip Herbert or if this was beforehand. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the order of events and the focus on Philip Herbert or the pro-Royalist garrison. In the first sentence, the emphasis is on Philip Herbert's initial control of the castle, followed by the ownership of the pro-Royalist garrison. In contrast, the second sentence emphasizes Philip Herbert's ownership at a particular time, mentioning the pro-Royalist garrison having held the castle initially without directly linking the two events. In summary, while these two sentences discuss the same entities (Cardiff Castle, Philip Herbert, and a pro-Royalist garrison), they present different perspectives and do not necessarily convey the same exact meaning. The first sentence is clearer about the sequence of events – Philip Herbert holding the castle at first, followed by the pro-Royalist garrison owning it. In contrast, the second sentence is less explicit about the order between Herbert's ownership and the pro-Royalist garrison's past control over the castle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...what are the various planned maintenance schedules that are generally used??","output":"Planned maintenance schedules are pre-determined programs designed to manage, inspect, and maintain equipment and systems within a facility. The goal of these schedules is to improve efficiency, prolong equipment life, reduce downtime, and ensure that facilities operate smoothly and safely. Various types of planned maintenance schedules are employed depending on the requirements of the organization and the equipment involved. Here is a comprehensive list of the most widely used maintenance schedules: 1. Routine maintenance: This schedule involves performing regular maintenance tasks to ensure smooth operation. It includes minor adjustments and repairs, lubrication, cleaning, and visual inspections. Routine maintenance usually takes place on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the needs of the equipment and facility. 2. Preventive maintenance: As the name suggests, preventive maintenance is the process of performing regular inspections and maintenance tasks to prevent breakdowns or failures before they happen. This can involve replacing worn or damaged parts, tightening bolts, updating software or firmware, and calibrating instruments. Preventive maintenance is often based on a set schedule or triggered by equipment usage or specific time intervals. 3. Predictive maintenance: This type of maintenance schedule employs advanced tools, techniques, and technologies to monitor equipment in real-time, identifying trends and patterns that suggest potential for failure. Predictive maintenance can help maintenance teams take corrective action before a failure occurs, reducing downtime, minimizing costs, and improving system reliability. This approach often uses sensors, machine learning, and data analysis to predict when maintenance is needed. 4. Time-based maintenance: Time-based maintenance is a schedule where tasks are carried out at fixed intervals, independent of the equipment's condition. This type of maintenance can be calendar-based or usage-based and includes activities such as changing filters, replacing gaskets, or adjusting tension belts. Time-based maintenance is a common approach when the failure pattern of the equipment is time-sensitive. 5. Usage-based maintenance: Usage-based maintenance schedules are developed around the actual utilization of the equipment. This type of maintenance takes into account the number of operating hours, cycles, or production volume to determine the right time for maintenance. Usage-based maintenance helps to align maintenance activities with equipment wear and tear more accurately. 6. Condition-based maintenance: This approach focuses on the actual condition of the equipment to determine when maintenance is required. Maintenance teams monitor and measure variables like vibration, temperature, pressure, and noise to assess the condition of the equipment and decide when intervention is necessary. Condition-based maintenance ensures that tasks are only performed when needed, reducing unnecessary maintenance and costs. 7. Reliability-centered maintenance: Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is an advanced methodology that evaluates the reliability of equipment and systems by analyzing their functions, failures, and consequences. Based on this analysis, an optimal maintenance plan is developed, combining preventive, predictive, and condition-based techniques. RCM aims to optimize maintenance resources, extend equipment life, and improve reliability. 8. Total productive maintenance: Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a comprehensive maintenance strategy that involves the entire organization, from top management to floor workers. TPM focuses on improving equipment effectiveness and reliability by emphasizing proactive maintenance, continuous improvement, and employee involvement. This holistic approach reduces downtime, improves quality, and increases productivity. 9. Risk-based maintenance: Risk-based maintenance analyzes the potential risk associated with equipment failure to determine appropriate maintenance strategies. By evaluating the probability and consequences of failure, maintenance activities can be prioritized and resources can be allocated efficiently. This approach helps to minimize risks to equipment, operators, and facilities, and aids in compliance with safety and environmental regulations. In conclusion, various planned maintenance schedules are employed depending on the organization's specific needs, the type of equipment or systems involved, and the overall objectives for efficiency, reliability, and safety. Implementing an appropriate maintenance plan can significantly enhance the performance and lifespan of equipment, reduce downtime, and ensure smooth, safe operation of facilities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Theodore Honey, an eccentric \\"boffin\\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth, Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder both take a liking to Mr. Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the given context, it is Theodore Honey who decides to give a warning to the Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale. This decision stems from Honey's concern for the safety of the passengers on board the Rutland Reindeer airliner, including Teasdale. Theodore Honey is an eccentric scientist working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, who is deeply invested in finding the cause of a recent Rutland Reindeer airliner crash in Labrador, Canada. He believes that the crash occurred due to the tailplane's structural failure, caused by metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. As a part of his investigation, Honey finds himself on a Reindeer airliner which, to his concern, is an early production aircraft that is close to reaching the threshold flight hours he believes will cause metal fatigue failure. Despite his theory not being proven yet, Honey feels compelled to warn the aircrew and Monica Teasdale, a fellow passenger, about the potential danger they are facing. After the aircraft safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to proceed. Honey, however, remains unconvinced and takes drastic measures to prevent the aircraft from continuing by damaging it. This action raises questions about his sanity among his colleagues who want to preserve the reputation of British passenger aviation. Throughout these events, Monica Teasdale and the airline stewardess Marjorie Corder become connected with Honey and his daughter Elspeth. Teasdale, in particular, believes in Honey's theory, and as a result, she speaks on his behalf to his superiors. Both Teasdale and Corder grow close to Honey and his daughter, eventually leading to Honey marrying Corder, who has seen the many qualities beyond his eccentricities. In conclusion, Theodore Honey, prompted by his aviation crash investigation and concern for passenger safety, makes the decision to warn Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale about the potential danger they face on their flight. This warning leads to a series of events that further intertwines the lives of Honey, Teasdale, Corder, and Elspeth, and ultimately results in Honey's personal and professional redemption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The higher the pH value, the more strongly basic the substance.  Answer the question:   If Mona is filling her pool with chemicals to change the pH level of the water and she decreases the pH, what happens to the baseness of the water increase or decrease? A:","output":"If Mona is filling her pool with chemicals to change the pH level of the water and she decreases the pH, the baseness of the water will decrease. To better understand this, it's important to recall the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is considered neutral, with values below 7 being acidic and values above 7 being basic or alkaline. The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, which means that the difference between pH values represents a tenfold change in acidity or alkalinity. For example, a substance with a pH of 5 is ten times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 6 and a hundred times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 7. Now, going back to the scenario with Mona filling her pool with chemicals, when she decreases the pH of the water, this means that she is making the water more acidic and consequently less basic. Lowering the pH of the water means that the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is increasing, while the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) is decreasing in the water. This shift in the balance of ions leads to a reduction in the baseness of the water. In summary, as Mona decreases the pH level of the pool water, the baseness of the water will decrease, and the water becomes more acidic. It is essential for Mona to carefully monitor and adjust the pH levels in her pool to maintain the ideal pH range, which is typically between 7.2 and 7.8. This optimal pH range ensures that the pool water is comfortable for swimmers, provides proper sanitization, and prevents potential damage to the pool and its equipment due to highly acidic or alkaline conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random. Q: Concept: flute, Relatum: object.

She resides with her working-class parents, Herbert and Honora (Simon O'Connor and Sarah Peirse), whose home doubles as a boarding house. Introverted Pauline sleeps in a small furnished hut in the yard.Pauline's life changes dramatically when she befriends wealthy British transfer student Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), the daughter of a respected physicist. Pauline's quiet nature is countered by Juliet's charisma and outspokenness, and the girls quickly become inseparable. Juliet is unafraid of authority, impressing Pauline by fearlessly correcting their French teacher during class and by ignoring their art teacher's instructions altogether.They are also the only two girls in their class forbidden from taking part in gym activities, due to childhood battles with bone disease, on Pauline's part, and lung disease on Juliet's. They spend this class period bonding over their passions for music, art, film, and literature. They share a particular fondness for the music of popular tenor Mario Lanza, and for the actor James Mason.Pauline is invited to visit Juliet at the Hulme home, a stately mansion on a sprawling property of woods and creeks. Juliet and her younger brother Jonathan (Ben Skjellerup) often dress up and play fantasy games in the fairy tale-like setting.

It was not that Joseph disliked the team or the game, but rather, it just so happened that Logan, being a naturally loquacious person, had a tendency to repeat himself. Joseph's patience was wearing thin when he finally heard one too many iterations of the same factoid appreciating certain players' skill set. Step 1: Assess the situation. Joseph decided that a gentle, but firm, reminder was needed to remind Logan that he could enjoy the game in silence if he so wished.  Step 2: Choose a method to communicate. Frustrated and running out of diplomatic ways to convey his feelings, Joseph impulsively decided to resort to a more impactful method that would demand Logan's attention. Step 3: Execute the action. Joseph took the piece of chewed gum from his mouth, aimed carefully, and, with an artful flick of his fingers, sent it flying towards Logan. Step 4: Observe the results. The gum hit Logan squarely in the cheek, momentarily stunning him into silence.  Step 5: Evaluate the consequences. At first, Logan was visibly upset, mortified that his excitement had provoked such an intense reaction from his dear friend. Upon taking a deep breath, however, he acknowledged that perhaps his excessive fervor might not always be appreciated by those around him. Step 6: Apologize and make amends. Regretting his instinctive and inconsiderate reaction, Joseph apologized for his temerarious gum flinging and reassured Logan that it was simply an ill-advised tactic to gain his attention, not an act of malice. Step 7: Rebuild communication. With the air now clear between them, the two friends resumed watching the game in a more companionable silence, only occasionally interrupting the hush with comments that were mutually appreciated. Step 8: Learn from the experience. Both Joseph and Logan were able to take away valuable lessons from their little spat at the ball game, reinforcing the importance of open communication, understanding, and respect in maintaining a thriving friendship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This camp screwball comedy of errors, that includes many over-the-top stereotypes, is set at Halloween against the backdrop of West Hollywood, California. Five friends, interior designer Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); African American stockbroker Dave (played by Meadows); Latino spinning instructor Fredrico (played by Sabàto); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion — that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the WeHo sheriff's station with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble. Dave goes to East L.A., where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by Díaz). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his Porsche in exchange for his lowrider gang car. A case of mistaken identity makes a vengeful, rival gang get after them. There is a comic drive-by shooting scene. Also, by driving Romeo's lowrider they are unknowingly carrying an illegal cache of weapons.","output":"Evan and Harvey have come up with a food-themed sushi costume that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Carnatic Wars were a series of conflicts in the 18th century between the British East India Company and French East India Company, along with their Indian allies, primarily over the control of the Carnatic region in southern India.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.\\"The opening theme is repeated throughout. The...

Context: Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence). Answer:","output":"To answer the question, we need to determine which country was established first: Great Britain or the United States of America. From the context given, we can infer the following information: 1. The Thirteen Colonies of North America were originally governed by the Parliament of Great Britain. 2. The American Revolution took place in the latter half of the 18th century, leading to the Thirteen Colonies rejecting British governance and monarchy. 3. The Second Continental Congress defended the self-governance of the colonies in the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783. 4. The colonies eventually formed the sovereign United States of America.

While the paragraph does not explicitly state that it is the Yemen branch, it can be inferred from the context. The paragraph mentions that an official of Abyan police, presumably in Yemen since the text discusses Yemen in connection with the Western tourists and the hostages, communicated that the hostages are being held by the Yemeni \\"Islamic Jihad\\" group. The fact that the hostages are held by this group implies that the group was likely involved in their kidnapping. Furthermore, when referring to the group holding the hostages, the paragraph clarifies that it is the Yemeni \\"Islamic Jihad,\\" which indicates that it is, in fact, the Yemen branch of the group.  Additionally, the group's demands involve the release of its leader and lifting the embargo on Iraq, which suggests that the Yemeni \\"Islamic Jihad\\" group has political motivations for kidnapping the tourists which is consistent with being an active branch. Taking these points into account, we can infer that the Yemen branch of the \\"Islamic Jihad\\" group is responsible for kidnapping the 16 Western tourists, making the sentence true (option (i))."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","output":"First, let's start with the initial equation: 32*v - 642*v = 159*v + 67672 To solve this equation for v, we need to combine the terms with v on both sides of the equation. We can do this by adding 642 * v to both sides: (32*v - 642*v) + 642*v = 159*v + 67672 + 642*v Which simplifies to: 32*v = 801*v + 67672 Next, to isolate the variable v, we will subtract 801*v from both sides: 32*v - 801*v = 801*v - 801*v + 67672 This simplifies to: -769*v = 67672 Now, to find the value of v, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -769: (-769*v) / -769 = 67672 / -769 This simplifies to: v ≈ -88 Thus, the solution to the given equation is approximately: v ≈ -88"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The game is organized into three separate rounds, with six hands played during each round. During the first round, players must adhere to specific betting limits: the minimum bet is set at 10 per hand, while the maximum ceiling for betting is capped at 250 per hand. It is important for players to strategize and manage their bankroll effectively in order to maximize their bets and keep their game momentum going throughout all three rounds. Through calculated risk-taking and attention to the other players' actions, individuals can make informed decisions when betting within the defined limits. As the game advances into the second and third rounds, players may experience shifts in their strategy. This could be due to previous round outcomes, changes in their opponents' behavior, or simply a desire to adapt their betting approach to secure a winning position. It is crucial for players to maintain focus and be agile in their decision-making in order to respond to a dynamic game environment. Throughout the course of the game, players will need to exercise a combination of skill, intuition, and flexibility in order to achieve victory. By managing their bets effectively, closely observing the gameplay, and adapting their tactics accordingly, participants can optimize their chances of success and potentially outlast the competition.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the official name of the act helped push through parliament by the man that who introduced Tom Nero?  In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of \\"No hero\\". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene: The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's intestines spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Saint Hilarius of Aquileia was a notable figure in the Roman Catholic Church, whose life is commemorated for his contributions as a bishop and martyr. He has been venerated throughout the centuries for his service to the church and is celebrated annually on his feast day, which falls on March 16. Born in an unknown year, Saint Hilarius lived during the later part of the third century AD and is believed to have passed away around 284 AD. Not much is known about his early life and upbringing, but it is clear that he dedicated his life to the cause of Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church. Hilarius rose through the ranks of the church and eventually became the bishop of Aquileia, a prominent city in northeastern Italy known for its significant role in the early Christian community. As the bishop of Aquileia, Saint Hilarius was responsible for leading the local congregation, providing pastoral care, and ensuring the preservation and promotion of the church's teachings and doctrines. In the context of the Roman Empire, the early Christian church faced considerable challenges and persecution. Saint Hilarius, as a leader of the church, bore the brunt of this persecution in his capacity as bishop. Standing firmly in defense of his faith and beliefs, he ultimately met a tragic end, becoming a martyr for the Christian cause. Though the circumstances around his martyrdom are not explicitly detailed in historical accounts, the fact that he paid the ultimate price for his commitment to the faith is evidence of his unwavering dedication. This self-sacrifice led to Saint Hilarius being regarded as a martyr by the Roman Catholic Church, solidifying his status as a saint in the eyes of believers. Today, Saint Hilarius of Aquileia continues to be revered in the Roman Catholic Church, with his feast day serving as a time for the faithful to remember and celebrate his life of service, devotion, and ultimate sacrifice for the Christian faith. His legacy stands as an inspiration to the countless believers who follow in his footsteps, imbuing them with the spirit of perseverance and unwavering devotion to their beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the first name of the person who remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work  Answer the above question based on the context below:  William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Here I am going to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks, which I personally consider are among the most interesting of antiques.

Men can do nothing without its permission, and it fastens its young round people's wrists so that everywhere men go they are still under its control. This creature is the real master of Earth and men are its slaves .\\" Whether or not we are slaves of time today depends on our culture and personality, but it is believed that many years ago kings kept special slaves to tell the time.

So it seems that the first clocks were human beings. However, men quickly found more convenient and reliable  ways of telling the time. They learned to use the shadows cast by the sun.

Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean. Question: According to the passage, what will scientists most probably do in the future? Answer: The answer is:","output":"In the future, scientists will most probably undertake more research to better understand the impact of noise pollution on ocean animals and determine the types and levels of noises that are harmful to them. Considering the increasing threat posed by noise pollution caused by human activities, scientists may also work towards establishing effective noise limits in the oceans to protect marine life. This might involve finding a balance between preserving important industrial and scientific research and preventing harm to ocean creatures. Furthermore, scientists will likely develop strategies and recommendations for mitigating and controlling noise pollution in the ocean, which could entail raising awareness, adopting quieter technologies, and implementing regulations and monitoring programs to ensure the wellbeing of marine animals."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the English and Hindi language.

Here is a goal: how do I prep cupcake pans How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"Preparing cupcake pans involves a series of straightforward steps. It's crucial to prep your cupcake pans properly to ensure easy removal of the cupcakes after baking and to prevent cupcakes from sticking to the pan, potentially ruining their shape and texture.  Here's a detailed, step-by-step process to help achieve this: 1. **Materials Gathered**: Firstly, make sure you've gathered all the things you'll need. This includes the cupcake pan, cupcake liners, non-stick cooking spray (if you choose to use it), a spoon or ice cream scoop, and of course, your cupcake batter. 2. **Choose the Right Pan Size**: Cupcake pans come in standard and mini sizes. Ensure you select the right size for your recipe. If the recipe doesn't specify, a standard size is a safe bet. 3. **Use Cupcake Liners**: Cupcake liners, also known as baking cups or muffin papers, are really easy to use. You simply push them into the holes in the cake pan. Ensure they are fit snugly into the spaces. Liners not only give your cupcakes a neat and uniform shape, but they also make it extremely easy to remove the cupcakes from the pan after baking. Plus, they reduce the amount of cleanup you'll have to do afterwards. 4. **Apply Non-stick Spray (Optional)**: If you don't have cupcake liners at hand, you can use a non-stick cooking spray to grease the cupcake pans. Alternatively, you can use a little bit of butter or oil. Make sure to cover the bottom and the sides of each cup. This will prevent the cupcake batter from sticking to the pan. Over-greasing should be avoided as it can cause the cupcakes to have greasy bottoms. 5. **Preheat Oven**: While you're prepping your cupcake pans, remember to preheat your oven. The specific temperature will depend on your recipe, but 350°F (175°C) is a common baking temperature for cupcakes. Preheating helps ensure that your cupcakes will bake evenly. 6. **Fill the Liners with Batter**: Using a spoon or an ice-cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner or greased cup with batter. You'll typically want to fill each about 2/3 of the way full. This gives the batter enough room to rise without overflowing during baking. 7. **Tap The Pan**: Once you have filled your cupcake liners or cups, you can tap the pan lightly on the counter. This helps to get rid of any air bubbles in the batter and to make sure the batter fills the bottom of each liner completely. 8. **Bake and Cool**: Now you're ready to bake according to your recipe's instructions. Once the cupcakes are done, let them cool in the pan for at least five minutes before removing. This process makes removing the cupcakes from the pan easier and prevents them from falling apart. 9. **Removing the Cupcakes**: After the cupcakes have cooled for a bit, take them out of the cupcake pan. If you used cupcake liners, this step is as simple as lifting them out. If you didn't use cupcake liners, you might need to gently run a butter knife around the edge of each cup before lifting them out. That's it! With those careful preparations, you're fully equipped to bake your cupcakes with a breeze and enjoy them while preserving their delicious flavours and wonderful shapes!"},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it appears that Tracy and Jan were engaged in a game of cards when Tracy forced Jan to reveal their hand. In such a situation, multiple factors may influence Jan's next move; however, one can make some educated predictions considering a generic card game setup. 1. Feelings or emotions: Jan may feel disappointed or frustrated at having been forced to reveal their hand. They may also feel a sense of betrayal if Tracy is a friend or ally in the game. Consequently, Jan might focus on managing their emotions to avoid making impulsive decisions in the game. 2. Analyzing Tracy's motives: Jan may try to figure out why Tracy forced them to reveal their hand. Was Tracy trying to gain information, undermine Jan's strategy, or use this opportunity as a psychological warfare tactic? Understanding Tracy's motives will provide Jan with valuable insights that they can use to customize their subsequent moves and interactions with Tracy. 3. Adapting strategy: With their hand exposed, Jan will need to modify or devise an entirely new game strategy. They could use this chance to reassess their initial approach, exploit any potential weaknesses in Tracy's play, or collaborate with other players to counteract Tracy's actions. 4. Bluffing or diversions: Jan might choose to bluff or create a diversion to minimize the impact of showing their hand. They could pretend to be unconcerned, act as if they possess a stronger hand than they do or engage in conversation to distract Tracy and the other players from scrutinizing their cards. 5. Seeking information: To level the playing field, Jan could attempt to gather information about other players' hands, including Tracy's. This can be achieved through observing players' body language, facial expressions, and conversations, analyzing patterns of play, or using specific card game strategies designed to reveal information about opponents' hands. 6. Focusing on long-term play: Rather than dwelling on the setback of showing their hand, Jan can focus on long-term strategies and the overall goal of the card game. They should maintain a sense of perspective and not let this one event dictate the entire course of the game. Concentrating on specific objectives or milestones can help Jan move past this incident and rediscover their motivation to win. 7. Reflection and learning: Lastly, Jan can use this experience as a learning opportunity, analyzing how Tracy managed to force them into revealing their hand and how they could prevent similar situations in future games. This reflection will help Jan grow as a card player and develop essential skills for handling different situations and opponents. In conclusion, Jan's next move after being forced to reveal their hand will depend on several factors such as managing emotions, understanding opponents' motives, adapting their strategy, and focusing on long-term goals. By incorporating these elements, Jan will be better equipped to recover from this setback and continue playing the card game effectively."},{"instruction":"Threatening behavior by predators causes a porcupine to extend its quills, and porcupines are in the rodent family.

Now, to get the value of q, we will divide both sides of the equation by -35. -35q / -35 = 630 / -35 q = -18 So the solution to the equation -35*q - 243 - 237 - 181 = -31 is q = -18."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten.

Question: Given the fact that:  Plug-in hybrids run for a longer time on electricity and so are less polluting than regular hybrids.  Answer the question:   Would a diesel powered submarine release less pollution if it were running on its diesel engine or its battery backup power?? Answer:","output":"A diesel-powered submarine would release less pollution when running on its battery backup power as compared to running on its diesel engine. This can be explained by examining the differences between the two power sources and their potential environmental impacts. 1. Diesel Engine: When a submarine operates on its diesel engine, it burns diesel fuel to generate the necessary power. The combustion process of diesel fuel produces various pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM). These emissions contribute to air pollution, climate change, and health issues. Diesel engines are also inherently less efficient than electric motors, leading to higher fuel consumption and, consequently, increased emissions. 2. Battery Backup Power: Submarines equipped with battery backup systems store electrical energy in batteries, which is then used to power the electric motor when the diesel engine is not in use or when the submarine needs to operate silently. While running on battery power, the submarine does not produce any direct exhaust emissions since there is no combustion taking place. It is worth mentioning that the environmental impact of a battery-powered submarine depends on the source of the electricity used to charge the batteries. The electricity could come from a variety of sources, such as fossil fuels (coal, natural gas), nuclear power, or renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro). The environmental impact of these sources varies significantly, with renewables having the lowest carbon footprint. However, even when considering emissions related to electricity production, running on battery backup power generally results in lower emissions compared to using diesel engines. It is important to note that the battery production process also has an environmental impact. Battery production involves the extraction and processing of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt, which can lead to habitat destruction, water pollution, and other ecological consequences. Battery disposal and recycling also pose environmental challenges. Despite these factors, the overall emissions produced during the use of battery backup power remains lower than when operating on diesel engines. In conclusion, a diesel-powered submarine releases less pollution when running on its battery backup power compared to operating on its diesel engine. While both battery production and electricity generation have their environmental implications, the absence of direct exhaust emissions and the potential to use cleaner sources of electricity make battery backup power a less polluting option for submarines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Report the number of casualties, and include a personal story from a victim's family member. City officials have confirmed that at least three people were killed in the blast, with nine others still missing. A woman told CNN that her aunt was among those who lost their lives in the tragic incident. Families and loved ones are anxiously awaiting any news on the safety of those who remain unaccounted for, with emergency services working around the clock to locate and rescue survivors. Step 3: Discuss the challenges faced by search and rescue teams due to the sinkhole. The search and rescue efforts have been further complicated by a large sinkhole which opened up in front of the collapsed buildings. The unstable ground has presented a significant obstacle for emergency crews, as they must proceed cautiously to avoid further damage to the surrounding area or harm to individuals still trapped beneath the rubble. Step 4: Emphasize the ongoing efforts of emergency services. Despite the challenges posed by the sinkhole and unstable building remnants, emergency services, including firefighters, paramedics, and police, are working diligently to find those who are still missing. Crews are using specialized equipment and trained sniffer dogs to help detect signs of life amid the wreckage. Conclusion: As the search for survivors continues, city officials and emergency services are appealing to the community for support and assistance. The people of [CITYNAME] have come together to offer aid, with many volunteering to support those impacted by this devastating event. The tragic loss of life and the ongoing recovery efforts serve as a stark reminder of the power of community resilience in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The man loved to fish bass, to be happy all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a what?

The group was active throughout the 1980s and responsible for reviving the blues, inspiring many later blues and rock musicians. Formed in Austin, Texas, by 1985 the group consisted of Vaughan, Chris Layton (drums), Tommy Shannon (bass), and eventually Reese Wynans (keyboards). While with Vaughan the band was billed Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. The band's desire to experiment grew as they recorded Soul to Soul, beginning in March 1985. Vaughan recalled using two wah-wah pedals for \\"Say What!\\", sitting on a stool and working them separately. Parts of the album featured work by Joe Sublett, Doyle Bramhall and Reese Wynans, who was hired as the band's keyboardist. The group's cocaine use increased however, especially Vaughan's, as witnessed by Bramhall, who recalled seeing \\"mounds of cocaine on top of the organ\\". He said of Vaughan's cocaine use: \\"Where I was doing a lot, Stevie was doing five times, ten times more than I was doing.\\" Nearly 800 minutes of the studio recordings were devoted to the sessions and leaked into the collector's market. Released in September, Soul to Soul received mixed reviews from critics. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented, \\"For all of its positive attributes, Soul to Soul winds up being less than the sum of its parts, and it's hard to pinpoint an exact reason why. Perhaps it was because Vaughan was on the verge of a horrible battle with substance abuse at the time of recording or perhaps it just has that unevenness inherent in transitional albums.\\"  In July 1986, the band recorded three shows in Austin and Dallas for a live album, later released as Live Alive. One month later, Vaughan learned that his father was hospitalized for an illness, and flew to his hometown of Dallas to be with his family; he died three days later from complications associated with asbestos. After attending his funeral, Vaughan immediately flew to Montreal for a performance in Jarry Park, which was reportedly the highest paying show for the band at the time. A fan recalls the Montreal concert: \\"He played for a solid two hours and never said a word to the crowd until he came back for an encore and said, 'This one's for you, daddy.' I was in the front row that night, and many times during the set he was crying while playing. I will never forget that performance.\\"  During a tour of Europe a month later, Vaughan was hospitalized in Ludwigshafen for near-death dehydration from years of alcohol and substance abuse. After two weeks of treatment in London, he checked into Peachford Hospital in Atlanta and spent a month in rehabilitation, emerging fully recovered and healthy; he would often attend local Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on tour. Vaughan rejoined with Double Trouble to tour in support of Live Alive for the next two years, visiting countries such as England, Italy, and Germany. The band also performed at the inaugural party for President George H. W. Bush in Washington, D.C. Did he play Soul to Soul?","output":"Based on the information provided, it does not specifically mention whether Stevie Ray Vaughan played \\"Soul to Soul\\" during the concerts or tours. However, since \\"Soul to Soul\\" was an album released in September 1985 and the band continued to tour and perform through the mid-to-late 1980s, it is possible that they played songs from the \\"Soul to Soul\\" album during their concerts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was 1:30 a.m. Monday at London's Savoy Hotel and, with autograph books and cameras, a group of brighteyed tennis fans of all ages were waiting for just a glimpse of Maria Sharapova .     The 17-year-old girl defeated champion Serena Williams  6-1 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Saturday in London to become the first Russian to win a single title at the championships.     A silver lining to a depressing, rain-hit Wimbledon, she has raised heated passion.     Nobody was complaining, though, for the 1.83-metre Sharapova has created a welcome wave of interest in tennis, something missing in recent years.     Not even Anna Kournikova evoked  such passion when she broke on to the scene. To look good on court is one thing, but Sharapova can actually play the game too. Extremely well.     She proved it over 13 days at the world's most prestigious tournament. Playing tennis of the highest quality throughout, the Russian's triumph not only lifted the tournament from fits of rain-induced depression but also salvaged(;) the season for the woman's tour.      Sharapova was given no easy ride in the tournament, having to beat 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals and twice-champion Serena Williams for the title. Neither caused her much concern.     \\"I don't remember too much about the final,\\" Sharapova giggled. \\"I was in my own place.\\"     She will find it increasingly hard to find any place to call her own from now on after advertisers identified her as the most marketable woman in sport.     In Russia she is sensational news. She headlined the news bulletins and was telephoned by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin after her triumph.    Sharapova will return to her adoptive Florida home knowing life will never be the same again.     But the girl who arrived in the US aged seven with her father and just US700 is determined not to let fame and riches detract from her number one love, tennis.     \\"I know things will start coming up and that many more things will want to get involved, but I want to keep my...

The Confederation of African Football (CAF, ; ; ) is the administrative and controlling body for African association football.  CAF represents the national football associations of Africa, runs continental, national, and club competitions, and controls the prize money, regulations and media rights to those competitions.  CAF is the biggest of the six continental confederations of FIFA. Since the expansion of the number of teams at the World Cup finals to 32 in 1998, CAF has been allocated five places, though this was expanded to six for the 2010 tournament in South Africa, to include the hosts.  CAF was founded on 8 February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, by the Egyptian, Ethiopian, South African and Sudanese FAs, following former discussions between the Egyptian, Somali, South African and Sudanese FAs earlier on 7 June 1956 at the Avenida Hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Its first headquarters was situated in Khartoum for some months until a fire outbreak in the offices of the Sudanese Football Association when the organization moved near Cairo. Youssef Mohammad was the first General Secretary and Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem the president. Since 2002, the administrative center has been located in 6th of October City, near Cairo. CAF currently has 56 member associations: 55 are full members, including former associate Zanzibar (admitted in March 2017), while Réunion remains an associate member (see the CAF Members and Zones section below).

Where might it be? Possible A: town, office building, patient, medical center, candy shop  Why is \\"office building\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","output":"\\"Office building\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense for this question is due to several factors. Firstly, let's look at the context provided by the question. Bobby had a toothache, and he needed to visit a dentist. The immediate reaction for humans would be to think of a dentist's clinic or an office where the dentist practices. Secondly, the given location options for the dentist's office range from typical to less conventional. Let's discuss each option in some detail: 1. Town: In general, a dentist's office could be found in a town. However, referring to a \\"town\\" does not identify a specific location within the town, which makes it less precise as an answer. It is more a general area than a particular place.    2. Office building: This answer aligns well with human common sense because dental clinics are often located in office buildings or commercial spaces. In urban settings, dentists usually have a designated office space within a commercial area, making the \\"office building\\" a suitably specific location for finding a dentist. 3. Patient: A dentist's office would not typically be located within a patient, making this answer choice illogical or nonsensical. 4. Medical center: Though it is possible to find a dental clinic in a medical center, given it is a place where various healthcare services may be offered, it may not be the first or most common location that comes to mind regarding a dental clinic. People might generally think of standalone dental offices or buildings containing other healthcare offices when thinking of a dental clinic. 5. Candy shop: A candy shop is an unconventional and unusual location for a dental clinic. Considering that candy is primarily associated with harms to dental health, a dentist office in a candy shop would seem illogical or counterintuitive. Taking the above evaluation into account, \\"office building\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense as it is a more specific and conventional location for a dental clinic compared to other options. People typically associate dental offices with commercial spaces or office buildings, so choosing this answer option makes the most sense in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the following story. Tim needed to mount his flat screen TV on his wall but the","output":"instructions that came with the mounting kit were not clear enough. Frustrated, he threw the instructions away and decided to give it a go on his own.  Tim began by scouting for the perfect spot in his living room where he could have the best possible view of his new TV. After searching for a few minutes, he zeroed in on a spot above the fireplace. He believed he found the perfect balance between aesthetics and practicality – the heat emanating from the fireplace would not affect the TV, and it offered a great view from all the sitting positions in his living room. Pleased with himself, Tim got to work. He unpacked the mounting kit and inspected the contents, which included various screws, clamps, brackets, and a sturdy frame. Tim tried to assemble the mounting frame by connecting the pieces together, but without the instructions, he was unsure whether he was doing it right. He fumbled with the pieces for about half an hour before he finally managed to put it together – or so he thought. Next, Tim picked up his power drill to create holes for the bracket into the wall above the fireplace. He glanced back at the bracket from time to time, ensuring its alignment was correct before drilling the holes. After some precision work, he successfully mounted the bracket on the wall, securely fastening it with the provided screws.  Victorious in his feat, Tim proceeded to the final step – attaching the flat screen TV to the mount. Carefully, he lifted the TV and began aligning it with the mounting frame. However, Tim encountered a problem – the frame did not fit the TV as it should. Frustration mounted within him as he realized he had assembled the mounting frame incorrectly. Begrudgingly, Tim took down the mounting frame and started over, attempting to assemble it in a way that would properly support his TV. After several failed attempts, a light bulb went off in Tim's head - he decided to search online for a tutorial video on how to assemble this particular mounting kit. With guidance from the video, he realized his mistake and correctly assembled the mounting frame. Energized and determined, he reattached the frame to the wall bracket and proceeded to mount the flat screen TV once more. Finally, success! The TV was now securely fastened to the mounting frame and perfectly positioned on his wall. The challenge of mounting the TV without clear instructions made the end result even more satisfying. Tim spent the rest of the evening testing out his new TV, browsing different channels and streaming services. The exceptional picture quality and surround sound turned his living room into a mini theater that he could enjoy every day. He marveled at his accomplishment, resolved to rely on online tutorials and his own problem-solving skills from now on. That night Tim hosted a small movie night with a few friends to break in the newly mounted TV. He proudly shared the story of his DIY mounting adventure, eliciting chuckles and admiration from his friends. With the warm glow of the fireplace beneath, they all sat back and enjoyed watching their favorite movies on the stunning flat screen TV above, grateful for Tim's perseverance and resourcefulness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves A:","output":"The final step of the process, after the bat hears the echoed sound and its ear folds and brain adaptations help it determine the size, shape, and position of the object, is the bat using this information for navigation, hunting, and obstacle avoidance. This entire process is known as echolocation, which is a biological sonar system employed by bats and some other animals for detecting and locating objects in their environment. In the final step, the bat's brain processes the information gleaned from the echoed sound waves and translates that into a precise mental representation of the environment. This \\"auditory map\\" allows the bat to swiftly navigate its surroundings, avoid obstacles, and locate prey with remarkable accuracy, even in complete darkness. For hunting, by identifying the size, shape, and position of an object, the bat can determine whether the object is a potential prey (like an insect) or a non-target (like a tree branch). Once the bat confirms the object to be its prey, it can use the echolocation data to estimate the distance, angle, and speed at which it needs to approach and strike the prey. It continuously emits and receives echoes during this activity to update the relative positions and movements of the target, refining its strategy accordingly. This enables the bat to be an efficient and dynamic predator in terms of both foraging and capturing prey.  For navigation and obstacle avoidance, the bat continuously emits and listens to the echoes in its environment as it flies. This allows the bat to perceive obstacles, differentiate them from the prey (based on their size, shape, and position) and avoid them by adapting its flight path accordingly. This process helps the bat navigate its natural surroundings, such as dense forest or cave systems, with ease. In conclusion, the final step of the process is the bat making use of the interpreted information from the echoed sound waves, which allows it to navigate its environment, locate and identify prey, and avoid obstacles effectively. This remarkable capability, known as echolocation, is a fascinating example of biological adaptation and showcases the incredible sensory and cognitive abilities of these nocturnal creatures."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the sentiment of the following review? I love KCPA.  The venue is awesome for just about everything.  I attend the symphony series, the chamber music series, and the ballet.  I've enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there. The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient.  I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards.  This is a fun series.  The seating is limited and on the stage, up close and personal with the artist.  Prior to the performance, champagne and finger foods are served.  The food is exquisite.  After the performance, coffee and truffles or petit fours are served.  It's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend.  Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down, especially during intermissions.  I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline.  And then there is the Stage 5 Bar.  I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip.  I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail, the Black Russian.  There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Wave energy does the work of erosion at the shore. Waves erode sediments from cliffs and shorelines. The sediment in ocean water acts like sandpaper. Over time, they erode the shore. The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause ( Figure below ).   Q: What type of energy causes erosion at the shore?   A: A:","output":"Wave energy is the type of energy that causes erosion at the shore. As detailed in the given paragraph, this process occurs when waves constantly impact the shorelines and cliffs. The energy from waves is transferred to the sediments, such as rocks, sand, and other particles that make up the coastal environment. These sediments, carried by the ocean water, act like sandpaper against the shorelines and cliffs. The constant motion of waves, combined with the abrasive action of the sediments, gradually wears away the landforms and causes them to erode. Erosion can result in dramatic changes to shorelines over time, creating features such as coves, arches, and sea cliffs. The magnitude of erosion caused by wave energy depends on various factors. One such factor is the size of the waves – larger waves typically carry more energy, leading to a more powerful erosional force. Additionally, the amount and type of sediment carried in the ocean water also play a significant role in the effect of wave energy on shoreline erosion. The more sediment present in the water and the coarser the sediment particles are, the more damage the waves can potentially inflict on the coastal landscape. Other factors can also influence the erosion process, including tidal patterns, storm surges, seasonal weather patterns, and human activities (such as construction along coastal areas). While erosion from wave energy is a natural process and part of the Earth's ongoing geological activity, it can also cause challenges for coastal communities, who may need to manage changes to their local shores and habitats. In summary, wave energy is the primary force responsible for causing erosion at the shore. This energy is transferred from waves to the shore's sediments, which then act as abrasive agents that gradually wear down coastal landforms over time. The size of the waves, the amount of sediment carried by the ocean water, and other environmental factors can all contribute to the overall impact of wave energy on shoreline erosion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon. During the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF 38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn—before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa's combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF 38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking Zuikaku, the light carriers Chitose and Zuihō, and the destroyer Akizuki, all with heavy loss of life. The light carrier Chiyoda and the cruiser Tama were crippled. Ozawa transferred his flag to the light cruiser Ōyodo.

The Liberal Democrat leader revealed his party’s manifesto would target the wealthy with measures including a reformed ‘mansion tax’. In a speech seen as the start of a fight back after the Lib Dems’ disastrous European and local election results, Mr Clegg also indicated he is prepared to borrow to build homes and boost the economy through infrastructure projects. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg speaks at Bloomberg, central London where he announced the revival of his party's 'mansion tax' as a means to get more money out of the wealthy. Mr Clegg said the party was committed to reducing the deficit, but said he believed it should be done ‘in a fundamentally different way to the Conservatives’. He said: ‘The Tories have now ruled out asking the very wealthy to pay even just a bit more in tax to help the ongoing fiscal effort. Instead, they’ve said they’ll take billions more from the welfare budget.’ He added: ‘We’ll finish the job (of eliminating the deficit), of course we will – but we’ll finish it in a way that is fair. ‘So not just through further spending cuts, but also by asking those with the broadest shoulders to make some additional contributions too, including for instance through our banded Mansion Tax - extending new tax bands to higher value properties.’ The Lib Dems want the levy, which would be paid in addition to council tax, to be introduced for properties worth more than £2million. Nick Clegg said he was committed to ‘significantly’ reducing the national debt as a percentage of GDP every year from 2018/19 but said he would borrow to invest in projects to boost growth. He said: ‘We are prepared to put our shoulders to the wheel and use the muscle of the state - if necessary through borrowing - to rewire and revamp our infrastructure.’ Mr Clegg's wife Miriam Gonzalez, Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, and  British Business Secretary Vince Cable listen as the Lib Dem leader speaks at Bloomberg's central London headquarters yesterday. Up to 300,000 new homes a year are needed to meet demand, he said, adding: ‘It’s time to put our money where our mouth is. 'We have to give people the homes they need and protect the country from another crisis - and if that means borrowing a bit when times are good and debt is falling, so be it.’ He added: ‘We are not the Tories. We don’t believe in an ever-shrinking state. We are not so ideological about making cuts that we’ll deny people the things they need. ‘We’re not so dogmatic about borrowing that we’ll jeopardise Britain’s economic health. Responsibility, yes, austerity forever, no.’ Mr Clegg admitted that a series of ‘gory’ spending decisions have left young voters who ‘dream of a better future’ questioning whether the Liberal Democrats are there for them. The ‘notorious’ decision to ditch their pledge on tuition fees and the ‘pretty gritty’ and ‘downright unappealing decisions’ the party has taken in government means they have a lot of work to do to win back younger voters, he conceded. He shrugged off questions over the future of his position as party leader insisting it would not be ‘sensible’ to put someone new at the helm. He said: ‘If I thought a year before the general election all the issues that face us could be solved magically and could float off like the morning mist by just changing personnel at the top and spending several months talking to ourselves of course I’d think. But I just think - obviously I don’t think - that is sensible for the party.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"So this person named Nick Clegg, who is the leader of a group called the Liberal Democrats in the UK, wants rich people to pay more taxes. He even has an idea for a 'mansion tax' that would make people who own very expensive houses pay more. He wants to use this money to build more houses and other stuff that's good for the country. This is different from another group called the Conservatives, who want to save money by cutting other things instead.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Teach your children that it is okay for them to be different, and they do not have to follow the crowd. Teach them right from wrong when they are young, and they will (more often than not) be able to make their own decisions, instead of listening to or following others. Remember that your child is not an extension of yourself. Your child is an individual under your care, not a chance for you to relive your life through them.  When your children get old enough to make decisions for themselves, you should encourage them to choose which extra-curricular activities they want to do or what friends they want to play with. Unless you think an activity is very dangerous, or a playmate is a very bad influence, you should let your children figure things out for themselves. A child may have an opposite disposition, such as being introverted when you are extroverted, and will not be able to fit into the pattern and style that you choose, and will make his or her own decisions instead. Don't routinely do things for your children that they can learn to do for themselves.  While getting them a glass of water before bed is a nice way to make them get to sleep faster, don't do it so often that they come to expect it. If you want your child to be well-behaved, then you should model the behavior and character you hope your children will adopt and continue to live by the rules that you set. Show them by example in addition to verbal explanations. Children have a tendency to become what they see and hear unless they make a conscious and concerted effort to break the mold. You don't have to be a perfect person, but you should strive to do as you want your children to do, so you don't look hypocritical if you tell your children to be polite to others when they find you getting in a heated argument in the supermarket.  It's perfectly okay to make mistakes, but you should apologize or let your child know that the behavior is not good. You can say something like, \\"Mommy didn't mean to yell at you. She was just very upset.\\" This is better than ignoring that you made a mistake, because that will show the child that he or she should model this behavior. Want to teach kids about charity? Get involved and take your kids with you to a soup kitchen or homeless shelter and help serve up meals. Explain to them why you do acts of charity so they understand why they should. Teach kids about chores by setting a schedule and having them help you out. Don't tell your child to do something, but ask for their help.  The earlier they learn to help you, the longer they will be willing to. If you want your son or daughter to learn to share, set a good example and share your things with them. Respect their privacy as you would want them to respect yours; for example, if you teach your child that your room is out of boundaries to them, respect the same with their room. Allow them to feel that once they enter their room, they can know that no one will look through their drawers, or read their diary. This will teach them to honor their own space and to respect the privacy of others.  If your child catches you snooping through his or her things, then it may take him or her a long time to be able to truly trust you again. Allow your child to maintain their personal space and accept that it's normal for them to sometimes keep secrets from you, especially as they get older. You can balance this by having an open door policy so that they can approach you if they need help with an issue. It's important to make sure that your children eat healthy food as much as they can, that they get plenty of exercise, and that they get enough rest every night. You should encourage positive and healthy behavior without harping on it too much or making it seem like you're forcing your children to eat or act a certain way. Be the adviser, not the dictator. Let them come to these conclusions on their own while helping them see the meaning and importance of a healthy life.  One way to encourage them to exercise is to get them to play a sport early on in life, so they find a passion that is also healthy. If you start over-explaining to the child that something is unhealthy or that they shouldn't get it, they may take it the wrong way and feel like you are condemning them. Once this happens, they may no longer want to eat with you, and they may feel bad eating around you, which could make them want to sneak and hide junk food from you. When trying to enforce healthy eating habits, start it at a younger age. Giving rewards of candy to children may create a bad habit, because once they get older, some may feel they should reward themselves which can lead to obesity. While they are young, start them out with healthier snacks. Instead of chips, try goldfish (crackers), grapes, etc. The eating habits they learn as they are younger are the ones they continue to have. Emphasize on finishing their plates, and teach them to take a small portion at a time; they can always take more afterwards, but they can't put food back after it has been on their plate. If your child has questions about sex, it is important to answer their questions calmly and without embarrassment. If you don't answer their questions, this can leave them uninformed and ashamed, which can harm them later in life.  Be aware of your child's age. It is recommended to teach toddlers about their anatomy and explain conception during early childhood. Teach about puberty, privacy, and maybe sexual intercourse during middle childhood (ages 5-8). Teach tweens about contraception, the pros and cons of sex, and relationships. Although teenagers are very private people, communicate to your teenager that they can approach you if they encounter something difficult or dangerous. If your child sees you having sex, stop right away and ask them to leave. Tell them that you were having sex after the fact. They probably feel as uncomfortable as you do. Never make your child feel uncomfortable or ashamed about masturbation. Contrary to some beliefs, masturbation will not harm your child in any way. If your child speaks to you about masturbation, answer them openly and try not to feel embarrassed. Don't make decisions for them all the time; they must learn how to live with the consequences from the choices they make. After all, they will have to learn to think for themselves sometime. It's best they start when you are there to help minimize the negative consequences and accentuate the positive ones. They need to learn that their own actions have consequences (good and bad). By doing so, it helps them to become good decision makers and problem solvers so that they are prepared for independence and adulthood. Life is a great teacher. Don't be too quick to rescue your child from the results of their own actions if the consequences are not overly severe. For example, cutting themselves (in a minor way) may hurt, but it's better than leaving them unaware of why sharp objects should be avoided. Know that you can't protect your children forever, and they're better off learning life's lessons sooner than later. Though it can be hard to stand back and watch your child make a mistake, this will benefit both you and your child in the long run.  You shouldn't say \\"I told you so\\" when your child learns a life lesson on his own. Instead, let your child draw his own conclusions about what happened. Be there for your child when he makes a mistake, whether big or small. By not preventing every little issue but providing helpful guidance to let them work through the effects, you can help teach them problem-solving and coping skills. Throughout this process, be supportive and helpful; just don't do it for them or isolate them from the real world. Gambling, alcohol and drugs can jeopardize your child's financial security. Smoking, for example, almost always introduces health hazards to your child's environment. Second-hand smoke has been linked to several respiratory ailments in children. It could also contribute to the early death of a parent. Alcohol and drugs might also introduce health hazards or violence to your child's environment. Of course, if you enjoy having some wine or a few beers now and again, that's perfectly fine, as long as you model healthy consumption of alcohol and responsible behavior while you do it. There's a difference between wanting your child to be a responsible, mature individual and forcing your child to be perfect or to live up to your idea of what perfect should be. You shouldn't push your child to get perfect grades or to be the best player on his soccer team; instead, encourage good study habits and good sportsmanship, and let your child put in the effort that he is capable of.  If you act like you only expect the best, your child will feel like he or she may never measure up, and may even rebel in the process. You don't want to be the person that your child is afraid of because he feels like he will never measure up. You want to be a cheerleader for your child, not a drill sergeant. Though you may think you have already molded and raised your child into the person he or she will become by the time your child dons his or her graduation cap, this is far from true. Your parenting will have a life-long effect on your child and you should always give your child the love and affection he needs, even if you're hundreds of miles away. While you won't always be a constant daily presence in your child's life, you should always let your children know that you care about them and that you'll be there for them, no matter what. Your children will still turn to you for advice, and will still be affected by what you say no matter what age they are. As the years go on, you can not only improve your parenting techniques, but you can start to think about how to be a good grandparent! Summary:","output":"Teaching kids to be different and make their own decisions is important. Show them good behavior by being a good example. Help them learn to do things for themselves and respect their privacy. Teach them about healthy eating, exercise, and rest. When they ask about difficult topics like sex, answer them honestly without making them feel ashamed. Let them make decisions and learn from their own mistakes, and be there for them when they need your support. Avoid pushing them too hard to be perfect, and be a cheerleader instead of a drill sergeant. Remember, your parenting will have a life-long effect on your child, so always give them love and affection no matter their age."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Your task is to summarize them. If you're moving to a newly built house, say goodbye to mail delivery at your door.      And if some House Republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away.      The U.S. Postal Service is marching towards a more \\"centralized delivery,\\" where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. Local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments.      In the past year, the cash-strapped Postal Service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery.      But Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican leading the House effort to save the postal service, wants more. He has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box.      \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,\\" said Issa, who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.      Moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. Right now, 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep.      It costs 353 per stop for a delivery in most American cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. By contrast, curbside mail box delivery costs 224, while cluster boxes cost 160, according to a report from the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General.      Delivering mail is the agency's largest fixed cost -- 30 billion. Ending such door deliveries would save 4.5 billion a year. That's more than the 3 billion it would have saved from ending Saturday mail service, according to government reports.      Related: Los Angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bites      That's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the Greeting Card Association, which supports Saturday service.      But unions say it's a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled.      \\"It's madness,\\" said Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers. \\"The idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in Buffalo, New York, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.\\"      Yet postal officials say everything's on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. Earlier this year, it tried to end Saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision.      The Postal Service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more Americans move to electronic billing and e-mailing.      In 2012, the agency lost 16 billion. Last year, the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling 11 billion. The agency has also exhausted a 15 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury.      Ending a Congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency's woes.      As it awaits for help from Congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. One of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments.      \\"Prior to this spring, we'd work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery --- now the Postal Service makes that decision,\\" said Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan.      Related: Wave of federal retirees to hit government      In Cranberry, Pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in April from the Postal Service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments.      Community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. Township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes.      \\"We understand what's driving this is a cost savings,\\" said Cranberry Township Manager Jerry Andree. \\"But you can't just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.\\"      For now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or Congress changes the law, said Steven Hutkins, a professor of literature at New York University, and a postal service expert.      \\"The big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers,\\" said Hutkins, who writes the blog Save the Post Office. ||||| Congressional effort to cut Postal Service losses proposing an end to door-to-door mail delivery.      The Postal Service will end Saturday delivery for first class mail this summer, Postmaster General Patrick Donahue said Wednesday. (Photo: Doug Benz for USA TODAY) Story Highlights Proposal could affect up to 37 million addresses      Labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs the post office an average 353 a year per address            Cluster boxes cost the agency just 160 a year      First, it was doing away with Saturday delivery. Now, door-to-door service could be coming to an end.      In an effort designed to cut costs at the cash-strapped agency by up to 4.5 billion a year, congressman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is proposing that the U.S. Postal Service phase out door-to-door delivery and shift service curbside and to neighborhood cluster boxes.      The proposal — due for vote by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday — would affect about 37 million residences and businesses.      The Postal Service spends about 30 billion annually on mail delivery, losing 15.9 billion last year alone. It does not receive federal assistance, getting revenue from postage sales, delivery services and other products. But mail service has dropped nearly 25% from 215 billion pieces delivered in 2006 to a current volume of 160 billion, says Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan.      The Postmaster General's office estimates labor-intensive door-to-door delivery costs an average 353 a year. Curbside delivery averages 224; cluster boxes, just 160. The Postal Service, currently making 54 million curbside deliveries and 40 million to cluster boxes and central locations, has been moving toward collective deliveries at shopping malls, business parks and newer residential developments.      \\"A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,'' Issa said in a statement. \\"Done right, these reforms can improve the customer experience through a more efficient Postal Service.\\"      Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has been seeking flexibility in the way the Postal Service delivers mail, such as cutting Saturday delivery — which drew strong public and congressional criticism when it was proposed last year. In April, the Postal Service said it was scuttling plans to end Saturday service this summer, although ending six-day service is still eventually possible, says Ali Ahmad, communications adviser to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which Issa chairs.      The National Letter Carriers Association, which opposes ending six-day delivery, is also against ending door-to-door delivery, which is says would hurt jobs and harm elderly and shut-ins who would have difficulty receiving mail.      Issa's proposal would allow for free hardship exemptions and door-to-door deliveries for small, unspecified fees, Ahmad says.

Unfortunately, millions of kids can't hear what their teachers are saying. And it's not because these students are _ . Often, it's the room's fault. Building architecture and building design can createecho -filled classrooms that make hearing difficult. Children with hearingimpairments suffer most from noisy classrooms. They sometimes can't hear questions that other students ask in class. Compared with kids with healthy hearing, they have a harder time picking up new vocabulary words by hearing them in talking. Even kids with normal hearing have a harder time in the classroom when there's too much noise. Younger children in particular have trouble separating important sounds - like a teacher's voice - from background noise. Kids with learning disabilities and speechimpediments and kids for whom English is a second language also have a harder time learning in noisy situations. In recent years, scientists who study sound have been asking schools to reduce background noise, which may include loud air-conditioners and pipes. They're also targeting outdoor noises, such as highway traffic. Noise reduction is a big deal. Why? Because quieter classrooms might make you smarter by letting you hear your lessons better. \\"It's so obvious that we should have quiet rooms that allow for access to the lesson,\\" says Dan Ostergren, a hearing scientist. \\"Sometimes it surprises me that we spend so much time discussing this topic.

Information:  - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory.  - 3D Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror.  - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Escape is an early ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by New Generation Software in 1982 . \`\` Can you ESCAPE from the monsters ? You must search through the maze to find the axe which will enable you to break down the door and ESCAPE . But it is not that easy - the Triceratops hides behind the hedges and the Pteranodon soars over the maze to swoop down upon you ''  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - New Generation Software was a firm best known for the computer games with innovative graphics it produced for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers. It was conceived in the spring of 1982 shortly after the lead developer, Malcolm Evans created \\"3D Monster Maze\\" (initially released by J. K. Greye Software, and later republished by \\"New Generation Software\\")one of the first 3D games for a home computer.  - J.K. Greye Software was a British software company set up by J.K.Greye in early 1981 and 6 months later joined by Malcolm Evans after they met at a Bath Classical Guitar & Lute Society meeting in Bath in 1981. They produced computer games for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum home computers.     What is the relationship between 'escape ' and 'malcolm evans'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Escape' and Malcolm Evans is that Evans is the developer behind the video game 'Escape.' Malcolm Evans is a programmer who was active in the early days of home computing. He is best known for creating the groundbreaking game '3D Monster Maze' for the Sinclair ZX81 platform in 1981. After the success of '3D Monster Maze,' Malcolm Evans co-founded the company New Generation Software, which focused on developing innovative games for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers, including the game 'Escape.' So, the connection between 'Escape' and Malcolm Evans is that he was the developer responsible for creating the game, and it was released by his company, New Generation Software, in 1982."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar.\\", does this mean that \\"The man is playing an electric guitar.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"A man with a white jacket is playing the acoustic guitar\\" does not mean \\"The man is playing an electric guitar.\\" These two sentences refer to different kinds of guitars.  To fully understand this, we need to distinguish between an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar. The fundamental difference between these two types of guitars is tied to their mechanism of sound production. An acoustic guitar is designed to produce sound primarily through acoustic means. Its sound is produced using its own resonant chamber, the soundboard. This architecture amplifies the vibrations of the strings, which the player plucks or strums, creating a fuller, rich sound. There is no need for any external amplification like amps or electricity because the guitar's design itself aids sound projection. Acoustic guitars have been around for hundreds of years and are widely used in many types of music including blues, country, classical, and folk. On the other hand, an electric guitar relies on electronic amplification to produce sound. Electric guitars have magnetic pickups installed that pick up the vibration of the strings and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then sent to an amplifier. The amplifier, upturns the signal and sends it to a speaker which outputs the sound. Hence, the sound an electric guitar produces is in fact, an amplified version of the string vibrations. This makes them suitable for diverse styles of music like rock, pop, jazz, and heavy metal. To encapsulate, the specific type of guitar that a person is playing – whether acoustic or electric – can bring about significant differences in terms of the sound produced, the required equipment, and also the playing technique. Therefore, saying a man with a white jacket is playing an acoustic guitar does not equate to saying the man is playing an electric guitar. The distinction is important because an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar are different instruments, despite both being types of guitars."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Does the sentence \\"At this time Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted, unsuccessfully, to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What speech did Eisenhower give after Stalin died?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What speech did Eisenhower give after Stalin died?\\" The Chance for Peace speech, also referred to as the \\"Atoms for Peace\\" speech, was delivered by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 16, 1953. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, passed away on March 5, 1953. The chronological sequence of events aligns, making the speech an appropriate response to the question.  To give more context, during the early years of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, both sides were engaged in an intense arms race, culminating in the creation and deployment of nuclear weapons. After Stalin's death, there was a brief window of opportunity to reassess the relationship between the two superpowers and potentially alleviate the tensions between them. In the Chance for Peace speech, President Eisenhower expressed his concerns about the consequences of the arms race and offered an alternative vision for the future. He advocated cooperation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., along with other nations, on peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Eisenhower proposed that both countries pool their resources to create an international organization that would oversee peaceful nuclear development, emphasizing its potential benefits in the fields of energy, agriculture, medicine, and other areas of global importance. Unfortunately, Eisenhower's vision did not come to fruition during the time. Trust between the two superpowers remained low, and the arms race continued, leading to the development and proliferation of even more powerful nuclear weapons. However, his speech did inspire ideas later adopted by the international community, like the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957, which is responsible for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. To summarize, the sentence accurately answers the question by pointing out that Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech after Stalin's death. It also briefly mentions the main idea of the speech, which was an attempt to offer opportunities for peaceful cooperation between the U.S. and Soviet Union and slow down the nuclear arms race."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Question: How did the scientists reach the finding?

The group consists of the Corr siblings; Andrea (lead vocals, tin whistle, ukulele); Sharon (violin, vocals); Caroline (drums, percussion, piano, bodhran, vocals) and Jim (guitar, piano, keyboards, vocals). They are from Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland. The Corrs have released seven studio albums and numerous singles, which have reached Platinum in many countries, and have sold 40 million albums worldwide. Context: In 2000, The Corrs returned to mainstream success with their third album. Unlike their previous albums, In Blue moved towards mainstream pop. In Blue hit number one in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top spot during its second week in Sweden and Spain.  The Corrs worked with Alejandro Sanz on In Blue, recording \\"Una Noche (One Night)\\", a duet between Sanz and Andrea Corr; Sanz played Andrea's love interest in the music video. In return, The Corrs performed \\"Me Ire (The Hardest Day)\\" with him on his album, El Alma Al Aire. The Corrs collaborated with Robert Lange to produce a mainstream hit single, \\"Breathless\\", which reached number 20 in the Billboard Hot 100, number seven in Australia, number three in Ireland and New Zealand, and topped the charts in the UK. The album went straight to number one in the Irish Albums Chart, the third highest single-week sales in the history of the charts, behind U2's The Best of 1980-1990 and Oasis' Be Here Now. In Blue achieved Platinum sales in the US, double platinum in the UK, and 4x Platinum in Australia.  During the production of the album, the Corrs' mother, Jean, died while waiting for a lung transplant. She was buried at St. Patrick's cemetery in Dundalk and Bono, Larry Mullen, Jr., Brian Kennedy and Paul Brady were among the congregation at the funeral. \\"No More Cry\\", written by Andrea and Caroline Corr for the album, was written to help their father get over his grief.  In 2001, The Corrs released their first compilation album, Best of The Corrs. The album featured previously released songs and new tracks, such as the singles \\"Would You Be Happier?\\", \\"Make You Mine\\" and \\"Lifting Me\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: John was sitting at point C near a railway track. Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E.  and a hint : Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below.  Please answer this question : Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E? Answer:","output":"Point E would have a lower frequency compared to point D. This is due to the Doppler effect, which states that when a source of sound waves is moving relative to a stationary listener, the perceived frequency of the sound waves changes.  In this scenario, John sitting at point C hears the train coming towards him from point A. As the train moves past point C and travels from point D to point E, the sound waves become more spread out since the train is moving away from John. This causes the frequency of the sound waves to decrease, resulting in a lower pitch. Therefore, the frequency is lower at point E compared to point D."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is the current dean of the Columbia Business School? Title: Inside Job Movie plot: The documentary is split into five parts. It begins by examining how Iceland was highly deregulated in 2000 and the privatization of its banks. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and AIG collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession. Part I: How We Got Here[edit] The American financial industry was regulated from 1940 to 1980, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a savings and loan crisis cost taxpayers about 124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In March 2000, the Internet Stock Bubble burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies that they knew would fail, resulting in 5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, derivatives became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns), two financial conglomerates (Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase), three securitized insurance companies (AIG, MBIA, AMBAC) and the three rating agencies (Moodyâs, Standard &amp; Poor's, Fitch). Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs AAA ratings. Subprime loans led to predatory lending. Many home owners were given loans they could never repay. Part II: The Bubble (2001â2007)[edit] During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by an investment bank versus the bank's own assets reached unprecedented levels. The credit default swap (CDS), was akin to an insurance policy. Speculators could buy CDSs to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than 3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs,... A:","output":"Can't answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - As long as they would like - not enough information - until it gets too expensive - on occasion Answer:","output":"As long as they would like. The Mediterranean Diet is essentially a lifestyle choice rather than a short-term diet plan. When adopting the Mediterranean Diet, individuals can choose to stay on it for as long as they would like. This diet emphasizes long-term healthy eating habits, moderation, and the consumption of nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, fish, and healthy fats like olive oil. By incorporating these foods and habits consistently, it can help to promote overall health, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases, improving heart health, and promoting good digestion. While some people may find the Mediterranean Diet expensive due to the focus on high-quality, fresh ingredients, the potential long-term health benefits that come with following the diet can potentially offset these costs. Additionally, one could find creative ways to make the diet more affordable by purchasing in-season produce, buying grains and legumes in bulk, and reducing overall food wastage. As with any diet or lifestyle change, it is essential to recognize that every individual is different, and one's personal preferences, dietary needs, and health conditions should be taken into account when deciding to adopt the Mediterranean Diet. It is crucial always to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to your dietary habits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When they took just one point from Chelsea and Manchester City in the space of a week, any title challenge from Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United was written off. Their defence was porous, their midfield void of invention and their forwards misfiring. Even David Moyes had fared better than the new Dutch boss. A winter of discontent lay in store as November beckoned. But the forecast has changed at Old Trafford. Winter, thus far, has been a season of contentment for Van Gaal. The title race, having doubled in size when Chelsea stalled and City surged, now has a third competitor. United, after six wins on the spin, have hit top speed. Wayne Rooney is mobbed by his Manchester United team-mates after opening the scoring against Liverpool. Rooney sent Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones the wrong way to set up United's win over their chief rivals. Louis van Gaal has transformed United in the past six weeks, in which his side have won six times. As it stands: The Premier League table on Monday. The 3-0 victory over Liverpool was not without its flaws and they did, of course, need goalkeeper David de Gea at his best. But there was an air of inevitability about their triumph; such expectancy is what has marked United as champions throughout the Premier League era. They were quicker, stronger, more hungry and clinical. There was cunning, too, exemplified by the brilliant Michael Carrick. Van Gaal, it was said, was considering Carrick for the captain’s role before he was injured in the same week as the manager’s unveiling. Armband or not, he is leading their renaissance. Six starts: six wins. His return has facilitated the realisation of this team’s potential, of which there were early-season glimpses. Now, it is there for all to see. Robin van Persie, having baffled all with his failure to produce despite the arrival of his mentor, now has four goals from four games. Without his strikes two seasons back, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have signed off with a league winner’s medal. Likewise this time around - without an on-form and on-target Van Persie, they cannot challenge. At Southampton, where United were admittedly poor, the Dutch striker had two chances and took them both. They won 2-1. That is the difference. Then there is Wayne Rooney. While Van Persie has four in four, the captain has three in that period. Having worn a frown for much of last season, he is playing with a smile, free of the pressure which had appeared to weigh so heavily amid the failings of his team-mates. Robin van Persie has scored four goals in his last four games to find his best form again at last. The return of Michael Carrick (left) has provided experience and helped inspire United's recent resurgence. David de Gea (centre) has been a rock in goal, almost single-handedly repelling Liverpool on Sunday. Even the supporting cast are now playing their part; Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young are all enjoying new direction under Van Gaal. 20 Dec Aston Villa vs Man Utd. 26 Dec Man Utd vs Newcastle. 28 Dec Tottenham vs Man Utd. 1 Jan Stoke vs Man Utd. 4 Jan Accrington or Yeovil vs Man Utd (FA Cup third round) 11 Jan Man Utd v Southampton. 17 Jan QPR v Man Utd. 31 Jan Man Utd v Leicester. Fellaini, aided by Carrick, is helping to shield a backline previously left brutally exposed. They have conceded just once at Old Trafford in six hours and, in De Gea, they finally boast a goalkeeper worthy of mention alongside the likes of Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. Monday’s Champions League draw took place minus the previously ubiquitous United. But that is no bad thing. Even better, they managed to dodge the Europa League and made an early exit from the Capital One Cup. Chelsea, meanwhile, have a League Cup quarter-final at Derby County on Wednesday, while Europe will serve as a distraction to domestic affairs when the knockout rounds resume with a tie against Paris Saint-Germain in February. Manchester City, too, are not without their worries. Sergio Aguero is sidelined until the new year, as is his replacement Edin Dzeko and skipper Vincent Kompany. Barcelona lie in wait in the Champions League and then there is Frank Lampard, match-winner again on Saturday and a player they can ill afford to lose to the MLS, where he is contracted to play in 2015. Chelsea have seen their lead at the top of the Premier League cut to just three points. Manchester City must cope without star striker Sergio Aguero until the new year due to injury. Rooney (left), Van Persie and Juan Mata celebrate the win that confirmed United among the title contenders. VIDEO 6 wins in a row, my wife is happy - Van Gaal. Before the new year, United face Aston Villa, Newcastle and Tottenham. They will be favourites to extend their winning run to nine matches, all the while quickening the pace in pursuit of the top two. It is all a far cry from the anonymity of their mid-table malaise just six weeks ago. Chelsea were as good as champions, City would take second and, as for United, they could do battle with Southampton, Swansea and West Ham for the Europa League places. They were 10th, residing only in the top half by virtue of goal difference over West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United. They were closer to the bottom than the top. But United are motoring through the gears, the title race is on and there are three teams who can win it... Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well.

What is the correct answer to this question?","output":"The sentence that describes a characteristic of offspring produced by sexual reproduction is \\"Offspring produced by sexual reproduction have genetic variation, resulting from the combination of genes from both parents.\\" Sexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that involves the fusion of two different types of specialized cells called gametes. One of these gametes is the egg from the female parent, and the other is the sperm from the male parent. This fusion, called fertilization, results in the formation of a zygote. This process involves the combination of genetic material from both parents, thereby producing offspring with genetic variation. This variation is observed because the genes from each parent may come together in innumerable ways during the formation of gametes. Moreover, during the process of meiosis, where these reproductive cells are produced, natural genetic recombination occurs which introduces additional genetic diversity. These combinations result in an offspring that is genetically unique, differing even from their parents and siblings unless they are identical twins. It's important to highlight that genetic variation plays a crucial role in the survival and adaptability of a species. The diversity within a population offers a higher chance of individuals being better suited to withstand changes in environment, diseases, or alterations in the availability of resources. If a significant change occurs in a species' environment, it may wipe out those individuals that have less favorable characteristics, while those with more favorable traits may survive and reproduce, passing on these advantageous traits to their future generations. Also essential to remember is that sexual reproduction usually also involves the processes of courtship and mating. These often complex behaviors add an additional level of selection, where traits that increase an individual's chances of mating successfully (like physical attributes or certain behaviors) might be passed on at a greater frequency. So, in summary, the most fundamental characteristic of offspring produced by sexual reproduction is the genetic variation that results from the mixing of parental genes, providing a rich source of diversity upon which natural selection can act."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: London Underground The world's first subway was built in London in 1863. At the time,the government was looking for a way to reduce traffic problems in the city of London. The poor areas of the city were so crowded with people that it was almost impossible for horse carriages to get through. The city officials were interested in trying to make it possible for workers to live outside of London and travel easily to work each day. If people had a cheap and convenient way that they could depend on to go to and from work, they would relocate their homes outside of the city. This  would  help ease  the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born. The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did . It carried 9 million riders in its first year.

Premise: Receipt of the invoice or bill from the supplier or vendor represents a claim against the government for the items sent or delivered per the government's purchase order. Hypothesis: Invoices and bills are never sent out. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. To understand why, let's break down and analyze the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Receipt of the invoice or bill from the supplier or vendor represents a claim against the government for the items sent or delivered per the government's purchase order.\\" The premise highlights the process of how an invoice or bill is used to make a claim against the government in the context of items sent or delivered according to a purchase order. An invoice or a bill serves as a legal document issued by a supplier or vendor to a customer (in this case, the government) as evidence for the claim. It indicates details about the items, their quantity, agreed prices, and other necessary terms. When the government receives an invoice or bill, it recognizes that the supplier or vendor requests payment for the delivered goods or services provided in accordance with the purchase order. Hypothesis: \\"Invoices and bills are never sent out.\\" The hypothesis presents an alternative scenario where invoices and bills are not sent out at all. In this case, there would be no legal document to substantiate claims for payment related to goods or services provided. Without invoices or bills being sent out, the suppliers or vendors would have no backing for their claims against the government as per their purchase orders, which would ultimately disrupt the entire procurement process. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not supported or entailed by the given premise. The premise discusses the importance of invoices and bills as necessary legal documents for the suppliers or vendors to claim payment against the government. In contrast, the hypothesis assumes a situation where invoices and bills do not exist, which would invalidate the mechanism described in the premise. These two statements do not complement or imply each other; thus, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester? is inside the article: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

Police Detain Student Gunman After Moscow School Shooting Updated Feb. 3, 2014 12:38 p.m. ET MOSCOW--Frantic parents came to collect their children, police swarmed and walled off the premises and crowds huddled outside a pink-and-white school in the freezing cold, shivering in the aftermath of a violent shooting by a student. It's a scene all too familiar in the U.S. after tragedies such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, but until Monday such a harrowing sequence of events largely hadn't transpired in modern Russia, a country already on high security alert days before hosting its first Winter Olympic Games. Fifteen-year-old straight-A student Sergei Gordeyev stormed into Moscow's School 263 mid-day in a long women's fur coat that concealed two rifles, and proceeded to shoot his geography teacher point-blank in the chest and head before taking a classroom hostage, fellow student Lyudmila Arkhipova recalled in a Russian television interview. \\"He said he wanted to know if there is life after death,\\" Ms. Arkhipova, who was among the hostages, told Russia's LifeNews. \\"It was clear that he was really scared and was not himself.\\" She said he was also carrying a bag with extra bullets and a knife. Soon, Mr. Gordeyev's mother and grandmother began calling on his mobile phone to try to calm him down, and eventually his father showed up at the classroom and talked his son out of the situation, Ms. Arkhipova said. \\"(His father) literally saved our lives,\\" she said. In a separate interview, she said his father talked him out of killing himself. But for some inside the school it was already too late: Geography teacher Andrei Kirillov, 29, died on the spot, and Mr. Gordeyev shot also two policemen when they arrived at the scene, killing one and wounding another, Investigative Committee Spokesman Vladimir Markin said in a statement. Mr. Gordeyev has been detained and is being investigated for hostage-taking, murder and assault on law-enforcement officers, Mr. Markin added. \\"Investigators are questioning the detainee with the help of experts,\\" he said. \\"They are investigating the reasons that impelled the teenager to commit the crime. Psychological and psychiatric examinations have been ordered, and investigators will soon decide the question of restrictive measures against him.\\" High-profile school shootings are nearly unprecedented in Russia. Monday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin ordered an immediate check of safety measures at the capital's schools. The incident comes nearly a decade after a group of terrorists took a school hostage in the southern city of Beslan, leaving hundreds dead. Some officials on Monday began to blame the incident on a corrupting American influence. \\"I can barely remember something like this ever happening,\\" Valery Ryazansky, a senator in Russia's Federation Council, told the Interfax news agency. \\"We're not America, where a school shooting happens practically every day. This teenager probably got an eyeful of these American plots.\\" At a meeting with cultural officials on Monday in the Russian city of Pskov, President Vladimir Putin urged the country to better teach its young generation to understand and value theater, drama and music. \\"Maybe if we did that in the right way, the kind of tragedies like the one in Moscow today wouldn't happen,\\" he said. Mr. Putin did not elaborate on the shooting. For students at the Moscow school, the event brought unprecedented shock. Fifteen-year-old Anton Alifatov was in the middle of Russian class on the third floor when the events began unfolding two floors below. He said the students suddenly heard a pop. \\"We thought something probably had fallen,\\" Mr. Alifatov recalled. Then another teacher came into his classroom to break the news, and everyone began to evacuate into neighboring school and local government buildings, he said. Outside the school--a three-story building sandwiched between Soviet-era block apartments in a working-class part of northeast Moscow--a picture began to emerge of a tall-and-skinny top achiever who had excelled in Russia's high-pressure physics and math culture and showed few if any signs of violent behavior. \\"He's very smart, outgoing enough,\\" said 16-year-old classmate Anna Dmitrieva, who didn't go to school Monday but came to the building with her twin sister once she heard the news. \\"He didn't have a ton of friends because he studied a lot.\\" Ms. Dmitrieva described him as a tall teenager with curly brown hair who looked skinny but actually was known among his classmates for being able to do a lot of push-ups and pull-ups. She said she believed he intended to go to a top university and become a physicist. A number of students, including Ms. Dmitrieva, said he didn't seem to have any sort of known conflict with the geography teacher who was killed. She said Mr. Kirillov, was \\"great.\\" \\"I would say he was one of the best teachers in the school,\\" Ms. Dmitrieva said.

Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  Story: John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine.  Question: Which component would not increase the force applied, comp A or comp B?

Article: Many drivers say the large digital billboards flashing ads every few seconds along Bay Area freeways are just too bright and too distracting. And they may be right. A Swedish study published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention concludes that digital billboards hold the gazes of drivers longer than two seconds. Previous studies have shown that anything that takes a driver's eyes off the road for that length of time increases the risks of a crash. \\"This study proves what is common sense when it comes to digital billboards,\\" says Mary Tracy, president of Scenic America, a national nonprofit group that seeks to limit billboards. \\"Bright, constantly changing signs on the sides of roads are meant to attract and keep the attention of drivers, and this study confirms that this is exactly what they do.\\" The Federal Highway Administration allowed digital signs for the first time in 2007 after concluding they did not pose a significant danger. But a follow-up report is pending   and could be released this year. California has no law banning the billboards, and is one of 39 states that allows them. \\"We would need to review more research, so it's too early to call for a ban,\\" says Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \\"There is a role for digital messaging, such as conveying urgent information and other safety messages.\\" There are more than 1,800 digital billboards nationwide, more than double the number five years ago. While no data indicate an increase in accidents due to the Bay Area signs, many drivers are opposed to them. \\"Monstrosities\\" is what Merlin Dorfman of San Jose calls them, while insurance agent David Whitlock says he has found them a major distraction. \\"They're much too bright at night,\\" he says. \\"When the advertisement switches from a bright color to a darker one, your eyes cannot adjust fast enough, and you end up losing sight of the roadway.\\" Officials with sign companies could not be reached for comment, but Bryan Parker, an executive vice president for...

Natural environment: Observational research allows for the study of behavior in a natural, real-world setting, which can produce more ecologically valid results. 2. Useful for complex behaviors: Observational research can help to study complex behaviors that may be difficult to study through controlled experimental methods. 3. Studying rare events: Observational research can be a useful tool for studying rare events or behaviors that are difficult to reproduce in a controlled environment. 4. Ethical considerations: Observational research might be more ethical in situations where interventions or manipulations in experiments would be inappropriate. Disadvantages of observational research: 1. Lack of control: Observational research lacks the strong control that experimental methods offer, making causal inferences difficult to determine. 2. Potential bias: Observers may inadvertently introduce bias by influencing the subjects' behavior or interpreting the observations based on their own perspective. 3. Time-consuming: Observational research can be time-consuming, particularly when trying to obtain a large enough sample or capture rare events. 4. Ethical concerns: There can be ethical concerns when conducting observational research, especially when the subjects are unaware that they are being observed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After the steam has done its work by pushing the piston and powering the train's motion, it needs to be released to make room for fresh steam to enter the cylinder.

As the used steam exits the system, it loses pressure and cools down, turning back into water.

Understand the context: A crab is trying to reach the ocean, and we need to determine what it must cross to achieve this goal. 2. Evaluate each option:    a. Lakes: Crabs are marine creatures that primarily live in oceans, so crossing a lake wouldn't necessarily help them reach the ocean. Lakes are not always connected to the ocean.    b. Shore line: This term typically refers to the area where the land meets the ocean. For a crab to enter the ocean, it would have to cross the shore line, making this option a plausible choice.    c. Shallow waters: Shallow waters often are a part of the shoreline, so this option might also be considered. However, crossing shallow waters alone wouldn't necessarily guarantee that the crab reaches the ocean.    d. Tidepools: Tidepools are isolated formations that occur within the intertidal zone where water gets trapped during low tide, which can contain various marine creatures, such as crabs. While some crabs may utilize tidepools temporarily, crossing these wouldn't directly lead them to the ocean.    e. Atlantic Ocean: Since the question asks about a crab's journey to the ocean in general, specifying the Atlantic Ocean isn't necessary and limits the scope of the answer. 3. Choose the best option: Out of all options offered, \\"shore line\\" is the most logical choice because it accurately represents the area that a crab must cross to reach the ocean, regardless of the specific body of water it may be entering.

The boyfriend and I were looking to branch out from our usual breakfast haunts but the minute we pulled up to Black Bear Diner we should have kept driving to The Farmhouse in Gilbert. One look at this place and we should have known this was not gonna be great.  Black Bear Diner is pretty much a bear-themed Denny's. I ordered the \\"small portion\\" breakfast and boyfriend ordered pancakes. My small breakfast was 2 eggs, a huge portion of hashbrowns, a gigantic biscuit and bacon. There was nothing small about this breakfast. The menu said for seniors and smaller appetites. They've got some hungry seniors in Gilbert apparently.  The eggs were tasteless and the bacon was meh. The hashbrowns were good though, I'll give them that. Boyfriend's pancakes were also flavorless and really thick and heavy. Nothing light and fluffy about these flapjacks. They were kinda like a brick with syrup.  We left feeling like we had wasted our weekend breakfast. Maybe lunch or dinner is better but I don't think we'll be back to find out.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be categorized as predominantly negative. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the sentiment: 1. The reviewer starts off by sharing their intention to try a new breakfast place, but as they pull up to Black Bear Diner, they express immediate regret for not going to their preferred location instead. 2. The reviewer's description of the diner as a \\"bear-themed Denny's\\" suggests that it is not a unique or special experience. 3. The mention of the \\"small portion\\" breakfast being much larger than small and not meeting the menu expectations leads to disappointment. 4. The reviewer describes the taste of various menu items as either tasteless or mediocre, with only the hashbrowns receiving a positive remark. 5. Boyfriend's pancakes are also described negatively, being flavorless, heavy, and unfluffy. 6. The last sentences express regret for wasting their weekend breakfast and doubt they would return for lunch or dinner. Overall, the negative aspects of the review overpower the couple of positive comments, which leads to the predominant negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from the following. - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What are some causes of a small lump in my earlobe? A small lump in your earlobe can have several potential causes. Some of the most common causes include: 1. Cysts: A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in your earlobe. Cysts are usually benign, and they may sometimes need to be drained or surgically removed. 2. Sebaceous cysts: These are a type of cyst that form in sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance called sebum. They are generally not harmful but can become inflamed or infected, in which case they might need to be treated by a doctor. 3. Acne: Pimples and blackheads can affect the earlobe area, leading to small, painful lumps. 4. Keloids: A keloid is an overgrowth of scar tissue that sometimes forms after an injury to the skin, such as a piercing. These raised, thick, and sometimes itchy lumps can be uncomfortable and difficult to treat. 5. Trauma: Injuries to the earlobe can cause inflammation, swelling, and lumps. This can sometimes result from an allergic reaction to earrings, sports injuries, or even aggressive earlobe pinching. 6. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign tumor made of fat cells that can form in the earlobe. They are usually painless and may not require any treatment unless they grow large or become cosmetically concerning. 7. Infections: Some infections can cause swollen glands or a painful lump behind the earlobe or in the surrounding tissues. If you suspect you have an infection, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional. Question 2: Why do I have a lump in my neck? A lump in your neck can be caused by various factors. Some of the most common causes include: 1. Lymph nodes: Swollen lymph nodes, or lymphadenopathy, often cause neck lumps. Lymph nodes play an essential role in your immune system, and they can become enlarged in response to an infection or other medical conditions. 2. Cysts: As in the earlobe, cysts can also occur in the neck and cause a lump. These fluid-filled sacs can be benign but might require treatment if they become infected, inflamed, or grow large. 3. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign fatty tumor that can occur in the neck, leading to a painless lump. They generally do not require treatment unless they become bothersome due to size or cosmetic concerns. 4. Thyroid nodules: Thyroid nodules are growths that appear in the thyroid gland located in the neck. Most thyroid nodules are harmless, but some can cause problems with thyroid hormone production, leading to symptoms. 5. Abscess: A neck abscess is a collection of pus that forms due to a bacterial infection. This can cause a painful lump in the neck that requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications. 6. Tumors: Although less common, neck lumps can sometimes be a sign of more severe conditions, such as malignant tumors. These may arise from various tissues in the neck, including the thyroid gland, lymph nodes, or salivary glands. Select from the following. - no - yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is specifically about the causes of a small lump in the earlobe, while question 2 focuses on the reasons for a lump in the neck. Although some causes may overlap (such as cysts, lipomas, or infections), there are different sets of possible reasons for lumps in these body areas, and consequently, the questions address distinct concerns."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Where could you find a person standing next to a net?

Leaders of different faiths often receive gifts as tokens of appreciation, and each one holds a special memory or significance. In this article, we explore the stories behind some of the most memorable gifts religious leaders have received over the years, delving into the heart and meaning behind these sacred offerings. Step 1: Gather Stories from Various Religious Leaders To create a diverse and inclusive article, we will gather stories from leaders of different faiths including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. We will reach out to religious leaders to acquire their first-hand experiences, which will give the article a more authentic and personal touch. Step 2: Share the Meaning Behind Each Gift Once we have gathered stories from religious leaders, we will delve into the significance behind each gift and provide context for the reader. This could include descriptions of the gift itself, the occasion it was given, and the relationship between the giver and the receiver. Establishing the meaning behind each gift will allow the reader to better understand the importance of the gift in the context of the particular religious tradition.

Example: In the Islamic tradition, giving gifts is seen as a way to strengthen relationships and create love between people. It's even encouraged to exchange gifts on various occasions like Eid celebrations and weddings. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is known to have said, \\"Exchange gifts, as that will lead to increasing your love for one another.\\" Step 4: Draw a Universal Message To conclude the article, we will draw upon the common threads found in the stories shared by the religious leaders. These universal themes, such as love, generosity, and the importance of community, can be used to craft a message that transcends religious borders. By highlighting these shared values, the article will aim to foster a sense of unity and understanding among people of different faiths. Example: Despite the unique cultural and theological differences between various religious traditions, the stories shared by these leaders demonstrate that at the core, all faiths encourage acts of goodwill, kindness, and generosity. Memorable gifts can serve as powerful reminders of the essential values that unite us all, from the highest spiritual authorities to each individual believer.

By understanding the meaning behind these gifts and the role they play in various religious practices, readers will be better equipped to appreciate and respect the bond between humanity and spirituality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1982, the band released the album Hot Space, a departure from their trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of rock, pop rock, dance, funk, and R&B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the band's history, and Taylor and May lamented the new sound, with both being very critical of the influence Mercury's personal manager Paul Prenter had on the singer. May was also scathing of Prenter, who was Mercury's manager from the early 1980s to 1984, for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations, such as the US networks, and their vital connection between the artist and the community, and for denying them access to Mercury. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space Tour, as their success there had waned, although they would perform on American television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of Saturday Night Live. Queen left Elektra Records, their label in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, and signed onto EMI/Capitol Records.

Q: how many layers in the earth's core? A:","output":"A: The Earth's core is divided into two distinct layers, which are the inner core and the outer core. However, to better understand the structure of the Earth and its layers, it's crucial to dive into more detail about the overall composition. The Earth is made up of four primary layers, namely the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. These layers vary in terms of their chemical composition, physical properties, and thickness. Let's take a closer look at each layer: 1. Crust: The Earth's crust forms the outermost layer and is composed of solid rocks and minerals. It ranges in thickness from about 5 kilometers beneath the ocean floor to approximately 70 kilometers beneath the continents. The crust is further classified into two types: the continental crust, which primarily consists of granitic rocks, and the oceanic crust, which is primarily composed of basaltic rocks. 2. Mantle: The mantle lies beneath the crust and is Earth's thickest layer, extending about 2,900 kilometers deep. Composed of solid and highly viscous silicate rocks, these rocks are denser than those found in the crust. The mantle is subdivided into two parts: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle, which is in contact with the crust, is relatively cooler and more rigid. In contrast, the lower mantle is hotter and exhibits plastic-like behavior due to the high temperature and pressure. 3. Outer Core: The outer core begins at a depth of around 2,900 kilometers and extends down to approximately 5,150 kilometers. Unlike the crust and mantle, the outer core is composed of mostly liquid iron and nickel, with some lighter elements such as oxygen and sulfur. The high temperatures within this layer cause the metals to remain in a molten state. The movement of the liquid outer core and Earth's rotation generate the planet's magnetic field. 4. Inner Core: Earth's inner core lies at a depth of around 5,150 kilometers and has a radius of about 1,220 kilometers. It is composed primarily of solid iron and nickel, with traces of lighter elements such as sulfur and oxygen. Despite being hotter than the outer core, the immense pressure at this depth keeps the inner core in a solid state. The solidification of the inner core is a result of pressure-induced solidification, a process in which higher pressure forces particles closer together, causing their ordered arrangement and the formation of a solid. In summary, the Earth's core has two main layers - the liquid outer core and the solid inner core. In the context of the entire Earth, there are four primary layers, including the crust and the mantle. Each layer serves a unique function and plays a vital role in shaping the properties and dynamics of our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton in 1920?  I was stationed on the Isle of Grain – a ghastly place but the first line of defence against invasion – and in our battalion of the Suffolks we had a number of professional musicians. So we formed an orchestra and played in the equivalent of the NAAFI during our spare time. I was the principal cello and we were conducted by the bandmaster, one Lieutenant Bonham. The other boys knew that I was longing to conduct and one day when Bonham fell ill with 'flu, they thought \\"old Barby\\" – as I was known – should have a go. It was really rather romantic – I was scrubbing the floor in the Officers' Mess when they came and invited me to take over. We did the Light Cavalry overture and Coleridge-Taylor's Petite Suite de Concert but I can't say I recall the rest of the programme. While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: \\"The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John.\\" After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the London Symphony Orchestra. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. The Musical Times commented, \\"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\\" At the Three Choirs Festival of 1920 he took part in his first Dream of Gerontius, under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet.

He had made up his mind to get this job done.  Question: How would you describe Taylor?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: a quitter  B: promising  C: steadfast A:","output":"The answer best suited according to the text would be C: steadfast. Here's why:  The context is indicating that Taylor is determined and persistent. Taylor has \\"made up his mind to get this job done\\", which suggests that he is firm in his decision and is not going to back down. This indicates a characteristic of being steadfast, which means resolutely or dutifully firm and unwavering. Now let's see why the other options were not suitable: A: a quitter - This would imply that Taylor tends to give up or quit, but there's nothing in the text indicating he's wanting or planning to stop, instead he's just getting started.  B: promising - To describe someone as promising usually implies that they show signs of future success. While Taylor's determination to complete the job does hint towards this, the text doesn't provide explicit indications about his potential for success, hence this might not be the best descriptor based on the information we have.  So once we've compared these characteristics to Taylor's behaviors from the text, C: steadfast was the most precise answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: A flowing stream contains water at 18°C. Cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into the stream. Which of the following will most likely occur?. Answer:","output":"When cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a flowing stream containing water at 18°C, several physical phenomena will likely occur. Some of the most prominent effects include heat transfer, temperature equilibrium, and possible changes to the stream's ecosystem. 1. Heat Transfer: The predominant occurrence in this situation is the transfer of heat between the soft drink cans and the water in the stream. Since the soft drinks are at a higher temperature (28°C) compared to the water in the stream (18°C), heat will transfer from the cans to the water until both reach a state of thermal equilibrium. 2. Conduction: The transfer of heat between the two substances will occur through the process of conduction. Conduction is the exchange of thermal energy between two adjacent materials in direct contact. In this case, the soft drink cans and the water in the stream are in direct contact, allowing thermal energy to flow from the higher-temperature cans to the lower-temperature water. 3. Temperature Equilibrium: Over time, the temperature of the soft drink cans and the stream water will approach equilibrium, at which point the rate of heat transfer between the two will slow and eventually stop. The final temperature of the soft drink cans and the water will be somewhere between 18°C and 28°C, depending on the specific heat capacities of the can materials, the soft drinks, and the water, as well as the mass ratios and the initial temperature difference. 4. Convection Currents: As the heat transfers from the cans to the water, local convection currents may form due to the changes in water density with temperature. Warmer water surrounding the cans will become less dense and rise, while cooler water nearby will sink, creating a natural circulation that promotes further heat transfer. 5. Changes to Stream Ecosystem: Although this is not a direct result of the temperature change, submerging cans of soft drinks in a stream could have potential consequences on the stream's environment. If the cans were not sealed properly, the contents might leak into the water, potentially introducing contaminants that could harm plant and animal life within the stream. 6. Thermal Shock: This phenomenon is not expected to occur in this case, as both the cans and the stream's water temperatures are not extreme enough to cause rapid or severe damage to the soft drink cans or the surrounding environment. However, if the temperature difference were significant, rapid heat transfer could lead to structural damage to the cans or even a rapid temperature change in the immediate vicinity that could be harmful to aquatic life. In conclusion, when cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into a stream containing water at 18°C, the most likely occurrence is heat transfer between the two until they reach temperature equilibrium. This process will happen through conduction, the direct exchange of thermal energy between substances in contact. Convection currents may form in the vicinity, promoting further heat transfer. Although unlikely, potential ecological impacts and thermal shock could also occur under specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which American musician, Walt Aldridge or Kurt Cobain is still alive and performing? Answer:","output":"Kurt Cobain was the lead singer and guitarist of the iconic American rock band, Nirvana. He was born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington. Unfortunately, Cobain passed away on April 5, 1994, in Seattle, at the age of 27. His death was a result of suicide, as he was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head. Consequently, he is not alive and performing today. On the other hand, Walt Aldridge is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer born on November 12, 1955, in Florence, Alabama. Aldridge gained prominence within the music industry primarily as a songwriter, having written numerous successful songs for various artists such as Reba McEntire, Travis Tritt, and Ronnie Milsap. As a performer, Aldridge has been involved in various projects and collaborations, and he released his first solo album, \\"Walt Aldridge – The Corner,\\" in 2017. Given the information above, it is evident that Walt Aldridge is the American musician who is still alive and involved in the music industry. Although his primary focus has been on songwriting and record production, his solo album and various collaborations demonstrate that he continues to perform as a musician. In contrast, Kurt Cobain, an influential figure in music history, tragically passed away in 1994, so he is no longer alive and performing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does Dreyfus suffer from? Movie title: The Pink Panther Strikes Again Movie plot: At a psychiatric hospital, former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is largely recovered from his obsession to kill the new Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Peter Sellers) and is about to be released when Clouseau, arriving to speak on Dreyfus' behalf, drives Dreyfus insane again. Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \\"doomsday weapon\\" in return for his daughter's freedom. Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain. The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian...

They started by playing local clubs which led to touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars opening shows and providing backup for major rock artists of the period. Their name was shortened to Exile in 1973, consisting of guitarist Pennington, leader/lead singer Jimmy Stokley, Bernie Faulkner B3 sax acoustic guitar, Billy Luxon trumpet, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, bassist Kenny Weir, and drummer Bobby Johns. The band changed musical styles throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. They shortened their name to Exile in 1973 and released their eponymous debut album through Wooden Nickel Records that same year. Singles released from the album proved unsuccessful, and it would be a good five years before the band released a full-length follow-up album.  In 1977, the band released the single \\"Try it On\\" on Atco Records, and it became a minor hit. The following year, Mike Chapman, an Australian who had established himself as a record producer in the UK, came to the United States in search of an experienced group who wrote their own material. Chapman heard an Exile demo and went to their next concert. Chapman evidently enjoyed what he saw. He and Exile decided to collaborate and together they produced the Mixed Emotions album on Warner/Curb Records. The first single release from that album was Kiss You All Over. The single reached Billboard's Top 40 on 5 August 1978. It remained on the chart for seventeen weeks and was No. 1 for four weeks in September. It was a best-seller for six months.  Their follow up single, \\"You Thrill Me,\\" also from the Mixed Emotions LP did not fare as well, although it did reach the Top 40 for one week on 3 February 1979. The band toured with Aerosmith, Heart, Dave Mason, Boston, Seals & Crofts and other hot pop acts of the late seventies throughout the United States, Europe and Africa.  All There Is, the group's second Warner Bros. Records album, recorded a year later with a distinct disco beat, yielded a foreign hit, \\"The Part Of Me That Needs You Most.\\" This single did particularly well in Europe and South Africa. Don't Leave Me This Way, their third album, produced by Peter Coleman, yielded two more singles, \\"Take Me Down\\" and \\"Smooth Sailing.\\" Once again, it did well in Europe and South Africa although their popularity in the United States waned.  Numerous personnel changes took place in 1979. Perhaps most significantly, Stokley would leave the group that year, forcing remaining members guitarist/vocalist J.P. Pennington, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, keyboardist/vocalist Marlon Hargis, bassist/vocalist Sonny Lemaire and drummers Steve Goetzman and Gary Freeman to search for a new lead singer. A young singer, Les Taylor, accepted an invitation to join the group and shared lead vocal duties with Pennington. By the early 1980s, other lineup changes took place, including the exit of original member Buzz Cornelison, plus keyboardist Mark Gray, who co-wrote \\"The Closer You Get\\" and \\"Take Me Down\\", both of which became hits for the group Alabama, played a short stint from 1980 to 1982.

Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity.

Short movie review: of cliches  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic's review titled \\"Of Clichés\\" seems to express a negative sentiment about the movie in question. Although the title itself doesn't explicitly state whether the critic views the movie positively or negatively, the term \\"cliché\\" generally carries a negative connotation. In film critique, clichés often refer to overused, hackneyed, or predictable elements within a movie that can ultimately create a lack of originality or novelty. When a movie is criticized for being clichéd, it may indicate that the movie borrows heavily from previously successful films or that it recycles common tropes and character archetypes rather than taking the time to develop a fresh, unique storyline. A critic is more likely to mention cliché elements in a review if it is being presented as a negative attribute, indicating a lack of innovation. Moreover, the short movie review alludes to the critic's disappointment in its inability to differentiate itself from other films in its genre or offer anything new or exciting for the audience to experience. Considering the critic’s focus on clichés, it can be inferred that the review likely mentions other shortcomings as well. These may include underdeveloped character arcs, superficial or one-dimensional characters, forced relationships, uninspired plot twists, or poor pacing. In conclusion, the critic's review titled \\"Of Clichés\\" suggests a negative opinion about the movie, primarily emphasizing the film's lack of originality, its heavy reliance on overused elements, and its inability to set itself apart from other films within its genre. Even though the provided information doesn't offer a comprehensive analysis of the critic’s thoughts, the indication of clichés and the manner in which they are presented strongly supports the implication of a negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"Select from: a.

Her most famous works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928), and the book-length essay A Room of One's Own (1929), with its famous dictum, \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\\"Main  body My dear, 'Dearest, I feel certain I am going mad again.

Been here twice and had horrible service each time. First time, we waited 45 minutes before a server came to our table to get our drink order. We had to get up and flag someone down.

Here's my take: The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) on the coattails of the ones who know everything. He has been running for too long. This time, it ends. The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, awesome writing, fantastic direction, suspense, and some of the best action of the summer. Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date.

The audience was loving it. The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift-wrapped package. All of the goods and then some. This is, in my opinion the best movie this summer.

Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project.

Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to decipher the code at the pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon drowns and apparently dies. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm and leaves her to bleed to death then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in and are able to save Katherine's life. After a near-death experience, Langdon is revealed to have survived due to the \`\`water'' in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon and Simkins race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word--the unpronounceable circumpunct--out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). With tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's skylight, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer.

In talks: Illegal immigrants living in 'beds in sheds' are desperate to leave Britain and return home, Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, has said. Illegal immigrants living in ‘beds in sheds’ are desperate to leave Britain and return home, an ethnic minority leader says. Gurmel Singh-Kandola, secretary-general of the Sikh Council, said many arrivals from India who had entered the country unlawfully were stuck here, unable to work, and wanted help from the Home Office to go back. His support for a ‘voluntary returns process’ echoes Home Office efforts to persuade some of the estimated one million illegal immigrants in Britain to leave of their own accord. His organisation is now in talks with the department over how migrants with no right to remain might contact officials  for help to return voluntarily. His remarks are in stark contrast to the fury provoked by the poster campaign among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. The posters were mounted on vans driven around parts of London, and stating: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’ A text number was provided for advice and help with travel documents. An investigation into whether they were ‘offensive and irresponsible’ was launched yesterday by the Advertising  Standards Authority. The watchdog said it had  received 60 complaints about the posters including that they were ‘reminiscent of slogans used by  racist groups to attack immigrants in the past’. Mr Singh-Kandola believes the message behind the posters could have been delivered ‘more softly’. ‘If it said something like, “If you want to go home contact this number” or “assistance is available to return home” I think it would have been the same message but delivered more softly,’ he said. Many from the Punjab and Delhi were stuck here, impoverished and unable to work, he said. Controversial: This poster campaign caused fury among human rights advocates, refugee groups and left-wing politicians. ‘Their plight is well known; they are sleeping very rough under bridges and in multiple occupancies, sometimes in sheds in the back of people’s gardens. 'We have been quite concerned about the abject poverty in which they are  living. Many of them have been trafficked by unscrupulous agents who take a lot of money from them.’ Many illegal immigrants destroyed their passport once they arrived in the country,  Mr Singh-Kandola said, making it difficult for them to go home even if they wanted to. It could take six or seven months to get replacement documents  papers from the Indian consulate, he said. The Home Office could help them obtain a new passport quickly and buy them a flight home. ‘Our discussions have been for those who want to go back home to facilitate that process in a humane and generous way.’ He said illegal immigrants were victims of ‘hype’ which led them to believe they could live and work in Britain once they arrived. ‘In fact they are stuck. They want to go home on a voluntary basis and what we need is processes to facilitate that.’ Raid: An Uzbekistani man who is said to have. overstayed his visa was detained by UK Border Agency officers in a raid. on a busy central London restaurant on Thursday. Officials said the £10,000 cost of the poster campaign would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home because of the cost of enforced removals. Yesterday, Eric Pickles became the first senior Tory to raise doubts about the use of the vans, and said they should be rolled-out nationwide only if it could be proved they work. The Communities Secretary said: ‘I will be looking at that evidence. I need to see some very persuasive evidence that this should be passed out nationally. If something like this has to happen it needs to be evidence-based.’ The Communities Secretary is cracking down on traveller sites which ‘trash’ the countryside, with new guidance to councils on removing illegal camps. Prepared: The UK Border Agency sent three vans to Soho to seize the employee. Mr Pickles said £60million was being made available to local authorities to help them act more quickly to shut down unauthorised encampments. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘We inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and I do. ‘The idea that this is somehow an attack on the traveller community is not true. This is a very good deal for travellers.’ His department hopes the guidance will give local residents a stronger voice in getting authorities to take action against illegal camps, and prevent incidents like the £7million clear-out of Dale Farm in 2011 after a 10-year wrangle. Highlights:","output":"1. Gurmel Singh-Kandola, Secretary-General of the Sikh Council, stated that many illegal immigrants living in 'beds in sheds' in the UK are desperate to return to their home countries, particularly those from India who cannot work and are living in difficult conditions. 2. Mr. Singh-Kandola supports a voluntary returns process and is currently in discussion with the Home Office to facilitate this process for migrants without permission to remain in the UK. 3. The Home Office has made efforts to persuade illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily, such as the controversial poster campaign on vans stating, \\"In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.\\" 4. This campaign was criticized by human rights advocates, refugee groups, and politicians, leading to an investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority. 5. Mr. Singh-Kandola suggested the campaign could have delivered its message \\"more softly,\\" such as offering assistance to those who want to return home. 6. Many illegal immigrants destroyed their passports upon arrival, making it difficult for them to return home. The Home Office could help them obtain new passports and flights. 7. The cost of the controversial poster campaign is £10,000, which officials claim would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home due to the high cost of enforced removals. 8. Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, stated that he would need \\"persuasive evidence\\" for the vans to be used nationally and that any action should be evidence-based. Pickles is also focusing on removing illegal traveler camps and providing £60 million to local authorities for this purpose. 9. The new guidelines for local authorities to tackle illegal camps aim to give local residents a stronger voice in urging authorities to take action against such encampments and avoid situations such as the 2011 Dale Farm clearance, which cost £7 million."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Jay wanted to fly like his dad","output":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Jay wanted to fly like his dad,\\" logically follows the preceding text.

Both Jay and his father attended the same air force school, and Jay's dedication to his training and eventual success as a fighter jet pilot for the United States Air Force further reinforces the idea that he aspired to follow in his father's footsteps. The sentence in question serves as a succinct expression of Jay's motivation for pursuing his goal by clearly stating his ambition to emulate his father's accomplishments in becoming a pilot. This motivation appears to be a central theme throughout the text, as evidenced by Jay's diligent efforts to excel in the academy and eventually achieve top honors in his class.

Review: that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The sentence provided appears to be a negative movie review. The main indicators of this sentiment arise from the use of specific descriptors and underlying tones. To begin with, the reviewer notes that the movie \\"no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers\\". This sentence fragment suggests that the film has, in some way, diverged from what is widely expected or desired by the viewing audience. By stating \\"no longer,\\" the reviewer is implying that there was a previous point in time when these needs were recognized, heightening the sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction. Further, the \\"needs of moviegoers\\" are referred to in the context of \\"real characters and compelling plots\\". This implies that these components are missing from the movie. \\"Real characters\\" suggests that the figures portrayed lack depth, authenticity, or relatability — all aspects that can significantly affect viewer engagement and empathy. \\"Compelling plots\\" often refer to storylines that are engaging, exciting, or thought-provoking. Thus, if the plot is not described as \\"compelling,\\" the reviewer is suggesting that it is lacking in interest or originality. Therefore, overall, the sentence gravitates heavily towards a negative review of the movie. This conclusion stems from the word choice and implications that suggest disappointment or disapproval, underscoring a lack of quality or enjoyment associated with the film. The reviewer is expressing that the movie doesn't meet the expectations or fulfill the desires of the audience which presumably makes it less enjoyable or satisfying to watch. To make the sentence a positive review, the reviewer could instead talk about how well the movie understands and represents what moviegoers want, or talk positively about the characters and plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In remarks during a ribbon-cutting ceremony here on Wednesday, Gov. George E. Pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the Hudson Valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory. He praised IBM for being \\"a critical partner in our economic development efforts\\" in New York state. In a brief speech, Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's chief executive, emphasized that it was important to make long-term investments despite the current slump in the technology business. \\"To play to win in technology, you innovate and you lead,\\" he said. But manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business. In June, IBM announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings. The largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage, which it sold to Hitachi, and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations. But Kelly said the demand for advanced chips, like those produced at IBM's facility in Burlington, Vt., is strong. \\"I need more capacity in that end of the market,\\" he said, \\"and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand.\\" If IBM has miscalculated the demand, it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the East Fishkill factory drag down earnings.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London. contains an answer for the question: How does Gail's husband give the information to Hector?, what is it ?

Magellan was born in northern Portugal in around 1480, either at Vila Nova de Gaia, near Porto, in Douro Litoral Province, or at Sabrosa, near Vila Real, in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. He was the son of Rodrigo de Magalhaes, Alcaide-Mor of Aveiro (1433-1500, son of Pedro Afonso de Magalhaes and wife Quinta de Sousa) and wife Alda de Mesquita and brother of Leonor or Genebra de Magalhaes, wife with issue of Joao Fernandes Barbosa.  In March 1505 at the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon. He participated in several battles, including the battle of Cannanore in 1506, where he was wounded. In 1509 he fought in the battle of Diu. He later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrao, his friend and possibly cousin. In September, after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrao, who had landed.  In 1511, under the new governor Afonso de Albuquerque, Magellan and Serrao participated in the conquest of Malacca. After the conquest their ways parted: Magellan was promoted, with a rich plunder and, in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, he returned to Portugal in 1512. Serrao departed in the first expedition sent to find the \\"Spice Islands\\" in the Moluccas, where he remained. He married a woman from Amboina and became a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.  After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco, he was wounded, resulting in a permanent limp. He was accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but he received no further offers of employment after 15 May 1514. Later on in 1515, he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected this. In 1517 after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east (i.e., while sailing westwards, seeking to avoid the need to sail around the tip of Africa), he left for Spain. In Seville he befriended his countryman Diogo Barbosa and soon married the daughter of Diogo's second wife, Maria Caldera Beatriz Barbosa. They had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhaes and Carlos de Magalhaes, both of whom died at a young age. His wife died in Seville around 1521.  Meanwhile, Magellan devoted himself to studying the most recent charts, investigating, in partnership with cosmographer Rui Faleiro, a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.

In practice, most designations occur several years after listing. Between 1978 and 1986 the FWS regularly designated critical habitat. In 1986 the Reagan Administration issued a regulation limiting the protective status of critical habitat. As a result, few critical habitats were designated between 1986 and the late 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of court orders invalidated the Reagan regulations and forced the FWS and NMFS to designate several hundred critical habitats, especially in Hawaii, California and other western states. Midwest and Eastern states received less critical habitat, primarily on rivers and coastlines. As of December, 2006, the Reagan regulation has not yet been replaced though its use has been suspended. Nonetheless, the agencies have generally changed course and since about 2005 have tried to designate critical habitat at or near the time of listing. What is the time limit for designating a species critical habitat after the species has been added to the endangered list?","output":"The time limit for designating a species' critical habitat after the species has been added to the endangered list is within one year, as stated in the ESA (Endangered Species Act)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Triglidae, commonly known as sea robins or gurnard, are a family of bottom-feeding scorpaeniform fish. They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish.  - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu.  - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg.

Write an article based on this \\"A Flintshire man who went on the run after raping a young child has been jailed for 12 years.\\"","output":"Title: Flintshire Man Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison for Raping a Young Child Introduction A recent disturbing case in Flintshire, UK has finally come to a conclusion as the man responsible for the heinous crime of raping a young child has been captured and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The man, who fled the scene shortly after committing the crime, was apprehended months later, providing the victim and their family an opportunity to finally seek justice. In this article, we will discuss the timeline of events, the legal proceedings, and the broader implications of such cases on society. Step 1: Establishing the timeline of events The Flintshire man, whose identity has been withheld to protect the victim's anonymity, committed the appalling act of raping a child earlier in the year. After the crime occurred, the man instantly went on the run to avoid being brought to justice. The local law enforcement agencies launched an extensive manhunt to locate the suspect and apprehend him. Step 2: Arresting the perpetrator Through coordinated efforts of the police, the community, and information provided by key witnesses, the Flintshire man was eventually found and arrested months after the incident took place. The apprehension of the suspect brought relief to the victim's family and the local community, who had been living in fear since the news of the brutal crime broke. Step 3: Legal proceedings and conviction Following the arrest, legal proceedings began, and the man was charged with rape of a minor. The trial, which was held in the Crown Court, saw the accused plead guilty and the jury subsequently found him guilty of the crime. The prosecution presented indisputable evidence, including the victim's testimony and forensic evidence that tied the defendant to the crime. As a result, the judge sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Step 4: Discussing the broader implications of such cases This shocking case brings a number of important issues to light. Firstly, the importance of the community and the law enforcement agencies working together cannot be understated. The swift action taken by the police and the assistance offered by members of the public were instrumental in apprehending the suspect. Secondly, the emotional and psychological trauma faced by the victim and their family is an aspect that should not be overlooked. Counseling and support services are essential in helping the victims cope with the aftermath of such atrocious crimes. Lastly, this case exposes the need for continued efforts to raise awareness on child sexual abuse, teach children about personal safety, and empower them to report any form of abuse. Furthermore, stricter sentencing guidelines and legal reforms may be necessary to deter potential offenders and ensure that justice is properly served. Conclusion The Flintshire man's 12-year prison sentence serves as a stark reminder of the consequences that sexual predators face when brought to justice. While no punishment can truly undo the devastating impact of this crime on the victim and their family, this case highlights the importance of law enforcement, community involvement, and legal recourse in dealing with such horrifying incidents. Society as a whole must ensure that we work together to prevent child sexual abuse, support the victims, and hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Modern vehicles may contain multiple airbag modules in various side and frontal locations of the passenger seating positions, and sensors may deploy one or more airbags in an impact zone at variable rates based on the type, angle and severity of impact; the airbag is designed to only inflate in moderate to severe frontal crashes.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"Yes, your statement provides a reasonable answer to the question of when airbags deploy in modern vehicles. To expand on your answer, airbags are designed to deploy during moderate to severe frontal crashes, as well as side and rollover crashes, depending on the specific airbag system in a vehicle. Modern vehicles often contain multiple airbag modules located throughout the passenger seating positions, providing a comprehensive safety system in the event of a collision. Airbag deployment is determined using various sensors, which monitor the type, angle, and severity of an impact. These sensors provide real-time information to the vehicle's airbag control unit (ACU). Based on the data received, the ACU will then determine if airbag deployment is necessary and, if so, which airbags it needs to deploy and at what inflation rate. In addition to frontal airbags, some vehicles are also equipped with side-impact airbags, curtain airbags, and knee airbags, among others, each designed to provide protection for specific areas of the vehicle in case of an accident. The precise moment of deployment depends on the signals received by the ACU, which makes a rapid assessment of the collision's characteristics. It is important to note that while airbags provide a vital safety feature in modern vehicles, they are not meant to replace seat belts. Instead, airbags are designed to work in conjunction with seat belts to offer maximum protection during an accident. Wearing a seat belt properly and sitting in an appropriate position in the vehicle are essential for both driver and passengers to ensure the effectiveness of airbags in the event of a collision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The current \\"opt-in\\" system requires a proactive choice by an individual to register to become an organ donor on their death. The Scottish government said it would examine the bill to see if a \\"convincing case\\" could be made for a move to an opt-out system. The new legislation would mean people would have to actively opt out or else their name would be added to the NHS Organ Donation Register. Under the terms of the \\"soft opt-out\\" system, families of deceased patients would be given a say on donation if they could confirm their relative had made an unrecorded objection during their lifetime. Ms McTaggart, who introduced the bill, cited evidence which said that three people died every day across the UK waiting for a transplant. She claimed her legislation could save lives. \\"That's what the bill is about. It's about making more organs available to people who need them, ultimately,\\" she said. According to the government, there has been a 63% increase in the number of transplants carried out on Scottish patients since 2007. Maureen Watt, minister for public health, said: \\"There is currently no consensus amongst experts as to whether this would make a significant difference and the international evidence is not clear. \\"However the Scottish government welcomes any debate in relation to the important issues of organ donation and transplantation.\\" Ms Watt added: \\"In Scotland we lead the UK in increasing donation and transplantation numbers. \\"The transplant waiting list is now at its lowest level to date. In addition, 41% of Scots are signed up to the NHS Organ Donor Register - the highest percentage of any of the four UK countries.\\" Ms McTaggart hosted an event at Parliament to mark the formal introduction of the bill, which was attended by representatives of a number of medical organisations including the British Medical Association (BMA), the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and the Scottish Kidney Federation, as well as transplant recipients and their families. Ms McTaggart said she was \\"delighted\\" with the event, and the introduction of the bill. \\"There's still a long way to go in the legislative process but I'm confident that the overwhelming evidence in favour of my proposals will ensure the success of my bill,\\" she said. Scottish TV presenter Lorraine Kelly, who had previously offered support, reiterated her backing for the bill via a video message where she stated that being an organ donor was a \\"unique opportunity for people to leave behind an amazing gift.\\" The BMA welcomed the publication of the bill. In a statement, Dr Sue Robertson, a member of the BMA's Scottish Council and a renal physician, said: \\"The whole transplant community works tremendously hard to increase the levels of organ donation with significant support from the Scottish government, but there are still people in Scotland waiting for an organ transplant. \\"We believe that more can be done and more lives can be saved and this bill represents a positive step towards that goal,\\" she added. The British Heart Foundation also backs the bill. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Anne McTaggart, a lady who works for the government, is trying to change the way people in Scotland become organ donors.

CNN followed one aid container from the headquarters of ShelterBox in Cornwall, England, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to see the hurdles aid groups face. Minutes after the earthquake struck on January 12, the ShelterBox crew sprang into action. The international disaster relief organization is the brainchild of Tom Henderson, who was recognized as a CNN Hero in 2008. \\"If you've lost everything as they have in Haiti, it's all about shelter, warmth, comfort and dignity,\\" says Henderson. \\"That's what ShelterBox is.\\" A ShelterBox container -- containing relief supplies including a 10-person tent, water and blankets -- is designed to be easily carried by two people and stackable for easy storage. To get to Haiti from Cornwall, the box went on four flights and one overland trip over five days before being distributed to a mother and her newborn baby. Once in the Dominican Republic -- Haiti's neighbor -- there were delays because of security concerns and a national holiday that meant local help was limited. The ShelterBox was one of 720 boxes eventually loaded into a four truck convoy in Santa Domingo for a U.N.-escorted drive to Haiti. The drive from Santo Domingo to the Haiti border took about 11 hours because of poor roads and a puncture. Twelve ShelterBoxes are being used to build an emergency field hospital at the airport, said Mark Pearson who is in Haiti for the charity. Each ShelterBox contains individual survival equipment like water carriers, a tool kit and a children's pack containing drawing books, crayons and pens. By February 1, Shelterbox hopes to have more than 7,000 boxes in Haiti, housing up to 70,000 people.

Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio.  The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio.  Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot.  After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad.  The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento.  After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca.  After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government.  Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor.  This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor.  Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

Article: In many romantic movies or TV shows one scene always appears. It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to  _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse.     You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively   and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches   to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices.     Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating   these vocalizations   are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: All eyes this week are on North Korea, which looks set to move forward with a provocative long-range missile launch. Last month, Pyongyang announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between Thursday and April 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founder, Kim Il Sung. Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch -- which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions -- as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. And a South Korean intelligence report says it's likely to precede a nuclear test, as it did in 2006 and 2009. Pyongyang insists its intentions are good and have invited foreign journalists, including CNN correspondent Stan Grant, to view the secret launch site. CNN on Monday interviewed Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on \\"Starting Point\\" to help explain the tense situation:. CNN: This whole parading the journalists through -- letting people see -- is this Kim Jong Un bragging internally? Is it sending a message to the international community? Both? Jim Walsh: It's a good question. Often when North Korea acts out, its purpose is to communicate with the broader world, communicate to the United States or to Japan or South Korea. This is really about internal messaging, being able to go to its own public and say, \\"Look, all these Western journalists are here, we're really important, we're really a big deal.\\" And why do I say it's internally driven? Because they are going through a political transition. This young guy, this 20-something-year-old, has taken over for his father (Kim Jong Il), and he's in the middle of trying to consolidate his position. And it's the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth. ... They've been planning big events for years now for this. So this is all about regime legitimacy and talking to the North Korean people and the military, the elites in the military. CNN: CNN saw what appears to be a satellite. I think most of the media there agree that there definitely is a satellite for this rocket, to launch this satellite into space. ... We also know that this is a country that has nuclear ambitions, no matter how nascent it is or successful it might be. Walsh: Yes, well, you know, this missile is not the greatest missile in the world. There are two characteristics if you have a modern missile program: One is solid fuel, and the other is a modern-guidance system. This missile has neither of those. And four tests, four long-range missile tests over like 15 years, is not a very active missile program. It's more like a tube filled with gasoline than it is anything else. The big worry is they're going to fire it up there, and it will get wobbly on them and start to veer off course like the last two did. That's the real concern I have: not the missile itself but that the missile might stray into foreign airspace and that Japan or South Korea might feel inclined to shoot it down and then suddenly we're off to the races with an international incident. CNN: Are we looking at a scenario where we're going to see a couple of missiles get launched or troops marching down to the (demilitarized zone)? Should people be legitimately scared about this? ... Walsh: Well, I think it is about trying to impress the family and the military. I don't think they're going to march a lot of people toward the DMZ. I think that would be provocative. Certainly, you could see other missile tests. That's a good question. They've done that in the past, short-range missiles. But I'm afraid what we're really looking at here, further down the road, is there's going to be the missile test, then there's going to be international reaction, and then (North Korea) is going to have to push back. So I would not rule out a nuclear test sometime later this year if this continues to ratchet up. CNN: This is obviously very provocative behavior by the North Koreans, even after there was just this highly publicized deal for food for this starving country. So what's the point? What are they trying to do? Walsh: That's the 100,000 question, and we really don't have an answer here. Now I know lot of people who have been following this over the years. They sort of think this is the same old, same old -- that we cut a deal and they've broken the deal; they got something, but they didn't live up to their promises. Well, that's not what's happening here. There was a deal, and we really hadn't given them anything yet. We haven't given them the food aid. So that tells me one (of) two things happened. Either there was some misunderstanding about the contents of that deal -- the Americans thought one thing, the North Koreans the other -- or maybe that deal got back to Pyongyang and then ran into trouble there. Maybe the military pushed back, or there was something else going on. But at this point, we don't know the reason. If we had an answer to that question, that would tell us what's going on inside North Korea. It's the most opaque society in the world -- more than Iran, more than any other place on Earth -- so we really don't know what's going on.","output":"The article discusses North Korea's intent to launch a long-range missile amid protests from the international community. The proposed launch is in direct violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and is seen as a prelude to a nuclear test, based on similar pattern observed in 2006 and 2009.  Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from MIT, weighs in on the situation with a series of incisive points. Firstly, he emphasizes that the move may be tied to internal messaging, aimed at boosting the image of the country's leadership to its citizens, rather than an outward act of aggression. This analysis is buttressed by the fact that the launch coincides with the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung, and comes in the wake of a political transition following the recent ascension of Kim Jong Un. Secondly, Walsh notes that the missile being prepared for launch is relatively archaic and primitive. The fear is not regarding the successful deployment of the missile itself, but rather the possibility that it could veer off course, potentially provoking retaliatory action from Japan or South Korea, hence escalating the situation. Thirdly, touching on conjecture about a potential military march towards the demilitarized zone or further missile launches, Walsh reassures that while there could be more missile tests, a march towards the DMZ seems unlikely as it would be too provocative. However, he indicates that a nuclear test may not be off the table, dependent on the severity of the international reaction. Lastly, Walsh gives his perspective on North Korea's actions which appear to counter the recent food aid agreement aimed at relieving the country's famine. He suggests two possible reasons: a misunderstanding about the deal or internal resistance when the agreement reached North Korea.  Overall, the article illustrates the strategic opacity of North Korea's moves and the high level of concern from the international community regarding the country's visible flirtation with provocative actions. The MIT analyst's insights reinforce the intricacies of North Korea's geopolitical positioning, making clear that an understanding of these actions requires careful consideration of both internal dynamics and international implications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Among the animals, there was a squirrel, a rabbit, and a small bird. They seemed to be having an important conversation. As the guard tried to listen carefully, he could hear the squirrel say, \\"We need to find a way to keep our homes safe from the humans. They keep destroying our homes.\\" The guard, feeling sad for the animals, decided he wanted to help them. He stepped out from behind the bushes and said, \\"Hello, little friends! I heard your conversation, and I want to help you keep your homes safe.\\" The animals were surprised but happy that the guard wanted to help them. They explained that humans were cutting down trees and building homes where their old ones were, leaving them with nowhere to go. So, the guard thought very hard and came up with a plan. He told the animals, \\"I will speak to the other guards and people, telling them how important it is to take care of your homes and not destroy them. We can also put up signs to show other humans which trees your homes are in so they won't cut them down.\\" The animals were very grateful for the guard's help and agreed with his plan. The next day, the guard talked to everyone he could about protecting the animal's homes and putting up signs. Soon, more and more people began to understand the importance of helping these little animals too. Together, the guard and the people created safe places for the squirrel, the rabbit, and the bird. They also shared what they had learned with other people in the area.

This increase in blood lipid levels may lead to health problems such as cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Group B followed a more balanced diet with fewer fats, thus reducing the risks associated with a high-fat diet and maintaining a healthier lipid profile in their blood. However, it is essential to note that actual lipid levels would depend on individual body's responses, physical activity levels, genetic factors, and other lifestyle habits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: In the Netherlands,cycling isn't seen as eccrfriendly exercise; it's part of everyday life, as it's people's top choice to school and work. There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands. In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike. So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling net- work in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes, where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words \\"Bike Street:Cars are guests\\". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18,cycling offers Dutch teen- agers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are ubiquitous in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands,for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes. What does the Dutch government do about teenagers cycling? A) It makes cycling covered by school education. B) It encourages teenagers to cycle alone. C) It will watch over teenagers who ride bikes. D) It suggests teenagers cycling before driving. Answer:","output":"A) It makes cycling covered by school education."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked.

Medical exams indicate that the cancer has not spread to her lymph nodes or grown beyond the thyroid gland, he said.      Doctors are scheduled to operate on Fernandez on January 4. She will take a medical leave and relinquish power to the South American nation's vice president from January 4-24, Scoccimarro said.

Her husband, Nestor Kirchner, was president from 2003-2007. He died in October 2010.      During Fernandez's presidency, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually.      Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has an excellent survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.      More than 95% of adults with papillary thyroid carcinoma survive at least 10 years, according to a description on the library's website. Treatment includes surgery, radioactive iodine and medication, the library says.      Possible complications in surgery can include damage to a nerve that controls the vocal cords or accidental removal of a gland that helps regulate blood calcium levels, according to the medicine library.      Recently doctors have diagnosed several South American leaders with cancer.      Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010.      Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that doctors had diagnosed him with cancer in June. He did not specify what kind of cancer he had, but after undergoing several rounds of chemotherapy, he said in October that he had been cured.      Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is undergoing treatment for throat cancer. ||||| Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gestures during a ceremony outside the Casa Rosada Presidential Palace in Buenos Aires December 10, 2011.      BUENOS AIRES |      BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine President Cristina Fernandez has thyroid cancer and will undergo surgery next month, her government said on Tuesday, adding that the cancerous cells had not spread.      Fernandez, 58, was easily elected to a second four-year term in October, vowing to deepen her unorthodox policies despite complaints from business leaders who say her heavy-handed management of the economy is stifling investment.      Fernandez was diagnosed with a papillary carcinoma that has not metastasized, said her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro. The operation is scheduled to take place on January 4 and she is expected to take a leave of absence until January 24.      \\"The thyroid gland will have to be removed,\\" said Buenos Aires-based cancer specialist Julio Moreno. \\"The prognosis is very good. The chances of being cured are 90 to 98 percent.\\"      The cancer was detected last week during a routine check. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and normally affects people under the age of 40, especially women.      A skilled orator fond of glamorous clothes, high heels and make-up, Fernandez still wears black as she mourns her husband and closest advisor, former President Nestor Kirchner, who died late last year.      When Kirchner died, many thought it spelled the end of the couple's idiosyncratic blend of state intervention, nationalist rhetoric and the championing of human rights in grains exporting powerhouse Argentina, the world's No. 3 soybean supplier.      But Fernandez pulled off a remarkable comeback on the back of a brisk economic expansion and an outpouring of public sympathy. She was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, promising to stay true to her policies despite objections from Wall Street and international investors.      Latin America's No. 3 economy is growing at nearly 9 percent a year. But a worsening global economic outlook combined with entrenched high inflation at home are seen reining in Argentina's growth to about 4 percent next year.      Fernandez is one of several Latin American leaders to have cancer. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez underwent chemotherapy earlier this year while Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo's lymphatic cancer is in remission.      And former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is being successfully treated for a cancerous tumor on his Larynx, according to his doctors.

The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \\"The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and, ... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons).\\" This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one’s identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one’s development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual. Do a teen's friends have a large or small impact on their social development?","output":"A teen's friends have a large impact on their social development.

Article:County Down swimmer Firth, 20, won the S14 100m backstroke title when representing Ireland four years ago but will be among four Northern Irish competitors competing for Great Britain in Rio. Larne woman Claire Taggart, 21, competes in Boccia for Britain with 16-year-old Ballymena youngster Katie Morrow (wheelchair basketball) and Downpatrick man David Leavy (seven-a-side football) also representing Great Britain at the Games. Track and field stars McKillop and Smyth are joined in the Ireland team by seven-a-side footballers Ryan Walker and Cormac Birt plus Dungannon shooter Phillip Eaglesham. Here, BBC Sport takes a more detailed look at the Northern Ireland competitors. Seaforde woman Firth will aim to land gold during Thursday's first day of competition when she defends her S14 100m backstroke title. The 100m backstroke remains Firth's strongest event but she will also compete in the 200m freestyle, 100m breaststroke and 200m individual medley later in the Games. Firth could be a strong gold medal contender in the 200m IM on the penultimate day of the Games as Russian Valeriia Shabalina, who pipped her for gold at this year's European Championships, will not be competing because of the country's ban from Rio. Firth, who competes in the S14 classes for swimmers with an intellectual disability, is one of Northern Ireland's top pool stars and competed in eight events at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. After winning gold in London, Firth won three silver medals at the IPC World Championships in Montreal a year later before opting to switch allegiance to Great Britain. Twenty-one-year-old Larne woman Claire Taggart competes in the Paralympic-specific spot of Boccia, which is similar to Boules and requires major tactical nuance and accuracy from its athletes. Claire was diagnosed with the condition dystonia after beginning to experience difficulties with her walking five years ago. Media playback is not supported on this device But despite now being in a wheelchair, the county Antrim woman maintains a hugely positive approach to life. \\"I'm learning to drive again. The only thing I can't do is walk and to be honest, I'm not that bothered,\\" says Claire. The Larne woman was thrilled by her selection for her first Paralympics and will be part of a strong British squad expected to challenge strongly for medals in both the team and individual events. Downpatrick man David Leavy will be another Paralympics debutant in Rio after being named in Britain's seven-a-side football squad. The Queen's University student captained the Northern Ireland team at last year's Cerebral Palsy World Championships after discovering the sport when watching the London 2012 Paralympics on television. Leavy will be the first ever Northern Ireland player to represent Great Britain in seven-a-side football at a Paralympics. \\"It's a real honour to be selected to represent ParalympicsGB and I'm delighted that all of my hard work in training has paid off,\\" says the 24-year-old. Sixteen-year-old Ballymena girl Katie Morrow was introduced to wheelchair basketball three years ago by Disability Sport Northern Ireland's Wheelchair Basketball Performance Officer Phil Robinson. 2015 was a remarkable year for the Cullybackey College student as she helped the British senior team win European Championship bronze after making her debut earlier in the season, in addition to helping the British Under-25 squad clinch World Championship gold. Away from the basketball court, Katie is a highly talented swimmer having been a club-mate of Ireland star Danielle Hill in a Larne squad which claimed relay medals at Irish and British Age-Group Championships. The world's fastest Paralympian will be aiming to win gold medal number five in Rio after his T13 sprint doubles in Beijing and London. With the International Paralympic Committee dropping the 200m event from the Rio athletics programme, Eglinton man Smyth will run just the 100m at these Games with his opening heat taking place on the first day of competition on Thursday before Friday's final. Media playback is not supported on this device Smyth, 29, set world records of 10.46 and 21.05 as he triumphed in London although his 100m personal best of 10.22 set in 2011 was good enough to earn him a place in the sprint entry alongside Usain Bolt at that year's World Championships in South Korea. Injury problems affected Smyth in the three years after London but his 10.39 clocking in Florida earlier this summer suggests that he should comfortably retain his 100m title. As an eight-year-old, Smyth was diagnosed with the genetic condition Stargardt's Disease, which has left him with less than 10% of normal vision. Like his great friend Smyth, Glengormley runner McKillop will be unable to repeat his double triumph of four years ago after Games bosses also opted to remove the T37 800m from the Rio timetable. Despite a series of injuries since London, which included a broken wrist after he fell off a bike while on holiday in Rome, McKillop has remained unbeatable at world and European level over the last four years. McKillop has not lost in Paralympic competition since a defeat at the 2005 European Championships in Finland, which came three years before his first Paralympics gold medal in Beijing. With the 26-year-old enjoying an injury-free 2016, he will be a strong favourite to clinch a fourth Paralympics gold medal. Nineteen-year-old Armagh man Ryan Walker will make his Paralympic debut on Friday when he lines out for the Ireland seven-a-side football team in their opener against the world's top-ranked team Ukraine at the Deodoro Stadium. The tournament, which is played by footballers with cerebral palsy, will continue for the Irish on Saturday as they face hosts Brazil before they face Great Britain in their final group match. Midfielder Ryan, who hails from Glenanne in county Armagh, has been playing football all his life and is a regular with his Ireland team-mate Cormac Birt and British representative David Leavy in the Northern Ireland team. Ryan hopes to qualify as a personal trainer in the future. Toomebridge 20-year-old Cormac Birt will make his Ireland debut in Rio after being named alongside Walker in the 14-man squad. A former GAA player, Cormac turned his hand to football in 2011 and hasn't looked back since and has been juggling training with his studies as an accountancy student. The county Antrim man has been capped 34 times by Northern Ireland's Cerebral Palsy team and his seven international goals include a wonder strike from the halfway line against England three years ago. Belfast youngster Jordan Walker, 17, was selected to join Walker and Birt in the Ireland squad but had to pull out because of injury. Dungannon man Phillip Eaglesham was serving as a Royal Marine in Afghanistan in 2010 when he contracted Q Fever, a rare airborne bacteria, and the steady deterioration in his condition left him wheelchair bound. However, the father-of-three took began competing in disability shooting competitions in 2012 and despite the constant struggle to manage the physical and mental impact of his illness, he competed in his first IPC World Cup event in the USA in 2015. Media playback is not supported on this device Impressive performances at the World Cup competition in Thailand in March secured the Somerset-based 34-year-old his selection on the Ireland team for Rio. \\"There is no real prognosis apart from deterioration so we don't know where the future lies, but sport has really given me an outlook on doing something positive,\\" says Phillip.

Article: A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe. Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvotn different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 metres thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer  of water between glacier and the volcano, keeping it stable. As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava  from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what is happening today. Now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. According to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp, glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them eating ash-covered grass or the sharp objects.

Solve this instance: the turtle hid in its shell because it was afraid of what might happen to it Student:","output":"Part #1: Identify two sentences separated by \\"because\\". Usage: The first sentence is \\"The turtle hid in its shell,\\" and the second sentence is \\"it was afraid of what might happen to it.\\" I found these sentences because they are separated by the word \\"because.\\" Part #2: Decide if the first sentence can be the result of the second sentence. Usage: The first sentence, \\"The turtle hid in its shell,\\" can be the result of the second sentence, \\"it was afraid of what might happen to it.\\" This is because hiding in its shell is a reasonable reaction for a turtle when it is afraid of something. Part #3: Determine if there is a possible cause and effect relationship. Usage: There is a possible cause and effect relationship in this instance because the fear mentioned in the second sentence (the cause) could directly lead to the turtle's action of hiding in its shell in the first sentence (the effect). Part #4: Answer with \\"plausible\\" or \\"not plausible\\" based on the relationship. Usage: Plausible. I think it is plausible because I found a clear cause (fear) and effect (hiding in its shell) relationship in the given sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Explanation: A producer is something that creates energy and sugar through a process called photosynthesis. In an ecosystem, this is usually done by plants. Out of the available options here, strawberries are a plant. That's why they are the producer. Now, let's see why other options are wrong:  * cloudy mornings - This is a part of weather and doesn't produce energy or sugar.  * vinyl - This is a type of plastic material, not a living organism, so it's not a producer.  * team Alicia - This sounds like a group of people, and people don't create energy through photosynthesis like plants do."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Napoleon In the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the Allies exiled him to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean, 20 km (12 mi) off the Tuscan coast.

Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he had carried after nearly being captured by the Russians during the retreat from Moscow. Its potency had weakened with age, however, and he survived to be exiled while his wife and son took refuge in Austria.

Movie plot title: The Scarlet Pumpernickel Movie plot: The cartoon is a story-within-a-story. Daffy Duck is fed up with comedy and wants to try a dramatic act instead. He offers a script to the Warner Brothers executive \\"J.L.\\", called The Scarlet Pumpernickel, which he wrote himself (under the name \\"Daffy Dumas Duck.\\") As Daffy reads the script to J.L., the cartoon cuts away to various scenes and then back to J.L.'s office. Each time, Daffy announces a page number. By the cartoon's end, the script has exceeded 2 thousand pages (movie scripts much in excess of 100 pages were usually rejected as too long back in those days). In this script, the clumsy Scarlet Pumpernickel (Daffy) must save the Fair Lady Melissa from being married to a man she does not love, the Grand Duke (Sylvester) under the Lord High Chamberlain's (Porky Pig) orders. Melissa loves Scarlet, but her happy mood is extinguished in a heartbeat when the Chamberlain orders her to \\"Keep away from that masked band-d-d-d-d-a-desperand-d-d-d-d-that masked stinker!\\" The Chamberlain gets a brilliant plan and decides to marry Melissa to the Grand Duke in exchange for killing the Scarlet Pumpernickel. As planned, the Scarlet Pumpernickel is drawn to town to interrupt the wedding. He arrives disguised as a noble and uses the disguise to research and develop his plan for rescuing Melissa. Storming the wedding ceremony through the use of a \\"ye olde Olympic Highjumper (a pin and a jab in the posterior) as she is walking up the aisle, he is instantly successful as Melissa tears herself from her father's arms and runs from the chapel, dragging Scarlet with her (\\"So what's to save?\\").

Answer: Twenty-one percent of the total area of Guro District is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt with the only arboretum in Seoul. Question: WHERE IS GOCHEOK DONG  BRANCH A:","output":"To answer the question, it is essential to first break it down and then provide a step-by-step justification for the answer. Step 1: Understand the given information and question The initial information provided states that 21% of the total area of Guro District in Seoul is a restricted zone to be used as a greenbelt, and it is the only arboretum in the city. The question being asked is about the location of Gocheok-dong Branch. Step 2: Identify Gocheok-dong Gocheok-dong is a neighborhood in Guro District, Seoul, South Korea. Step 3: Determine whether Gocheok-dong's location is connected to the greenbelt information The critical part here is to determine whether the location of Gocheok-dong Branch relates to the information about the greenbelt. It is reasonable to assume that the user might be referring to a branch facility or an office located within the Gocheok-dong neighborhood. Step 4: Answer the question considering the connection between the greenbelt information and Gocheok-dong Branch Since the initial information provided is about the greenbelt area within the Guro District, it doesn't offer any insights into the precise location of the Gocheok-dong Branch within the neighborhood. Therefore, the answer to the question—where Gocheok-dong Branch is—cannot be adequately addressed using the provided information about the Guro District's greenbelt area.  Answer: The information provided about Guro District's greenbelt area does not help in determining the location of Gocheok-dong Branch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Why did the twins sell the house? - It was too large for the two of them. - Neither wanted to set a foot it in again. - So they could invest in other real estate. - not enough information A:","output":"The twins sold the house because neither of them wanted to set foot in it again. This reason is directly stated in the information provided.

Sentence 2: Since getting a new accountant, it was easier for him to see where his money was going. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. These two sentences present different scenarios and do not necessarily relate directly to one another. Let's break down each sentence and analyze its content. Sentence 1: \\"The sight of his money flowing liberally unnerved him deeply, even when it flowed to something he valued.\\" This sentence conveys an emotional response to a situation where the individual's money is being spent freely and without restraint. The person is described as feeling unnerved, even when the money is being spent on something he values. This sentence focuses on the emotional state of a person who witnesses their money being spent liberally, regardless of the recipient or whether the expenditure aligns with their values. Sentence 2: \\"Since getting a new accountant, it was easier for him to see where his money was going.\\" In this sentence, the main focus is on a recent change (i.e., getting a new accountant) that has made it easier for the individual to understand and track their financial transactions. This sentence emphasizes the change in visibility and general awareness of the person's spending habits rather than their emotional response to it. Based on the content of these two sentences, they do not directly relate to one another. The first sentence focuses on the emotional response to liberal spending and does not mention the role of an accountant, while the second sentence centers on the improved ability to track spending due to a new accountant without discussing any emotional reactions. Consequently, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as they each address distinct aspects of financial management and personal reactions to spending."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Belgium has a lower biodiversity, while France's biodiversity is much higher.  Which country had more species of animals disappear? The answer is:","output":"Based on the information provided, France has a higher biodiversity compared to Belgium. Generally, higher biodiversity means there are more species of animals, plants, and other organisms in a particular country. However, the question asks about the number of species that have disappeared or gone extinct in each country. Unfortunately, we cannot directly infer the number of animal extinctions from the given information about biodiversity levels alone. To answer this question specifically, we would need actual data on species extinctions in Belgium and France. However, it is important to note that countries with higher biodiversity usually have more species that could potentially be at risk of extinction due to various factors, such as habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. So, it is possible that France might have experienced a higher number of species loss compared to Belgium, simply because they have more species to begin with. Nonetheless, without concrete data on extinctions, we cannot make a definitive conclusion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Buttler was dropped for Jonny Bairstow during the 2-0 Test series defeat by Pakistan, but hit a 46-ball century as England won the one-day series 3-1. Both wicketkeepers are in the squad for this winter's tour of South Africa. \\"He's such a talent that I'm sure he'll be able to adapt his game to the longer form,\\" said Bayliss of Buttler, 25. The Lancashire player has a strike-rate of 117.26 runs per 100 balls faced in one-day cricket and has scored England's three fastest one-day centuries. However, he went 22 international innings without scoring a half-century, between his 66-ball ton against New Zealand in June and his 52-ball 116 against Pakistan on Friday. Since making his Test debut against India in July 2014, where he hit his highest score of 85, Buttler has compiled five half-centuries in scoring 630 runs at an average of 30. Against Pakistan, he scored just 34 runs in four innings, after a summer in which he notched 122 in eight knocks against Australia. Yorkshire's Bairstow, who has a highest score of 95 and averages 26.40, played six successive Tests as a specialist batsman before taking over behind the stumps for the third Test in Sharjah. Asked whether Buttler may return as first-choice wicketkeeper for the first Test against South Africa in Durban on 26 December, Bayliss said: \\"It's something for us to think about. \\"There's got to be a spot available for him, as well. It'll certainly be spoken about, I'm sure.\\" Bayliss believes Buttler may benefit from replicating his attacking one-day style in the Test arena, although he concedes it would take significant commitment from both the player and coaching staff. \\"He probably could,\\" said Bayliss. \\"Whether he would allow himself to actually do it and whether we can get our head around actually playing like a Twenty20 innings in a Test match, I'm not sure.\\" What is a summary of this text?","output":"This is about two cricket players, Buttler and Jonny Bairstow.

Background: Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dali i Domenech, Marquis of Dali de Pubol (11 May 1904 - 23 January 1989), known professionally as Salvador Dali ( Catalan: [s@lb@'do d@'li]; Spanish: [salba'dor da'li]), was a prominent Spanish surrealist born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. Dali was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. Context: Dali employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, the hallmark \\"melting watches\\" that first appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed. The idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to Dali when he was staring at a runny piece of Camembert cheese on a hot August day.  The elephant is also a recurring image in Dali's works. It appeared in his 1944 work Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening. The elephants, inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk, are portrayed \\"with long, multijointed, almost invisible legs of desire\\" along with obelisks on their backs. Coupled with the image of their brittle legs, these encumbrances, noted for their phallic overtones, create a sense of phantom reality. \\"The elephant is a distortion in space\\", one analysis explains, \\"its spindly legs contrasting the idea of weightlessness with structure.\\" \\"I am painting pictures which make me die for joy, I am creating with an absolute naturalness, without the slightest aesthetic concern, I am making things that inspire me with a profound emotion and I am trying to paint them honestly.\\" --Salvador Dali, in Dawn Ades, Dali and Surrealism.  The egg is another common Daliesque image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love; it appears in The Great Masturbator and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus. The Metamorphosis of Narcissus also symbolized death and petrification. There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at Dali's house in Port Lligat as well as at the Dali Theatre and Museum in Figueres.  Various other animals appear throughout his work as well: ants point to death, decay, and immense sexual desire; the snail is connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts are a symbol of waste and fear.  Both Dali and his father enjoyed eating sea urchins, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaques. The radial symmetry of the sea urchin fascinated Dali, and he adapted its form to many art works. Other foods also appear throughout his work. Question: What type of symbolism did Dali use? Answer:","output":"Salvador Dali used extensive symbolism in his artworks, often drawing inspiration from various sources like science, religion, and personal experiences. Some prominent types of symbolism used by Dali include: 1. Melting clocks: Representing the relativity of time and influenced by Einstein's theory. This symbol first appeared in \\"The Persistence of Memory.\\" 2. Elephants: Inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture in Rome, they symbolize desire and are often depicted with long, multijointed legs, creating a sense of phantom reality and distortion in space. 3. Eggs: Associated with prenatal and intrauterine themes, symbolizing hope and love. They appear in works such as \\"The Great Masturbator\\" and \\"The Metamorphosis of Narcissus.\\" 4. Animals: Various animals like ants (symbolizing death, decay, and sexual desire), snails (connected to the human head), and locusts (representing waste and fear) are present in Dali's works. 5. Sea urchins: Fascinated by their radial symmetry, Dali incorporated sea urchins into his art, drawing inspiration from his experiences with his father and their fondness for eating freshly caught sea urchins. Thus, Dali's symbolism is a vivid and imaginative blend of personal memories, emotions, and experiences, often incorporating elements of science, nature, and art history."},{"instruction":"Question: Who announce their love for each other and decide to marry?

They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies. The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar. Qatar called the decision \\"unjustified\\" and with \\"no basis in fact\\". The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran. The Saudi statement accused Qatar of collaborating with \\"Iranian-backed terrorist groups\\" in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain. The diplomatic withdrawal was first put into motion by Bahrain, then Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives all followed suit. SPA cited officials as saying the decision was taken to \\"protect its national security from the dangers of terrorism and extremism\\". Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. However, Saudi Arabia says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. So far, there has been no sign of reciprocal moves by Qatar. In the latest developments: Why this row has erupted Food, flights and football at risk While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a \\"shameful cybercrime\\". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. 'A Qatarstrophe' - social media reacts All you need to know about Qatar The story behind Qatar 'hack' More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it \\"promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly\\". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hardline jihadist groups, in Syria. Where key countries stand on IS Where does IS get its support? 2.7m population 2m of whom are men 11,437 sq km in size (4,416 sq miles) 77 years life expectancy (men) 80 years for women While on a visit to Riyadh two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, and blamed Iran for instability in the Middle East. \\"It seems that the Saudis and Emiratis feel emboldened by the alignment of their regional interests - toward Iran and Islamism - with the Trump administration,\\" Gulf analyst Kristian Ulrichsen told Reuters news agency. \\"[They] have decided to deal with Qatar's alternative approach on the assumption that they will have the [Trump] administration's backing.\\" Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies. In recent days, British Prime Minister Theresa May has also come under pressure from election rivals to publish a report thought to focus on the funding of UK extremist groups by Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would \\"not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents\\". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking in Sydney, urged the countries to resolve their differences through dialogue. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said there was a need for \\"transparent dialogue and diplomacy\\", adding: \\"No country in the region will benefit from the heightened tension.\\" Qatar's stock market closed down 7.27%. One of the likely knock-on effects is on food stability: about 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come  by lorry from Saudi Arabia. The Doha News newspaper reported that people had rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food and water. Nearly 90% of Qatar's population are migrant workers, many of whom are working on the construction boom fuelled by the successful World Cup bid. There have long been tensions not far beneath the surface. Qatar has often seemed out of step with its neighbours. It has tended, for example, to side with Islamist forces in the Middle East - like the Muslim Brotherhood, which is reviled by the Saudis and the current Egyptian leadership. Past efforts by the neighbours to pull the Qataris into line have had limited impact. But now Doha has suddenly come under much greater and more co-ordinated pressure. Emboldened by President Trump's trip two weeks ago, the Saudis and the Emiratis believe that this is the moment to make clear to Qatar that its divergent views will no longer be tolerated. And right now this small country's rulers will probably be feeling very lonely indeed.

Panetta: Muslim protests leveling off, but will go on ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT (AP) -- Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the turmoil raging across the Muslim world is likely to continue into the days ahead, but he says the violence expected by the U.S. appears to be leveling off. He said the Pentagon has \\"deployed our forces to a number of areas in the region to be prepared to respond to any requests that we receive to be able to protect our personnel and our American property.\\" He declined to provide more details on reports that the military may be moving additional military forces so they can respond to unrest in any of a number of regions of concern. \\"I think our approach right now is to not do anything until we've been requested to do it by the State Department,\\" Panetta told reporters traveling with him to Asia. But he noted that, \\"I think that we have to continue to be very vigilant because I suspect that ... these demonstrations are likely to continue over the next few days, if not longer.\\" Meanwhile, the leader of Hezbollah has called for protests against an anti-Islam video starting on Monday but says Muslims must not attack embassies. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said Sunday that the Shiite militant group will organize demonstrations against the film in different parts of Lebanon. Protests by furious Muslims erupted in countries around the world in recent days, with some spawning violence and even deaths over an anti-Islam video shot in California that denigrates the prophet Mohammed. In places like Libya, Sudan and Tunisia, protesters stormed U.S. embassies, and an American fast food restaurant was burned in Lebanon. In response, the Pentagon dispatched elite Marine rapid response teams to Libya and Yemen, but a team deployed to Khartoum on Friday was turned back when the Sudanese government objected. Asked about Sudan's decision, Panetta said host countries have the right to reject such military deployments. \\"My understanding is that they felt that they could provide sufficient security to be able to protect our embassy and our personnel there,\\" said Panetta. \\"And you know, in many ways, as all of you know the primary responsibility for protecting embassies rests with the host country.\\" Known as a fleet antiterrorism security teams, the units were sent in response to violent protests in Khartoum where protesters tried to climb the walls of the U.S. Embassy, setting off a battle with police. The Navy also moved two warships to positions off the coast of Libya. The two destroyers are largely meant as a show of force, but they carry Tomahawk missiles and can also be available for evacuations or other missions as needed. The intensity of the anti-American fervor initially caught U.S. leaders by surprise, but in the last several days the Obama administration has deployed military units to shore up security in hotspots, and used diplomacy to call for calm and urge foreign governments to protect American interests in their countries. It also has been unclear how much of the violence was spontaneously triggered by the film and how much of it was spurred on by anti-American militants using it as a tool to grow and enrage the crowds. The al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen praised the killing of the U.S. ambassador in Libya in an online statement Saturday and called for more attacks to expel American embassies from Muslim nations. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed Tuesday along with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi. President Obama has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice, but has also stressed that the U.S. respects religious freedom. The protests were set off by a low-budget, crudely produced film called \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" which portrays Mohammed as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester. A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site. Panetta was traveling to Asia, where he will visit Japan, China and New Zealand. His visit comes amid escalating tensions in the region including tussles over several disputed islands in the East China Sea. It is Panetta's third trip to the region in the last 11 months, reflecting the Pentagon's ongoing effort to put a greater military focus on the Pacific region.

Turn the heat to medium and cook the bacon for a few minutes.","output":"As the bacon begins to release its fat and turn slightly crisp, add 1 cup (150 g) of finely chopped shallots and 3 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet. Stir the ingredients together and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes until the shallots become translucent and the garlic is fragrant, being careful not to let the garlic burn. In the meantime, wash and trim 1 pound (453 g) of fresh green beans, removing any tough ends. Set the beans aside while the bacon, shallots, and garlic are sautéing, allowing them to drain if necessary. Once the bacon, shallot, and garlic mixture is cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the ingredients from the skillet, leaving the rendered bacon fat behind. Set the cooked bacon mixture aside on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess grease. Now, add the green beans to the skillet with the remaining bacon fat, turning the heat up slightly to medium-high. Stir fry the green beans for approximately 5-7 minutes, or until they are slightly tender but still a bit crisp. If needed, you can add some additional oil, such as vegetable or peanut oil, to ensure that the green beans cook evenly and don't stick to the skillet. While the green beans are stir-frying, mix up the sauce in a small bowl. Combine 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Whisk the ingredients together until the cornstarch has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Once the green beans have reached the desired tenderness, add the cooked bacon, shallots, and garlic back into the skillet. Pour the sauce over the green beans and the bacon mixture, and stir to coat everything evenly. Allow the sauce to bubble and thicken for about 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep the ingredients from sticking to the skillet. The sauce should begin to coat the green beans and bacon mixture, forming a rich, glossy glaze. Once the sauce has thickened and the green beans, bacon, and shallots are heated through, remove the skillet from the heat. Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary. To give the dish extra flavor and color, sprinkle it with 1/4 cup (30 g) of chopped, toasted almonds for added crunch and nuttiness, and top it off with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for an optional touch of heat. Serve the stir-fried green beans immediately, as a side dish or over steamed rice for a complete meal.

They awaken a neighbor, who has a helicopter, and all three fly to the crash site. Putnam climbs down into the crater and notices a partially buried round object in the crater's pit. He comes to the realization, after he sees a six-sided hatchway close, that this isn't a meteorite but a large alien spaceship. The hatchway's noise starts a landslide that completely buries the craft. Putnam's story is later scoffed at by Sand Rock's sheriff (Charles Drake) and the local news media. Even Ellen Fields is unsure about what to believe but still agrees to assist Putnam in his investigation. Over the next several days, local people disappear; a few return, but they act distant or appear somewhat dazed. Convinced by these and other odd events, Sheriff Warren comes to believe Putnam's story that the meteorite is actually a crashed spaceship with alien inhabitants; he then organizes a posse to hunt down the invaders at their crash site. Putnam, however, hopes to reach a peaceful solution to the looming crisis. Alone, he enters a nearby abandoned mine, which he hopes will eventually connect to the now buried spaceship and its alien occupants. Putnam finally discovers the spaceship and learns from its crew that they crashed on Earth by accident; the aliens appear benign and only plan to stay on Earth just long enough to repair their damaged craft and then continue on their voyage.

Instead, the situation described in the premise presents a scenario that contradicts the hypothesis. The premise paints a picture of a chaotic situation in which people are panicking, dropping their ropes, running, and trampling over each other in an attempt to flee. There are several reasons why the hypothesis does not hold up in light of this premise: 1. The emotional state of the individuals in the premise is described as being in \\"blind panic.\\" This conflicts directly with the hypothesis that they were calmed. Panic implies intense fear, anxiety, and chaos, while to be calmed suggests a state of peace, relaxation, and composure. 2. In the premise, it is stated that most of the individuals dropped their ropes, which again contradicts the hypothesis. The hypothesis asserts that people kept holding their ropes, while the premise tells us that they abandoned the ropes as a result of their panic. 3. The behavior of trampling over each other further illustrates the chaotic nature of the situation depicted in the premise, indicating that the individuals are far from being calm and composed. The frantic need to escape danger took precedence over any concern for the well-being of others in the vicinity. 4. The description of their flight for safety as \\"random\\" implies a lack of order or organization, which is another characteristic that is at odds with the idea of being calmed and maintaining control of their ropes. In conclusion, based on the premise provided, we cannot assert that the hypothesis \\"They were calmed and kept holding their ropes\\" is true.

With it partially opened it doesn't lie flat. Why they make it this way is beyond me. The answer is:","output":"Dissatisfied. The customer who left this review appears to be dissatisfied with the product they purchased. There are several reasons as to why this conclusion can be drawn from the review provided: 1. Negative tone: The customer's language and tone throughout the review indicate their frustration and disappointment with the product. The use of phrases such as \\"Why they make it this way is beyond me\\" and \\"you can't use this rule to measure anything\\" clearly express their dissatisfaction. 2. Inconvenience: The main issue the customer has with the product is that the measurements are printed on the wrong side of the rule, making it impossible to use unless it is fully opened. This renders the product inefficient for its intended purpose, which is likely to contribute to the customer's overall dissatisfaction. 3. Quality concerns: The customer's comment that \\"with it partially opened it doesn't lie flat\\" indicates that they perceive the quality of the product to be lacking. This can be inferred due to their expectation that the rule should be able to lie flat even when partially opened, but it fails to do so, adding to their dissatisfaction with the product. 4. Confusion over manufacturing: The customer questions the rationale behind the design and manufacturing choices, specifically the placement of the measurements. This demonstrates their lack of understanding as to why the product was made this way, likely leading them to be even more dissatisfied. Taking these factors into consideration, it is evident that the customer who left the review was dissatisfied with their purchase. The negative tone, inconvenience caused by the design, perceived low quality, and confusion over manufacturing all contribute to their dissatisfaction with the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: From the time each of my children started school, I packed their lunches. And in each lunch I packed, I left a note. The note might be a thank-you for a special moment, or a few words of encouragement for the coming test or sporting event. When they were little, they loved their notes. And when I went back to teaching, they even put notes in my lunches. As they grew older, my elder son, Marc, told me that he no longer needed my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to read them but I still needed to write them, I continued the tradition until the day he graduated. Six years after high school graduation, Marc called and asked if he could stay at home for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, and he was very successful. He lived far away from home. With his younger sister leaving for college, I was especially looking forward to seeing Marc at home. Since I was still making lunch every day for his younger brother, I packed one for Marc, too. Imagine my surprise when I got a call from my 24-year-old son, complaining   about his lunch. \\"Did I do something wrong? Aren't I still your kid? Don't you love me any more, Mom?\\" he asked. I laughingly asked him what was wrong. \\"My note, Mom,\\" he answered. \\"Where's my note?\\" This year my younger son will be in high school. He, too, has said that he is too old for notes. But like his elder brother and sister, he will receive those notes till the day he graduates. Question: Every time the writer packed lunches for her children,  _  .

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who played drums for the Smashing Pumpkins?  The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released... A:","output":"The last name of the person who played drums for the Smashing Pumpkins is Chamberlin.

The following year, Libyan fighters began intercepting U.S. fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the two countries. Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi'ite communities across the world also deteriorated due to the August 1978 disappearance of imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt's Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into Uganda to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to retreat. Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising him.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Muammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya, sent soldiers into Uganda in 1979 to defend the regime of President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The Federal Resister published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" is true, then it supports the hypothesis \\"The Federal Register published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\" The premise provides specific information about a rulemaking that took place in the given year, 1996, which confirms the idea presented in the hypothesis. To further understand the connection between the premise and the hypothesis, let's break down the information in the premise. 1. The rulemaking mentioned is a \\"proposed\\" rulemaking, which indicates that it is a suggested regulation or amendment to an existing rule that was open for discussion, debate, and consideration. This proposed rulemaking could have been in its initial stage or could have been revised after taking feedback from the stakeholders or public. 2. The premise indicates that the proposed rulemaking was \\"published\\" in the Federal Register. The Federal Register is the official daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices from federal agencies and organizations, executive orders, and other presidential documents. As a result, the published rulemaking would have been accessible to the public, stakeholders, and other interested parties. 3. The publication date for the proposed rulemaking is mentioned as \\"September 6, 1996,\\" which falls within the given year. This point is critical in supporting the hypothesis, as it confirms that the publication of the proposed rulemaking occurred in 1996. 4. Lastly, the \\"61 Fed.\\" notation refers to the volume number of the Federal Register (Vol. 61) in which the proposed rulemaking was published. This information is significant, as it helps locate the exact document within the daily editions of the Federal Register for archival and referencing purposes. In summary, the premise \\"The proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on September 6, 1996, 61 Fed.\\" provides enough information to support the hypothesis \\"The Federal Register published a proposed rulemaking in 1996.\\" By presenting the nature of the rulemaking, its publication in the Federal Register, a specific date within 1996, and the volume number in which it appeared, the premise strengthens and corroborates the hypothesis's claim."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Final Cut Context: The serial opens with Prime Minister Francis Urquhart shooting his gun dog, now too old to perform its duties â a scene which establishes the theme of the ending of a career. Shortly afterwards, Urquhart attends the fictional state funeral of Margaret Thatcher. He publicly praises Thatcher as his mentor, but privately begrudges her record as the longest-serving prime minister in recent history,[note 1] a record that Urquhart himself is soon to surpass. To \\"leave my mark on the world,\\" Urquhart champions a treaty resolving the Cyprus dispute while secretly working to bring offshore oil deposits under the control of the Turkish authorities on the island so that a Turkish-British consortium will have the drilling rights; an executive of the consortium has promised to provide for Urquhart's retirement fund in return. Urquhart also has a personal connection to Cyprus: as a nineteen-year-old British Army lieutenant serving there in 1956, he killed two young EOKA guerrillas while trying to get information from them. Urquhart has frequent nightmares and flashbacks of this event, and also of the murders of Mattie Storin and others, shown in the previous series. On a motorway near London, Urquhart's car is rammed by another car containing three drunken louts. The attackers are quickly killed by his security staff. Urquhart sustains minor head injuries in the collision, but his life is not endangered. When Elizabeth arrives at hospital, he is delirious and confuses the incident on the motorway with the incident in Cyprus. Tom Makepeace, Urquhart's Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, chairs a cabinet meeting while Urquhart is in hospital; Urquhart considers Makepeace â the actual negotiator of the Cyprus treaty â as a potential challenger, although he doesn't take the threat very seriously, considering him \\"not a fighter\\" but \\"a sentimental dreamer\\". The brother of the murdered Greek Cypriot guerrillas, who witnessed their deaths, lives in London and recognises Urquhart as the soldier who killed them. He...

The Kings, led by coach Rick Adelman, finished the regular season with a record of 44-38, securing the 8th seed in the Western Conference. The Kings' roster during that season featured notable players like Metta World Peace, Mike Bibby, Brad Miller, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, and Bonzi Wells.

The first-round playoff series was a hard-fought battle during which the Kings managed to push the Spurs to six games. However, the Spurs ultimately prevailed, winning the series 4-2 and ending the Kings' playoff run. Since the 2005-2006 season, the Kings have not made it back to the NBA playoffs, marking a 15-year drought, one of the longest active streaks in the league.

Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV) - Located in the city of Lod, near Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport is the largest and the busiest airport in Israel. It handles both passenger flights and cargo services and serves as the main gateway for domestic and international flights. 2. Ramon International Airport (ETM) - Situated 18 kilometers north of Eilat, Ramon International Airport is a new airport that started operations in 2019. It mainly serves the southern region of Israel and functions as the main international gateway to the Red Sea resort area. In addition to these international airports, Israel operates several smaller airports for domestic flights and general aviation purposes: 1. Sde Dov Airport (SDV) - Located in Tel Aviv, Sde Dov Airport handled mostly domestic flights before ceasing its operations in 2019. Its operations were transferred to Ben Gurion International Airport.    2. Eilat Airport (ETH) - Eilat Airport formerly served the city of Eilat. It ceased operations in 2019 when the Ramon International Airport opened. 3. Herzliya Airport (HRZ) - As a small regional airport, Herzliya is primarily used for general aviation, flight training, and private flights within the country. 4. Rosh Pina Airport (RPN) - Also known as Ben Yaakov Airport, Rosh Pina Airport offers domestic flights and serves the northern region of Israel. 5. Haifa Airport (HFA) - Also known as U Michaeli Airport, this airport provides regional services, connecting Haifa to other major cities within Israel. Israel also has several smaller airstrips and military airbases, such as: 1. Palmachim Airbase 2. Nevatim Airbase 3. Ramat David Airbase 4. Hatzor Airbase 5. Ovda Airbase Please note that this list is not exhaustive and the number of airports or airbases can change over time. However, taking into account the main international and domestic airports, along with the airstrips and military airbases, there are over ten airports in Israel. This number can serve as a more appropriate answer to the original question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Here's a question: Where are you if you've received bbq after paying?  Here are possible answers to this question: - ribs - backyard - texas - restaurant - louisiana  I believe the correct choice is \\"restaurant\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"\\"restaurant\\" Step 1: Analyze the given options In this step, I'll look at each possible answer and evaluate whether it could be a suitable response to the question. Option 1: ribs Ribs are a type of food, specifically a cut of meat that is often barbecued, but the location in question is not the food itself, so this answer is eliminated. Option 2: backyard A backyard may be a location where one could have a barbecue, but typically, the act of paying for the food would not take place in this setting, since backyard barbecues tend to be more casual, so this answer is eliminated. Option 3: texas Texas is a region known for its barbecue offerings, but since it is an entire state, it does not provide a specific enough answer to where someone would receive a barbecue after paying, so this answer is eliminated. Option 4: restaurant A restaurant is a place where one can go to order food, like barbecue, and would typically pay for the meal after it is served. This option is most fitting for the situation mentioned in the question. Option 5: louisiana Louisiana is another region known for its food culture, but like Texas, it is too broad to specify a particular location where someone would receive barbecue after paying. So, this answer is eliminated. Step 2: Select the best option Based on the analysis of each possible answer, the most appropriate response to the question is \\"restaurant\\" because it is the only location that directly satisfies both conditions of receiving barbecue and paying for it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The moon rover, known as Yutu in Mandarin Chinese, and the Chang'e-3 lander were restarted by the Beijing Aerospace Control Center (BACC), China's Xinhua news agency said. It had been set to sleep for two weeks to ride out extreme climatic conditions and will finally undertake its scientific mission. The Jade Rabbit was \\" put to sleep\\" on 26 December at the onset of the first lunar night of the mission. One night on the moon lasts for around two weeks on Earth and during this time, temperatures fall to -180degC ---conditions too cold for the equipment to function in. There is also no sunlight to power the Jade Rabbit's solar panels. Zhou Jianliang, chief engineer with the BACC, explained: \\" During the lunar night, the lander and the rover were in a power-off condition and the communication with Earth was cut off. \\" When the night ends, they will be started up with the power provided by sunlight and resume operation and communication according to preset programmes. He added that the Jade Rabbit surviving the lunar night showed Chinese technology had proved successful. The Jade Rabbit and the lander compose Chang'e-3 landed on the moon on 14 December. With the landing, China became one of only three nations to soft-land on the moon, and the first to do so in more than three decades. Scientists said the mission was designed to test new technologies and build the country's expertise of space exploration. The Jade Rabbit will gather scientific data and capture images from the Moon. China was planning further missions planned to collect lunar soil samples and it is thought officials are looking to conduct manned lunar landings if they prove successful. According to Zhou Jianliang we can know that   _  .

The short, definite, confident strokes of a barbers straight blade moving across my face is great. I find it all very relaxing.   But, I found nothing relaxing about this barber shop. When I walked in, the music was very loud latin music. It reminded me of music you hear at a night club.   The towels felt more warm than hot. When I mentioned the towels weren't hot, she argued they were hot!! I'm not sure, but I think the towel might have been hot. I think she pulled it out of the hot box and ran it under hot water. The hot water isn't nearly as hot as the towel when it comes out of the hot box, so it actually would cool the towel. Not positive if that is what happened, but the towel should have been much hotter and the barber should not have argued with me.    The barber was a very young woman. She took no care in applying the pre-shave oil. She did not slap it on, but I doubt I would have noticed too much of a difference if she had slapped it on. There was a quickness that felt rushed.   Now the worst part....the blade across my face HURT!!!!! It hurt a LOT!!!! I made her stop. I just couldn't take it. I left with only a 1/4 of my face shaved.

The 5.2cm (two inch) coin was taken to the auction house in Dorchester, Dorset, by its owner who was unaware of its significance. The Declaration Pound, which dates from 1643, was described by auctioneers as \\"extremely rare\\". It was struck in Oxford, a year after the English Civil War broke out, at a new mint created to launch an official currency under Royalist control. Duke's Auctioneers had expected the coin to fetch £50,000. It had been handed down through several generations to the current owner, who said she did not know where it had originally come from. The coin marks Charles I's attempts to regain his failing power from the Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. A legend inscribed on the back of the coin in Latin reads: \\"Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered\\". It is seen as a declaration of the king's power and his belief in absolute monarchy. According to the National Archives, £1 in 1640 would have been worth £85.80 in 2005.

If you're in a relationship with a player, you're probably not the only woman he's seeing. Making your relationship public will make it easier for his lies to be exposed to both you and the other women, and for that reason, he'll usually reject the idea of being public about it.  The way he treats you in public will be one good indication. If he refuses to treat you with any special affection or treats you just as affectionately as other women, it might be his way of keeping your relationship a secret. To that end, he might also avoid spending time with you in certain places if he thinks there's a better chance of being caught there. Check social media accounts, too. If he refuses to be “friends” or “followers” with you, or if he never responds to any public comments you make toward him, it could be a sign that he's trying to hide your relationship. Refusing to update his “relationship status” might be another social media clue. Try to spend time with his friends. Most players won't want you anywhere near their friends, and it won't be because they're afraid of another man stealing you away.  If he lets you meet his friends, he takes the risk that someone within the group will slip and reveal information about his true self. If you do meet his friends, watch his behavior around them. Some players will drop their guard and show their true colors when they're hanging around their buddies. Invite him to meet your friends and family. Since a player isn't serious about you, he will usually refuse such offers or make excuses to get out of them at the last minute. Moreover, friends and relatives with a keen eye might be able to spot a player when they see one. A player who agrees to meet your loved ones would have to take the risk of being discovered by someone like that. Ask around about the guy and find out if there are any rumors about him. People in his own social circle might cover for him, but anyone who isn't attached to him won't have a need to do so.  Ask your close friends to do their own investigating on your behalf, as well. They probably have a few connections you don't have, and one of those connections might have helpful information. You could even consider talking with the guy's ex-girlfriends, but do so with caution. Some exes will intentionally paint a bad picture as an act of revenge. Additionally, an ex-girlfriend who believes that you “stole” the guy away from her may take out her negative feelings on you. Players lack respect for you, but that's because they lack respect for everyone. It can be difficult to tell when a guy is disrespecting you, but it'll probably be easier to detect disrespect he shows toward others.  Pay particular attention to the way he treats and talks about other women. Even disrespect he shows toward female relatives can indicate an overall sense of disrespect toward women in general. Watch how he treats workers at the places you visit, too. Players may relish in the authority they have over these staff members.","output":"The article discusses how to identify if one is in a relationship with a \\"player,\\" highlighting signs such as the individual's reluctance to make the relationship public, noncommittal social media interactions, hesitation to introduce you to their friends due to the risk of their true character being exposed, unwillingness to meet your loved ones, and general lack of respect towards you and others; it also suggests seeking information about the person through your social network and observing their behavior towards other women and service industry workers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.  - An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books.  - Charles Copeland ( 1858 -- 1945 ) was an American book illustrator active from about 1887 until about 1940 . He was a member of the Boston Watercolor Society and the Boston Art Club . His illustrations were used in a variety of books .  - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.

Article:Kevin Whyman, 39, was flying a Folland Gnat aircraft that came down near the event at Oulton Park at about 14:00 BST. BBC presenter Chris Evans, CarFest's founder, confirmed his death and said the pilot's family had been informed. A visibly upset Mr Evans delivered a statement saying the display pilot had been killed in a \\"tragic accident\\". The Heritage Aircraft Trust, operator of the Gnat Display Team, said in a statement: \\"Kevin was a Royal Air Force-trained fast jet pilot whose enthusiasm for flying the Folland Gnat was infectious. \\"He will be greatly missed by his family, the team and many friends. \\"Kevin leaves a wife and young daughter.\\" Mr Whyman, who was born in Chester, is a Cambridge University economics graduate. He trained with the university's boat club and coxed Cambridge to victory in the 1996 and 1997 boat races against Oxford. He had a career with the RAF from 1998 to 2001, when he left for a trading job with a US investment bank in the City of London. He completed his civilian flying licences so that he could continue with his passion for flying. BBC producer Justin Bones, on the scene at Oulton Park, said two planes performed a low-level, close-proximity pass just before the crash. One of the aircraft failed to pull up and crashed north of the circuit, he said. Mr Evans said: \\"The event will continue on the advice of the three aviation authorities we are currently involved with, as part of the ongoing investigation to what happened. \\"And the police have also advised us that the best thing, and the safest thing to do, is to carry on with the event, bearing in mind there are 10,000 children here, and that's what we are going to do.\\" Cheshire Police say they are working to establish how the accident happened. Eyewitnesses described horrified spectators screaming as the plane nosedived suddenly. Witness Steve Gluning, who works with aircraft, said: \\"It's an airshow and it's dangerous. You know these things can happen but when they happen in front of you it's shocking. \\"We were at the CarFest, my partner and I. Two Gnats came in. Five or six minutes doing individual and pair displays. They did a crossover. One went north and the other, I saw it jink. It went past the trees. Two or three seconds later there was a fireball. \\"Instantly, you know that could be fatal.\\" Tessa Angel was watching the display with her husband. \\"We saw two planes flying, weaving side by side. One was at a strange angle. My husband said: 'That's low. I hope he comes back up.' Then it went down,\\" she said. \\"People were staring, asking what happened. I didn't see any parachute. There were sirens within seconds, then a helicopter hovering.\\" Aviation expert Julian Bray said the type of Gnat plane involved in the crash had been around since 1955. Peter Collins, a test pilot and former RAF pilot based in Cheshire, is familiar with the aircraft. He told the BBC: \\"I flew it during training. I rate it as one of the best aeroplanes I've ever flown. \\"It was designed as a fighter that was later turned into a trainer.\\" CarFest's organisers said in a statement: \\"Our thoughts are with the family of the pilot and all those affected at this time. \\"We have helpfully received images and footage captured by those close to the site, which will aid with the police investigation. \\"Should anyone else have similar photo or video footage, they are asked to keep hold of it in case the authorities request further information.\\" An Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said: \\"AAIB will be investigating and is sending a team to the site.\\" Mr Evans, a car enthusiast who has just become the new presenter of BBC Top Gear, created the motoring and music festival, which raises money for BBC Children in Need.

The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 103.50 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.80 males. Question: How many percent were not 65 years of age or older? Answer:","output":"In the given population statistics, 25.60% of the population were under the age of 18, 9.20% were between 18 to 24 years old, 32.20% were between 25 to 44 years old, and 22.30% were between 45 to 64 years old. The remaining percentage, 10.70%, were 65 years of age or older. To find the percentage of the population not belonging to the 65 years or older age group, we simply subtract the percentage of people who are 65 years or older from the total population percentage, which is 100%. So, we have 100% (total population percentage) - 10.70% (percentage of people 65 years old or older) = 89.30% Therefore, 89.30% of the population were not 65 years of age or older."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information:  - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\".  - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct).  - The bamboos are evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement. The dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.  - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping.  - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Michelia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Magnolia family ( Magnoliaceae ) . The genus includes about 50 species of evergreen trees and shrubs , native to tropical and subtropical south and southeast Asia ( Indomalaya ) , including southern China .  - In biological classification, rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc.  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - Beijing (formerly romanised as Peking) is the capital of the People's Republic of China and the world's third most populous city proper. It is also one of the world's most populous capital cities. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighbouring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.  - Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol.  - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants.  - Liriodendron is a genus of two species of characteristically large deciduous trees in the magnolia family (Magnoliaceae).  - The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants. Classification. The Magnoliales include six families:  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - The Magnoliaceae are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which \\"Magnolia\\" is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which \\"Liriodendron\\" (tulip trees) is the only genus.  - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year, always green. This contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season. There are many different kinds of evergreen plants, both trees and shrubs. Evergreens include:  - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.  - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use.  - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).    What entity does 'michelia' has the relation 'taxon rank' with? The answer is:","output":"The entity that 'Michelia' has the relation 'taxon rank' with is the genus level in the biological classification system. Michelia is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Magnolia family (Magnoliaceae). The genus includes about 50 species of evergreen trees and shrubs, native to tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia, including Southern China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so.

Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \\"The Four Cohans.\\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \\"Over There\\", \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\", \\"The Yankee Doodle Boy\\" and \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\". Context: From 1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881-1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900-1988). Levey joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of adultery.  In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883-1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father's play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical George M!. Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931. Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914-2000), who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father's songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.'s only child, Michaela Marie Cohan (1943-1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather's induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University.  Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants.  He died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942, at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. He received his last rites from Mgr. John J. Casey, representing Archbishop Francis Spellman, and Rev. Francis X. Shea, vicar of the Archdiocese of New York. His funeral was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York and was attended by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, George Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, Eugene O'Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring. Cohan was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, in a private family mausoleum he had erected a quarter century earlier for his sister and parents. Question: What happened with this marriage?. Whats the answer?","output":"George M. Cohan was married two times in his life. His first marriage was with Ethel Levey, who was an actress and dancer. They had a daughter named Georgette. But in 1907, Ethel divorced George because of his cheating. Then, in 1908, George got married again to Agnes Mary Nolan. They stayed married until George passed away and had three children together: Mary, Helen, and George Jr."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Therefore, \\" a report on the country's co-operation with the ICTY\\" becomes \\"ülkenin ICTY ile işbirliği üzerine bir raporu.\\"  In the end, I considered the differences in syntax and grammar between English and Turkish, restructured the sentences accordingly, and translated all of the words and phrases accurately."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In this sentence, the person in question is elected to the position of Chairman of Zilla Parishad, which is a Panchayat District, for Kolhapur. The person was running for this position as a representative of the Indian National Congress party. 2. In 2012, he was elected Chairman of the Indian National Congress (Panchayat District) of Kolhapur as a candidate of Zilla Parishad. In this sentence, the person was elected to the position of Chairman of the Indian National Congress for the Panchayat District level in Kolhapur. However, this statement is somewhat confusing because it suggests the person was a candidate of Zilla Parishad. Zilla Parishad is a local governing body, not a political party, so it's unclear what it means for someone to be a candidate of Zilla Parishad in this context.

Angelina appeared in two seasons of the Jersey Shore (out of a total of six seasons) with an intermittent presence. In Season 1, she left halfway through the season. After being evicted from the house by her roommates, Angelina exited the show during the third episode due to her reluctance to work her mandatory shift at the T-shirt store, which was a rule for all house residents.  Subsequently, Angelina made a surprising comeback for Season 2, which was filmed in Miami Beach, Florida. However, her return was short-lived as well, as she encountered several conflicts among her fellow cast members, leading to her departure from the show in the tenth episode.

I had high hopes for this book but was completely let down and actually returned it. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light for several reasons. Firstly, it is specifically mentioned that this book is only suitable for absolute beginners and holds little value for anyone with existing knowledge of proper eating habits. This statement narrows down the book's target audience, limiting its potential appeal. Secondly, the reviewer implies that the author might have been influenced by corporate interests. This raises doubts about the objectivity and credibility of the content, which can negatively impact the readers' trust in the given advice and recommendations. Additionally, the lack of alternative options or flexibility in food choices may cause accessibility issues for potential readers who do not have access to specific food types or brands. This constraint can discourage people from attempting to follow the suggestions given, hindering their ability to benefit from the book's content. Furthermore, the reviewer describes the workout regimen in the book as \\"completely basic and rudimentary,\\" which implies a lack of innovation or depth in the exercise program. The mention that it may only be suitable for those who have never worked out before or the elderly suggests that the book might be too simplistic for anyone looking for a more challenging or sophisticated workout routine. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer ultimately decided to return the book highlights their dissatisfaction with the product, therefore reinforcing the unflattering depiction of the product. In conclusion, this review presents the product in an unflattering light, painting a picture of a book with limited appeal, lack of flexibility, and questionable credibility, offering little value to its readers, except for those who are entirely new to proper eating and working out."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They expect me to be the same person I was before I went abroad, but I'm not! Why can't they let me be myself? Jimmy Hi, Jimmy, As far as I know, people who have lived abroad often find that the adjustment   to returning home is more difficult than their adjustment to living in a foreign culture. Why? We expect to have some problems when we go to a new place, speak a different language and learn the rules of a different culture ... But home? ... we know that place! Your parents expect that the same person who boarded the airplane one year ago will be returning. Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained   an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return. Remember you have been living a different lifestyle in your host country, and you have probably become very independent while staying there alone. Now that you're home, you will be expected to conform   again to the lifestyle of your family. As a result, you may be upset about your parents' involvement in your life. Communication is the key to overcoming this problem. Tell your parents how you are feeling. Share with them information about cultural re-entry , and ask them to be patient.

Write a summary based on this article: Nobody told Moody’s it was a holiday-shortened week.      After cutting Greece’s credit rating and warning that it was putting Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo under review, the ratings agency took aim at Uncle Sam Thursday afternoon.      Moody’s said that if U.S. lawmakers do not make progress on raising the debt ceiling, it “expects to place the US government’s rating under review for possible downgrade, due to the very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.”      Raising the ceiling would preserve the Aaa rating, but the outlook could be altered due to longer-term debt concerns, Moody’s said, noting that without a fiscal consolidation plan over the coming weeks the likelihood of progress before the 2012 election is slim.      According to Moody’s the implications of the jawboning in Washington are:      1) The likelihood that Moody’s will place the US government’s rating on review for downgrade due to the risk of a short-lived default has increased. Since the risk of continuing stalemate has grown, if progress in negotiations is not evident by the middle of July, such a rating action is likely. The Secretary of the Treasury has indicated that the government will have to drastically reduce expenditure sometime around August 2 if the debt limit is not raised; the initiation of a rating review would precede this date. 2) If a debt-ceiling-related default were to occur, Moody’s would likely downgrade the rating shortly thereafter. The extent of and length of time before a downgrade would depend on how factors surrounding the default affect the government’s fundamental creditworthiness, including (a) the speed at which the default were cured, (b) an assessment of the effect of the default on long-term Treasury borrowing costs, and (c) measures put in place to prevent a recurrence. However, a rating in the Aa range would be the most likely outcome. Any loss to bondholders would likely be minimal or non-existent, as Moody’s anticipates that a default would be cured quickly. 3) If default is avoided, the Aaa rating would likely be affirmed after any review. Whether the outlook on the rating would be stable or negative would depend upon whether the outcome of the negotiations included meaningful progress toward substantial and credible long-term deficit reduction. Such reduction would imply stabilization within a few years and ultimately a decline in the government’s debt ratios, including the ratio of debt to GDP. Moody’s Updates on Rating Implications of US Debt Limit, Long-Term Budget Negotiations.      Thursday’s move by Moody’s comes after rival Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on America’s ability to repay its debts in April. (See “Little Surprise In S&P’s Negative Outlook On U.S. Debt Rating.”) Those concerns are not being born out in the market to date. The 10-year Treasury yield is just a shade over 3% Thursday.      Anyone that was waiting on a ratings agency action to realize that the U.S. is in troubling fiscal shape, or who thinks that such action will suddenly strike up a desire for compromise on Capitol Hill, probably has bigger troubles. ||||| “We didn’t create this mess,” one Republican told Mr. Geithner, according to a person in the room.      Independent analyses have shown that more than half of the 14.3 trillion debt is from policies enacted during the past decade when Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress, and much of the rest from lost revenues and stimulus spending and tax cuts since Mr. Obama took office at the height of the financial crisis and recession .      Mr. Geithner, as he left the Capitol, told reporters: “I’m confident two things are going to happen this summer. One is we are going to avoid a default crisis. And we are going to reach agreement on a long-term fiscal plan.”      Representative Austin Scott, the Georgia Republican who is the leader of the freshman class, said after the meeting that House Republicans had a “fundamental” difference with Democrats on taxes: instead of new tax revenues, the Republicans want additional tax cuts to increase economic growth. Still, he said, “I think we are all hopeful we will get to a resolution.”      Earlier, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner met privately with House Democrats at the White House about debt-reduction matters, following a similar session on Wednesday with House Republicans.      “Just as he discussed with the Republican caucus, the president highlighted the need for both parties to work together to take a balanced approach to deficit reduction, one that allows us to live within our means without hurting our ability to invest in the future or burdening our middle class or seniors,” an administration official said.      House Democrats said they would support Mr. Obama if he reached a compromise with Republicans that included long-term spending cuts, but not to Medicare benefits, as well as higher tax revenues, according to those briefed on the meeting.

Boehner , said in a statement, “The White House needs to get serious right now about dealing with our deficit and debt.” He interpreted the Moody’s report as bolstering his contention that “a credible agreement means the spending cuts must exceed the debt-limit increase.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Moody’s, however, made no mention of how a deficit-reduction deal should be structured.      The Moody’s report was unexpected. In April, Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook for the AAA rating on United States debt — but not the rating itself — to negative from stable. Moody’s cautionary note was more pointed in that it was pegged to the current political maneuvering over the debt limit and it urged a resolution weeks sooner than the White House and Congressional leaders were aiming for.      Its warning was two-pronged. First, Moody’s said, if Congress does not increase the Treasury ’s borrowing authority in coming weeks, the nation’s credit rating may be lowered “due to the very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.” That is likely to translate into higher interest rates at a time when the recovery shows signs of slowing again.      And second, Moody’s said, with an implicit slap at both parties, that whether the United States keeps its triple-A rating “will depend on the outcome of negotiations on deficit reduction.”      “Although Moody’s fully expected political wrangling prior to an increase in the statutory debt limit, the degree of entrenchment into conflicting positions has exceeded expectations,” the company’s statement said. “The heightened polarization over the debt limit has increased the odds of a short-lived default.”      The goal of the bipartisan budget talks that Mr. Obama initiated in April, led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , has been to reach agreement on deep long-term spending cuts by Aug. 2. That is when the Treasury Department has said it will run out of accounting maneuvers to meet the nation’s financial obligations without breaching the 14.3 trillion debt limit, which would provoke a crisis, even default.      House Republicans have said they will not agree to an increase without parallel action on spending cuts of an even greater amount. The debt limit would have to be raised 2.4 trillion to carry the government through 2012.      Republican leaders engineered a vote on Tuesday evening in which the House voted overwhelmingly not to increase the debt limit. They said that was their way of proving to Democrats that a rise in the debt limit could not pass without spending cuts attached. The Democrats countered that Republicans were risking an adverse market reaction by staging the vote, knowing it would fail.      Stock markets did fall more than 2 percent on Wednesday, but analysts generally attributed the slump to the day’s disheartening economic reports and anticipation that the government’s monthly jobs report on Friday would also be disappointing. ||||| “The heightened polarization over the debt limit has increased the odds of a short-lived default,” Moody’s said in an analysis.      The Obama administration says a failure to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling by Aug. 2 will lead the government to default on some of its obligations. If that happens, Moody’s said it was likely to lower the rating, driving up the cost the U.S. government must pay investors to borrow money.      The AAA rating identifies the United States as one of the world’s safest investments — and has helped the government borrow at extraordinarily cheap rates to finance its operations.      Moody’s warning followed an earlier one from Standard & Poor, another credit rating agency, which lowered the U.S. debt outlook in April to “negative” from “positive,” signaling that a downgrade was possible.      So far, investors have shown little concern about the prospect of default. But Moody’s said that it thinks a deal on raising the debt ceiling is less and less likely.      Moody’s report comes as President Obama and congressional Republicans are in tense negotiations. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met with nearly 100 House freshmen — the vast majority Republicans — to press them for an increase in the debt limit. House freshmen have continued to question his warnings of a catastrophic default if the debt ceiling isn’t raised by Aug. 2.      “At the end of the day, there is no certainty even on the date, from my perspective,” said Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), one of the leaders of the House freshmen. He pointed out that Geithner had earlier given a different date for a possible default.      But Treasury Department officials said the Moody’s report supported Geithner’s warnings about a default on Aug. 2.      “This simply underscores the need for Congress to move quickly to ensure that the United States can meet all of its obligations, while continuing to work on a consensus approach towards long term fiscal balance,” said Mary Miller, assistant Treasury secretary for financial markets.      House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) also found ammunition in the Moody’s report. He noted that it described the discussions over the debt ceiling as an opportune moment for the government to produce a long-range plan for cutting the federal budget deficit. Moody’s said the long-term credit rating would depend on the development of such a plan.      “This report makes clear that if we let this opportunity pass without real deficit reduction, America’s financial standing will be at risk,” Boehner said. “A credible agreement means the spending cuts must exceed the debt limit increase.”      Geithner’s meeting with House freshmen had been scheduled before the Moody’s announcement.      After the session, freshman Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) said that she had drafted a letter to Obama asking for a detailed deficit-reduction plan that could be evaluated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and for a contingency plan in case Congress does not raise the debt ceiling by Aug. 2.      Other Republicans sounded an upbeat note.      “We obviously have a very serious economic situation that we’re in right now, and we’re going to solve it,” said Rep. Austin Scott (Ga.), the House freshman class president. “And as far as we’re concerned, everything that we got in there from him was a step in the right direction, that we’re having an open and honest dialogue on how we move forward.” ||||| WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday issued a mild warning to Congress and the White House over negotiations to lift the debt ceiling, saying that the outlook on the U.S. government’s Triple-A rating could be cut if “substantial” deficit reduction hasn’t occurred.      In what effectively was a warning about issuing a warning, Moody’s said it would place the U.S. government’s rating under review for possible downgrade on the “very small but rising risk of a short-lived default.” The Treasury Department said it would exhaust all funds by Aug. 2 if the debt ceiling is not lifted by then, in which case a default on existing obligations becomes a possibility.      Click to Play ‘Obama has failed America’ Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney kicks off his Republican presidential campaign in New Hampshire with criticism of President Obama.      The rating agency says it’s concerned about the talks. “Although Moody’s fully expected political wrangling prior to an increase in the statutory debt limit, the degree of entrenchment into conflicting positions has exceeded expectations,” the agency said.      And it would likely downgrade the U.S. if a debt ceiling-related default were to occur, probably to the Aa range. “Any loss to bondholders would likely be minimal or non-existent, as Moody’s anticipates that a default would be cured quickly,” Moody’s said.      But the Moody’s announcement goes further into the terms of any deal to lift the debt ceiling.      “The debt limit negotiations represent a real near-term opportunity for agreement on a plan for fiscal consolidation. If this current opportunity passes, Moody’s believes that the likelihood of anything significant being accomplished before the next presidential election is reduced, in part because the two parties each hopes to capture both a congressional majority and the presidency in the 2012 election, after which the winning party could achieve its own agenda,” the rating agency said.      The White House and Congressional Republicans have agreed that any deal to increase the debt ceiling will include spending cuts, though the sides disagree on the scope and nature.      President Barack Obama met with House Democrats on Thursday after a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday.      House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said the Moody’s announcement “reinforces” the point that major spending cuts are needed alongside a debt ceiling increase. The Treasury Department meanwhile said the Moody’s announcement underscores the need for Congress to quickly raise the debt ceiling.      Moody’s rival, Standard & Poor’s, already has put the U.S. Triple-A debt rating under review. See story on Standard & Poor's move.      The bond market so far has shrugged off worries about the U.S. ability to repay debt, as bond yields on 10-year debt on Wednesday sunk below 3% on concerns over stagnating economic growth.      Steve Goldstein is MarketWatch's Washington bureau chief. ||||| Summary:","output":"Moody's warned of putting the US government's credit rating under review for a possible downgrade if lawmakers do not make progress on raising the debt ceiling. This comes after rival Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on America's ability to repay its debts in April. The possible downgrade is tied to the risk of a short-lived default, which has increased with the stalemate in debt negotiations. Moody's stresses the importance of both parties working together for substantial and credible long-term deficit reduction to stabilize and eventually lower the government's debt ratios, including the ratio of debt to GDP."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Being less than perfectly well-dressed in a business setting can result in a feeling of great discomfort that may well require treatment to eliminate (remove). And the sad truth is that \\"clothing mismatches\\" on the job can ruin the day of the person who is wearing the inappropriate attire --and the people with whom he or she comes in contact. Offices vary when it comes to dress codes. Some businesses have very high standards for their employees and set strict guidelines for office attire, while others maintain a more relaxed attitude. However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment. Your attire should reflect both your environment and your position. A senior vice president has a different image to maintain than that of a secretary or sales assistant. Like it or not, you will be judged by your personal appearance. This is never more apparent than on _ , when what you wear can say more about you than any business suit ever could. In fact, people will pay more attention to what you wear on dress-down days than on \\"business professional\\" days. Thus, when dressing in \\"business casual\\" clothes, try to put some good taste into your wardrobe choices, and recognize that the \\"real\\" definition of business casual is to dress just one notch  down from what you would normally wear of business-professional attire days. Remember, there are borders between your career and our social life. You should dress one way for play and another way when you mean business.

Available options: i. yes. ii. it is not possible to tell. iii. no.","output":"The premise \\"They're too different\\" does indeed tell us something about the hypothesis in consideration, \\"They are not similar enough for this task.\\" That's because the premise and the hypothesis are significantly linked. The term \\"too different\\" in the premise means the gap or difference between the subjects (probably two things or people) in question is overly significant or considerable. Meanwhile, the expression \\"not similar enough for this task\\" in the hypothesis suggests there's a need for close resemblance or similarity, which isn't present.  Hence, we can say there's a strong relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise of being \\"too different\\" generates enough evidence to entail the hypothesis \\"They are not similar enough for this task.\\" This connection arises because both scenarios highlight a profound lack of resemblance, similarity, or equivalency.  Therefore, if the premise holds true, it's very likely that the hypothesis is true for the same reason. This particular reasoning falls into the premise-logical-consequence relationship, where a true premise directly influences the validity of a hypothesis or conclusion.

The Antenna itself is unusable. Is this product review negative? pick from the following. [-] Yes [-] No Answer:","output":"Yes The review of the DX antenna can be categorized as negative. The reason being that the consumer has expressed dissatisfaction with more than one aspect of their purchaser's journey. Firstly, the customer points out the poor packaging, a crucial aspect of any good delivery system. Effective packaging not only secures the product during transportation but also boosts the customer's perception of the business. Poor packaging, therefore, not only poses a risk to the product being delivered in optimal condition but also erodes consumer trust. It would seem that in this case, the poor packaging rendered a negative impression on the customer. Secondly, the customer states that the product was \\"damaged when received,\\" to the extent that the antenna was unusable. This statement from the customer implies that the product's primary purpose couldn't be fulfilled due to the damage it incurred, which is a strong negative sentiment. This drives the point that the customer's needs and wants were not satisfied by the purchase. This also suggests a failure in delivery and quality control processes that let a damaged product be shipped and delivered to the customer. Therefore, considering these significant elements of dissatisfaction - namely, the poor packaging and the delivery of a damaged, unusable product, this product review can comprehensively be classified as negative. It reflects poorly on the seller, the product itself, and the associated delivery method. It may deter potential customers from buying this product and affect the seller's reputation negatively. It's recommended that the seller addresses such buyer's concerns promptly and effectively to recover lost trust and improve their service."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Usage: [{'first': 56, 'second': -44}, {'first': 15, 'second': -77}] Explanation: In the sample input provided, we have a list that contains two dictionaries.

Usage: [{'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: The list has been sorted based on the 'first' key values. The dictionary with 'first': 15 comes before the one with 'first': 56. Part #3: If there is two dictionaries with the same 'first' value then sort them by their 'second' key. Usage: [{'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 15, 'second': 10}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: If there were two dictionaries with the same 'first' value, like 15 in this example, then the one with the smaller 'second' value (-77) comes before the one with the larger 'second' value (10). Part #4: Negative numbers should come before positive numbers. Usage: [{'first': -8, 'second': -3}, {'first': 0, 'second': 2}, {'first': 15, 'second': -77}, {'first': 56, 'second': -44}] Explanation: When sorting the list of dictionaries both based on 'first' and 'second' key values, the negative numbers should come before the positive numbers.

There are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine. The summer in Australia is from December to February, so going to the beach in December is very popular among Australians. Easter in March is another important holiday in the year. It actually combines  \\"Good Friday\\" and \\"Easter Monday\\". Almost every shop closes on Good Friday. And people usually go to see Easter Show.

Michael John Harrison (born 26 July 1945), known for publication purposes primarily as M. John Harrison, is an English author and literary critic. His work includes the Viriconium sequence of novels and short stories (1971-1984), Climbers (1989), and the Kefahuchi Tract trilogy, which consists of Light (2002), Nova Swing (2006) and Empty Space (2012). He is widely considered one of the major stylists of modern fantasy and science fiction, and a \\"genre contrarian\\". The Times Literary Supplement described him as 'a singular stylist' and the Literary Review called him 'a witty and truly imaginative writer'. Harrison was born in Rugby, Warwickshire, in 1945 to an engineering family. His father died when he was a teenager and he found himself \\"bored, alienated, resentful and entrapped\\", playing truant from Dunsmore School (now Ashlawn School). An English teacher introduced him to George Bernard Shaw which resulted in an interest in polemic. He ended school during 1963 at age 18; he worked at various times as a groom (for the Atherstone Hunt), a student teacher (1963-65), and a clerk for the Royal Masonic Charity Institute, London (1966). His hobbies included electric guitars and writing pastiches of H. H. Munro.  His first short story was published during 1966 by Kyril Bonfiglioli at Science Fantasy magazine, on the strength of which he relocated to London. He there met Michael Moorcock, who was editing New Worlds magazine. He began writing reviews and short fiction for New Worlds, and by 1968 he was appointed books editor. Harrison was critical of what he perceived as the complacency of much genre fiction of the time. During 1970, Harrison scripted comic stories illustrated by R.G. Jones for such forums as Cyclops and Finger. An illustration by Jones appears in the first edition of Harrison's The Committed Men (1971).  In an interview with Zone magazine, Harrison says \\"I liked anything bizarre, from being about four years old. I started on Dan Dare and worked up to the Absurdists. At 15 you could catch me with a pile of books that contained an Alfred Bester, a Samuel Beckett, a Charles Williams, the two or three available J. G. Ballards, On the Road by Jack Kerouac, some Keats, some Allen Ginsberg, maybe a Thorne Smith.

Deal became the bassist and backing vocalist for Pixies in January 1986, after answering an advertisement in the Boston Phoenix that said, \\"\\"Band seeks bassist into Husker Du and Peter, Paul and Mary. Please - no chops.\\" Deal was the only person to call them, even though her main instrument was guitar. She borrowed her sister Kelley's bass guitar to use in the band. To complete the lineup, she suggested they hire David Lovering as drummer, a friend of her husband, whom she met at her wedding reception. For the release of the band's first recording Come on Pilgrim (1987), Deal used the nom de disque \\"Mrs. John Murphy\\" in the liner notes. She chose the name as an ironic feminist joke, after conversing with a lady who wished to be called only by her husband's name as a form of respect.  For Surfer Rosa (1988), Deal sang lead vocals on the album's only single, \\"Gigantic\\" ( sample ), which she co-wrote with Black Francis. Doolittle followed a year later, with Deal contributing the song \\"Silver\\" and appearing on slide guitar. By this time, however, tensions began to develop between her and Francis, with bickering and standoffs between the two marring the album's recording sessions.

Results: Thirty-seven % (22/60) of the dogs and 75% (50/67) of the cats were seropositive to L. infantum with a significantly higher seropositivity rate in the cat population (χ 2 = 42.160, P < 0.0001). Twenty-five percent (15/60) of the dogs were positive for Leishmania by blood PCR, 12% by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t (12) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t (11) = − 3.186580, P < 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (χ 2 = 0.506, P = 0.777). A higher percentage of Leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to Leishmania-positive cats (100 vs 52.8%, χ 2 =15.242, P < 0.0001). Phlebotomus perfiliewi, a proven vector of L. infantum, comprised 92% of trapped sand flies. Comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and L. infantum under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity, dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads, and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats.   Title: Leishmania infection in cats and dogs housed together in an animal shelter reveals a higher parasite load in infected dogs despite a greater seroprevalence among cats","output":"True Justification: The title \\"Leishmania infection in cats and dogs housed together in an animal shelter reveals a higher parasite load in infected dogs despite a greater seroprevalence among cats\\" accurately summarizes the main points from the paragraph. The paragraph discusses the study conducted in an animal shelter in Israel, the prevalence of Leishmania infection in both cats and dogs, and the differences in parasite loads between the two populations. The title also reflects the findings of the study, highlighting the higher parasite load in dogs despite greater seroprevalence among cats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
