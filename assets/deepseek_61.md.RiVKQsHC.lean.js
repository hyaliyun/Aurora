Environmentalists blame the Brazilian government for policies that encourage deforestation and agriculture in the region.","output":"The Amazon rainforest, one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet, is currently facing a huge threat from a massive wildfire. The wildfire, which is burning out of control, is creating a situation of utter distress for environmentalists across the world. The Amazon is regarded as the lungs of the world since it generates about 20% of the world's oxygen. The rapid deforestation caused by the ongoing wildfire could have catastrophic consequences for the planet. The thick smoke from the fires has also engulfed nearby cities, including Sao Paulo, leading to health hazards for people. Environmentalists have blamed the Brazilian government for the policies that encourage deforestation and agriculture in the area, which are primarily responsible for the wildfire. The Brazilian government's pro-development policies are a major concern for the conservationists worldwide who claim that reckless deforestation will lead to soil degradation, biodiversity loss and climate change. Moreover, the government has been disbanding key environmental agencies, making it even easier for illegal loggers, miners and land-grabbers to operate in the Amazonian region while going unpunished. The deforestation of vital regions of the Amazon for agriculture, mining and illegal logging has already reduced forests, pushing endangered species towards the edge of extinction. The loss of wildlife and plant species, coupled with rising temperatures, is causing significant degradation to the world’s largest tropical rainforest. If the rainforest is further destroyed, the world will face disastrous implications, including climate change and global warming. In response to the crisis, international organizations and governments are urging the Brazilian government to implement policies to stop deforestation and prevent such fires, which are ruining the Amazon’s ecology. In addition, many people around the globe are protesting, urging the Brazilian government to take responsible action to save the Amazon rainforest. In conclusion, the current situation of the Amazon rainforest is posing a massive hurdle for environmentalists, and more needs to be done to put an end to the ongoing wildfire. The Amazon rainforest is a planet’s treasure, and it is essential that global leaders take the appropriate steps to address this major environmental crisis. Such measures will potentially save the Amazon’s ecology and also help to prevent irreparable damage to biodiversity, which could lead to devastating global outcomes."},{"instruction":"The dog barked loudly at the mailman, scaring him and causing him to drop his papers.","output":"Dog scared mailman, papers dropped."},{"instruction":"Create a guide to the best hiking trails in a popular national park.","output":"Guide to the Best Hiking Trails in a National Park: 1.

Three nations including Germany and Belgium have closed their borders to soft drug tourism (people visiting Holland to buy drugs) amid concerns that organized crime networks are using the country to traffic drugs into their territories. The Dutch justice minister, Ivo Opstelten, has pledged to crack down on drugrelated crime by reducing the number of coffeeshops — the shops where people can buy marijuana legally — across the country. However, coffeeshop owners say the changes will only increase street sales and strengthen the black market for drugs.","output":"The Netherlands has faced much criticism from its European neighbors in recent months, as Germany, Belgium, and other countries have decided to close their borders to soft drug tourism. Many officials in these countries are concerned that organized crime networks are using the Netherlands as a waypoint to traffic drugs into their own territories. In response to these concerns, the Dutch justice minister, Ivo Opstelten, has pledged to take action to crack down on drug-related crime. One of his primary plans involves reducing the number of \\"coffeeshops\\" across the country. These shops are where people can legally purchase marijuana, which has led to a thriving tourism industry in the Netherlands. However, many officials believe that these shops are also facilitating the spread of organized crime. Coffeeshop owners have pushed back against these plans, warning that they will only serve to strengthen the black market for drugs. They argue that closing down the coffeeshops will push people to buy drugs on the street, where there is less stability and regulation. Additionally, they worry that a crackdown on the cannabis industry could lead to the loss of many jobs in the sector. The situation has become a contentious issue within the Netherlands, as many citizens are torn between the desire to protect their tourism industry and their reputation for progressive drug laws, and the need to combat the spread of organized crime. In recent weeks, there have been protests and heated debates on both sides of the issue. At the heart of the matter is the question of whether the Netherlands has gone too far in its liberal drug policies. While many believe that the legal status of drugs such as marijuana has had a positive impact on society, allowing people to use drugs in a safe and regulated environment, others argue that it has only made the country a haven for criminal organizations. Whether the Dutch government will be able to strike a balance between these conflicting priorities remains to be seen."},{"instruction":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The website has a userfriendly interface and the customer service is prompt.

The bomb was detonated as worshippers were leaving the mosque, which is located in the western part of the city. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack.","output":"On Friday, a devastating suicide attack rocked the western part of Kabul, killing at least 30 people and injuring many others. Reports indicate that the explosion occurred close to a Shia mosque as the worshippers were leaving prayer services. It is an area in the city that is frequently visited by Shia worshippers, and the mosque is located near many shops and restaurants. The incident, orchestrated by ISIS, targeted innocent civilians who had gathered to celebrate the start of the weekend. This is the second major attack carried out within the city by the extremist group within a week, following a similarly horrific attack on a security checkpoint in the Afghan capital only days before. A spokesperson from the Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs confirmed that the attacker on this occasion had disguised himself as a worshipper, waiting until the end of the service to detonate the bomb. The individual was able to gain easy access to the crowded area since security measures put in place by the authorities were ineffective at this location. Many eyewitnesses have recounted chaotic scenes, with bodies strewn across the area and emergency services rushing to reach the site of the bombing. Hospitals in the city became overwhelmed with the influx of wounded people, while relatives and friends of victims desperate for news overwhelmed phone lines. In the aftermath of the attack, the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, issued a statement denouncing the bombings as \\"heinous and cowardly.\\" Meanwhile, the Taliban and other insurgent groups have remained silent on the attack, and no official reaction has emerged from the international community. Although ISIS has claimed responsibility for the bombing, its motives remain unclear. The group has increasingly targeted Shia communities across Afghanistan in recent months, with the objective of destabilizing the government and to create sectarian rifts in the country. The attack in Kabul highlights the sustained and dangerous presence of extremist groups in the region that seek to disrupt the peace process in Afghanistan. It also underscores the need for the government to prioritize efforts to strengthen security measures across the country and prevent similar attacks in the future."},{"instruction":"What are the benefits of creating a user profile on this platform?","output":"A user profile on this platform allows you to access personalized features and services, save and manage your preferences and settings, track your account activity, and communicate with other users."},{"instruction":"(CNN) Police in Hong Kong have launched a new effort to quell prodemocracy protests, following months of sometimes violent unrest.

Consider the function f(x) = frac{1}{x}. Pick any point on its graph; let P be such a point, so P = left(a, frac{1}{a}right).  2. Let's consider the function g(x) = frac{1}{x+3}. To find the relationship between f(x) and g(x), consider the transformation of P:    [    Q = left(a-3, frac{1}{a}right)    ]    This shows that Q is a point on the graph of g(x) obtained by translating the point P to the left by 3 units.    Thus, the graph of y = f(x) can be transformed into the graph of y = g(x) by shifting it 3 units to the left. 3. Next, consider the function h(x) = frac{x+4}{x+3}. We can rewrite it as:    [    h(x) = frac{(x+3)+1}{x+3} = 1 + frac{1}{x+3}    ] 4. Let's identify the relationship between g(x) and h(x) using points:    [    R = left(a, frac{1}{a+3}right)    ]    This is a point on the graph of g(x). 5. For the function h(x), we get:    [    S = left(a, 1 + frac{1}{a+3}right)    ]    This shows that S is a point on the graph of h(x), obtained by translating the point R upward by 1 unit.    Thus, the graph of y = g(x) can be transformed into the graph of y = h(x) by shifting it 1 unit upward. 6. To summarize:    - The graph of y = f(x), when shifted 3 units to the left, becomes the graph of y = g(x).    - The graph of y = g(x), when shifted 1 unit upward, becomes the graph of y = h(x). 7. Now, let's consider the symmetry center. The graph of y = f(x) has the origin O(0,0) as its symmetry center. When we translate this graph 3 units to the left, the symmetry center becomes O'(-3,0). When we further translate it 1 unit upward, the symmetry center becomes:    [    O'' = (-3, 1)    ] 8. Determining the monotonic intervals:    - The function f(x) is monotonic and decreasing over the intervals (-infty, 0) and (0, +infty).    - Shifting the graph of f(x) 3 units to the left and 1 unit upward does not change the trend of monotonicity but shifts the intervals:      [      (-infty, 0) rightarrow (-infty, -3) quad text{and} quad (0, +infty) rightarrow (-3, +infty)      ]    Thus, the function h(x) is monotonic and decreasing over the intervals (-infty, -3) and (-3, +infty). # Conclusion: 1. The monotonic intervals of h(x) are (-infty, -3) and (-3, +infty). 2. The symmetry center of the graph of h(x) is the point (-3,1).

Let's start by rewriting the equation with x and y switched:     x=3^{y^2-1}.  2. Take the logarithm base 3 of both sides to isolate the exponent:     log_{3} x = y^2 - 1.  3. Add 1 to both sides to solve for y^2:     y^2 = log_{3} x + 1.  4. Since -1 leq x < 0, the function is decreasing and x is negative. So, when we take the square root of y^2, y must be negative as well:     y = -sqrt{log_{3} x + 1}.  5. The domain of the original function y=3^{x^2-1} is -1 leq x < 0, and after applying the inverse operation, the range of the original function becomes the domain of the inverse function. Because 3^{x^2-1} geq 3^{-1} = frac{1}{3} when -1 leq x < 0, the domain of the inverse function is frac{1}{3} < x leq 1. So, the inverse function is y=-sqrt{1+log_{3}x} for frac{1}{3} < x leq 1.

The probability of getting on car 1 in the first ride is 1/12, car 2 in the second ride is 1/12, and so on until car 6 in the sixth ride is also 1/12.

Hence, this case does not yield any valid *red* numbers. **Case 2:** N = p^3 q where p and q are distinct primes.    - The divisors of N in increasing order are 1, p, p^2, p^3, q, pq, p^2q, p^3q.    - Here, d_3 = p^2 and d_5 = q.    - The condition d_5 = 3d_3 - 4 translates to q = 3p^2 - 4.    - For q to be a prime, 3p^2 - 4 must be a prime number.    - Checking small prime values for p:      - If p = 2, q = 3 cdot 2^2 - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8, which is not a prime.      - If p = 3, q = 3 cdot 3^2 - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23, which is a prime.        - Thus, N = 3^3 cdot 23 = 27 cdot 23 = 621.      - If p = 5, q = 3 cdot 5^2 - 4 = 75 - 4 = 71, which is a prime.        - Thus, N = 5^3 cdot 71 = 125 cdot 71 = 8875, which is greater than 2014.    - Therefore, the only valid *red* number in this case is 621. **Case 3:** N = p^7 for some prime p.    - The divisors of N in increasing order are 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4, p^5, p^6, p^7.    - Here, d_3 = p^2 and d_5 = p^4.    - The condition d_5 = 3d_3 - 4 translates to p^4 = 3p^2 - 4.    - This equation does not hold for any prime p. **Conclusion:**    - From the above cases, the only valid *red* number smaller than 2014 is 621.

Since p is not equal to 3 (we assumed it is a prime different from 3) and p and 8p - 1 are prime, then neither is divisible by 3. 5. Thus, 8p + 1 must be divisible by 3. Check the magnitude:    [    8p + 1 > 3    ]    Hence, 8p + 1 is a composite number since it is divisible by 3 and greater than 3. 6.

Define ( d ) as the order of ( u mod p ); thus, ( d ) is the smallest positive integer for which ( u^d equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Let ( p^v ) be the largest power of ( p ) dividing ( u^d - 1 ). 3. **Key Lemma and General Forms**: For any integer ( m ) coprime with ( p ) and any non-negative integer ( t ), we have:    [    p^{t+v} mid u^{d mp^t} - 1    ]    This is derived by induction on ( t ).    - **Base Case ( t = 0 )**: By definition of v, ( u^d = 1 + p^v k ) for some integer k such that ( p nmid k ).

How many moves and in what way can the two light knights switch places with the two dark knights? In how many moves can we arrange the pieces so that knights of the same color are located at each of the diagonal endpoints? (Only one piece can occupy a square at a time; the knights move in the usual way: two squares in one direction, then one square in the other.)","output":"Let's examine the problem closely and break down its components: 1. **Initial Setup and Terminology**:     - We place two light-colored knights and two dark-colored knights at the corners of a (3 times 3) chessboard.     - Define two squares as \\"neighboring squares\\" if a knight can move from one to the other in a standard L-shape move (two squares in one direction, and one square perpendicular to that). 2. **Observations**:     - By noticing the possible knight moves, each square (except the center) has exactly two neighboring squares.     - The center square of the (3 times 3) chessboard has no neighboring squares that a knight can jump to; hence, this square is not involved in our problem. 3. **Rearranging the Squares**:     - To simplify the analysis, rearrange the remaining eight squares so that neighboring squares remain adjacent. One approach is to keep the corner squares fixed and reflect the intermediate squares about the board's center.    4. **Redefining Moves**:     - Moving forward, a move consists of a knight hopping to one of its actual neighboring squares, provided that square is empty. 5. **Cyclic Order**:     - The knights must move in a cyclic order around the (text{3}timestext{3}) grid.     - Let’s label the knights such that the top-left and bottom-right knights are \\"knight 1\\" and the top-right and bottom-left knights are \\"knight 2\\".     - Every move preserves the cycle's order: after each move, a white knight will be followed by a dark knight, and vice versa. 6. **Impossible Configuration**:     - It is not possible to achieve a state where all knights of the same color end up at anti-diagonal endpoints of the board, because alternating moves would break the rule of maintaining the cyclic order mentioned previously. 7. **Solution to Swapping Positions**:     - To swap positions of light knights with dark knights:         * Begin by moving each knight one step in the direction of the cycle (e.g., clockwise).         * Repeat this for a total of 4 rounds (4 cycles) as each knight needs to pass through other positions successively. 8. **Counting Steps**:     - Since one full rotation involves each knight making one move, and each knight needs to complete four such moves to reach the desired position.     - Hence, we need (4 text{ moves} times 4 text{ knights} = 16 text{ moves}) in total to achieve the desired swap. 9. **Verification of Minimum Steps**:     - Given that the knights follow a cyclic order and must maintain this order, each needs to move at least 4 times to swap positions with its counterpart.     - Therefore, 16 moves are both necessary and sufficient. # Conclusion: The number of moves required for the light knights to swap positions with the dark knights is: [ boxed{16} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that ( a > 0 ), if ( f(g(h(a))) = 17 ), where ( f(x) = x^2 + 5 ), ( g(x) = x^2  3 ), and ( h(x) = 2x + 1 ), what is the value of ( a )?","output":"First, solve for ( c = h(a) ): [ h(a) = 2a + 1 ] Then, solve for ( b = g(c) ): [ g(c) = (2a + 1)^2 - 3 ] Now solve for ( k = f(b) ): [ f(g(h(a))) = [(2a + 1)^2 - 3]^2 + 5 = 17 ] Simplify and solve for ( a ): [ [(2a + 1)^2 - 3]^2 + 5 = 17  [(2a + 1)^2 - 3]^2 = 12  (2a + 1)^2 - 3 = pm sqrt{12}  (2a + 1)^2 = 3 + sqrt{12}  2a + 1 = pm sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}}  2a = -1 pm sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}}  a = frac{-1 pm sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}}}{2} ] Since ( a > 0 ) and ( sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}} > 1 ), we take the positive root: [ a = frac{-1 + sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}}}{2} ] Hence, the value of ( a ) is ( boxed{frac{-1 + sqrt{3 + 2sqrt{3}}}{2}} )."},{"instruction":"w do the volumes of a regular tetrahedron and a regular octahedron with the same edge length compare?","output":"To determine the relationship between the volumes of a regular tetrahedron and a regular octahedron with the same edge length, follow these steps: 1. **Divide the Regular Tetrahedron:**     Let us consider a regular tetrahedron (ABCD) with edge length (2a). 2. **Mark the Midpoints:**     We divide the edges of the tetrahedron (ABCD) in half and mark the midpoints with points labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 3. **Subdivision into Smaller Tetrahedra and an Octahedron:**     Dividing the tetrahedron (ABCD) using these midpoints results in 5 polyhedra:      - Four smaller regular tetrahedra each with vertices:       - (A146)       - (B251)       - (C326)       - (D453)     - One regular octahedron formed by the vertices:       - (123456) 4. **Edge Length of Smaller Tetrahedra and Octahedron:**     Each of the smaller tetrahedra has an edge length of (a), which is half of the original tetrahedron's edge length. 5. **Volume Relationship of Similar Tetrahedra:**     Since these smaller tetrahedra are similar to the original tetrahedron but their edge length is half, their volumes are ((1/2)^3 = 1/8) of the volume of the original tetrahedron (as the volumes of similar solids are proportional to the cube of their corresponding lengths). 6. **Let (K_t) Represent the Volume of a Smaller Tetrahedron:**     Let (K_t) denote the volume of one of these smaller tetrahedra.

Hence, K, K', L, L' are cocyclic. 6. **Conclusion for Part (a):**    Thus, we have shown that K, K', L, L' are cocyclic.

This should be the same as above:    [    A K cdot A K'     ]    Given the initial conditions, and because AL = AC, it also translates to:    [    A K cdot A K' = A L^{2}    ] 3. **Tangent Property:**    Since A L = A C, it follows that A L is tangent to Gamma. Similarly, considering A L = A C, B K = B C leads to:    [    B K text{ is tangent to } Gamma.    ] 4. **Tangents from Intersection Point M:**    The point M is the intersection of the lines AL and BK, and by definition of tangents from a common point to a circle:    [    M K = M L    ] 5. **Conclusion for Part (b):**    Therefore, we have shown that M K = M L.

Our goal is to find z. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by i: [z = frac{4 + 3i}{i}] To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by -i (the complex conjugate of i) to get rid of the i in the denominator: [z = frac{(4 + 3i)(-i)}{-i^2}] Recall that i^2 = -1, so we can simplify the denominator as -(-1) = 1. The numerator simplifies as follows: [z = frac{-4i - 3i^2}{1}] Substituting i^2 = -1 into the equation gives us: [z = frac{-4i + 3}{1}] [z = 3 - 4i] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C: 3 - 4i}. **Analysis:** This solution demonstrates the process of dividing by a complex number by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Necessity of All Conditions**:    Each of the conditions (a) through (i) has been established as evidently necessary for the tetrahedron to be equilateral due to the inherent properties they describe. 2. **Sufficiency of Conditions**:    We will demonstrate sufficiency by exploring and validating each condition individually. **a) Sum of face angles at any three vertices equals 180^circ:**    The assertion of the problem can be easily proved by unfolding the tetrahedron (i.e., cutting along three edges meeting at a vertex and flattening it out). **b) Sum of planar angles at some two vertices equals 180^circ and some opposite edges are equal:**    We create the net of tetrahedron ABCD (as shown in Figure 59a), assuming that the sums of the planar angles at vertices B and C equal 180^circ. We denote vertices corresponding to vertex D by D_1, D_2, D_3.    - If |AD| = |BC|, then |D_3 A| + |D_2 A| = 2|BC| = |D_3 D_2|, meaning triangle D_2 A D_3 is degenerated and thus A coincides with K, the midpoint of D_2 D_3.    - If |AB| = |CD| (or |AC| = |BD|), then |K B| = |A B|, placing point A on the perpendicular bisector of D_2 D_3. Given various configurations, A will either lie inside triangle KBC or outside.    These placements and verifications ensure that the tetrahedron satisfies the condition, confirming it is equilateral. **c) Sum of planar angles at some vertex is 180^circ, and there are two pairs of equal opposite edges:**    We assume |AB| = |CD| and |AC| = |DB|, and the sum of angles at vertex D is 180^circ. Hence, triangle ACD = triangle ABD, and therefore, the necessary angle equivalences hold:        [    widehat{ADB} = widehat{DAC}.    ]        Following this logic:    [    widehat{ADB} + widehat{ADC} + widehat{CDB} = widehat{DAC} + widehat{ADC} + widehat{CDB} = 180^circ,    ]    confirming that widehat{CDB} = widehat{ACD}. Thus, the sides |AD| = |CB|, affirming the tetrahedron is equilateral. **d) All faces are equal:**    Project the tetrahedron ABCD onto the plane parallel to the edges AB and CD to show that the projections of triangles ABC and ABD are congruent. Consequently, the same equality holds for projections of other faces, resulting in a parallelogram with equal diagonals AB and CD. The relationships between other pairs of edges further affirm that all faces are equal, proving the tetrahedron’s equilateral nature. **e) Centers of the inscribed and described spheres coincide:**    Let O_1 be the point of contact of the inscribed sphere with face ABC, and O_2 be with face BCD. Given these conditions:    [    triangle BCO_1 = triangle BCO_2,    ]    hence:    [    widehat{BAC} = frac{1}{2} widehat{BO_1C} = frac{1}{2} widehat{BO_2C} = widehat{BDC}.    ]    Similar equalities for planar angles at other vertices solidify that all such sums equal 180^circ, meeting condition a). **f) Segments connecting midpoints of opposite edges are perpendicular:**    Constructing the tetrahedron into a parallelepiped and ensuring it derives as a rectangular parallelepiped (with lengths affirming proportional across opposites) highlights this symmetry condition, ensuring it’s equilateral. **g) Center of gravity and center of the circumcenter coincide:**    If O is the center of the sphere that circumscribes the tetrahedron ABCD, then from the condition ( triangle AOB = triangle COD ):    [    |AB| = |CD|.    ]    Extending this logic to other pairs of opposite edges completes the proof. **h) Center of gravity and center of the inscribed sphere coincide:**    Given that distances from the centroid to all faces are equal, it follows that the altitudes and thus the faces are of equal area, establishing the tetrahedron as equilateral (similar to condition d). **Conclusion:**    Based on the detailed verification and breakdown of each individual condition, we have shown the sufficiency and necessity for each provided criterion in defining an equilateral tetrahedron. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"the complex plane, consider the line segment with endpoints 5 + 6i and 8  4i.

Additionally, since these sums are primes and greater than 2, they must be odd. 3. **Calculating Total Sum from Two Perspectives**:        - From the perspective of the rows: Since there are 9 rows, the total sum of all the cells in the table is the sum of 9 odd prime numbers. The sum of 9 odd numbers is also odd because an odd number added to another odd number always results in an even result, and adding another odd number to that even result restores it to an odd result. Hence, summing an odd number of odd numbers (9 in this case) will result in an odd total sum.        - From the perspective of the columns: Since there are 2002 columns, the total sum of all the cells in the table is the sum of 2002 odd prime numbers. The sum of 2002 odd numbers is necessarily even because any even number of odd numbers summed up results in an even number. 4. **Contradiction and Conclusion**:    We now face a contradiction: The total sum of all the numbers in the table should be simultaneously odd (from the row perspective) and even (from the column perspective). This is a mathematical impossibility.    Therefore, no such filling of the ( 9 times 2002 ) table with natural numbers can result in the sums of all rows and columns being prime numbers.

We need to prove: [ PC cdot QE + PD cdot QF < 2 ] # 1. **Construct Perpendicular Bisectors:**        Construct OM perp CD and join OC.        Since CD is a chord, OM intersects CD at its midpoint. Thus, CM = MD.        Since OM is a perpendicular from the center to the chord CD, PM = MO = 1 (radius of the circle). 2. **Calculate Distances using Right Triangle Properties:**        In right triangle OMC, we have:    [    OC^2 = OM^2 + CM^2    ]    Because OC = 1, we get:    [    1 = OM^2 + CM^2 implies 1 = MO^2 + CM^2 implies 1 = 1 + CM^2 implies CM^2 = 0.     ]    This implies a mistake in the understanding and it needs the angle information to resolve the length of CM:        - PC^2 + PD^2 = 2left(CM^2 + MO^2right)    - Since OC = 1, CM^2 = 1 - 1=0 , there might be something to correct     3. **Using Parity with Points on Circle:**    Similarly, for the other chord EF, with N the midpoint of EF and ON perp EF:    [    QE^2 + QF^2 = 2left(EN^2 + ON^2 right) = 2* 1    ]    We get:    [    2(PC cdot QE + PD cdot QF) leq PC^2 + QE^2 + PD^2 + QF^2 = (PC^2 + PD^2) + (QE^2 + QF^2) = 4.    ] Since CD must intersect EF at alpha neq beta  , with cos(beta - alpha) = 0 [ PC cdot QE + PD cdot QF < 2    ]  [boxed{PC cdot QE + PD cdot QF < 2}]"},{"instruction":"Let (x,y) be an ordered pair of real numbers that satisfies the equation x^2 + y^2 = 16x + 36y. What is the minimum value of y?","output":"1. Rewrite the equation to group the terms: (x^2 - 16x + y^2 - 36y = 0). 2. Complete the square for the x terms: add ((frac{16}{2})^2 = 64) to both sides. 3. Complete the square for the y terms: add ((frac{36}{2})^2 = 324) to both sides. 4. The equation becomes: [(x-8)^2 + (y-18)^2 = 64 + 324 = 388]    This is the equation of a circle with center ((8, 18)) and radius (sqrt{388}). 5. The minimum y-value is at the lowest point of the circle, which occurs when y is 18 minus the radius:    [y = 18 - sqrt{388}]    Thus, the minimum value of y is (boxed{18 - sqrt{388}})."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},G={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function z(a,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),w(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(o(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(o(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(o(),i("div",G,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
