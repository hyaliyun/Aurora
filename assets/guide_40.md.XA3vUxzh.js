To find the rectangle with the maximum area, we assert that E should be the midpoint of the arc B to C, denoted as E_0.

This gives us the system of equations:    [    left{begin{array}{l}    a + 2b = 400     2a + b = 350    end{array}right.    ] 2. **Solving the system of equations:**    Solving this system, we find:    [    left{begin{array}{l}    a = 100     b = 150    end{array}right.    ]    This means the profit from selling each type A computer is 100 yuan and from each type B computer is 150 yuan. 3. **Expressing total profit as a function of x:**    Let x be the quantity of type A computers purchased. The total profit y in yuan from selling these 100 computers can be expressed as:    [    y = 100x + 150(100 - x) = -50x + 15000    ] 4. **Maximizing the total profit:**    Given the constraint that the quantity of type B computers (100 - x) does not exceed twice the quantity of type A computers (2x), we have:    [    100 - x leqslant 2x implies x geqslant 33frac{1}{3}    ]    Since the coefficient of x in the profit function y = -50x + 15000 is negative, the profit decreases as x increases. Therefore, to maximize profit, we choose the smallest integer value of x that satisfies the constraint, which is x = 34. This corresponds to purchasing 34 units of type A computers and 66 units of type B computers.    The maximum profit scenario is thus encapsulated as:    [    boxed{x = 34, ; 100 - x = 66}    ]  Part 2: Maximizing Profit with Price Adjustment 1. **Adjusting for the price reduction:**    With the manufacturer reducing the factory price of type A computers by m yuan, the total profit becomes:    [    y = (100 + m)x + 150(100 - x) = (m - 50)x + 15000    ] 2. **Considering the constraints and maximizing profit:**    Given the constraint 33frac{1}{3} leqslant x leqslant 70:    - For 0 < m < 50, the profit decreases as x increases, so the maximum profit is obtained when x = 34, corresponding to purchasing 34 units of type A computers and 66 units of type B computers.    - When m = 50, the profit function simplifies to y = 15000, independent of x. Thus, any quantity of type A computers that satisfies 33frac{1}{3} leqslant x leqslant 70 will maximize the profit.    The purchasing plan for maximizing profit, therefore, is encapsulated as:    [    boxed{text{For } 0 < m < 50: x = 34, ; 100 - x = 66; quad text{For } m = 50: 33frac{1}{3} leqslant x leqslant 70}    ]"},{"instruction":"w many Sundays can there be in a month at most?

An odd function satisfies the condition f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain. We also know that tan(x) is an odd function and cos(x + m) is an even function when m is a constant. However, for f(x) to be odd as a sum of tan(x) and cos(x + m), cos(x + m) must not remain even. This will occur if and only if cos(x + m) acts like an odd function about x = 0. The cosine function is symmetric about x = 0, so cos(x + m) will act like an odd function if m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k is an integer. We also use the property of odd functions that f(0) = 0: f(0) = tan(0) + cos(m) = cos(m) = 0. The cosine function is zero at m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi for k an integer. Therefore: m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, quad k in mathbb{Z}.  Next, we solve the inequality m^2 - 3m - 10 < 0.

Similarly, define omega_b for the vertices B and C. 2. **Geometric properties**:    - The circle Omega_a is perpendicular to Omega. This reflects symmetry and perpendicularity of angle bisectors to the sides of the triangle.    - omega_a, being the Apollonian circle symmetric to Omega_a, will also be perpendicular to Omega.      - omega_a can be described as the locus of points X where the ratio ( frac{BX}{CX} = frac{BA}{CA} ).    - Similarly, omega_b can be described as the locus of points Y where the ratio ( frac{YA}{XC} = frac{YB}{XA} ). 3. **Common points and inversion properties**:    - Both omega_a and omega_b intersect in specific points with unique ratios relative to triangle sides.    - Inversion relative to Omega will map points conserving these specific ratios. This property ensures that the common tangent behavior translates to tangencies when intersecting Omega. 4. **Ptolemy's Theorem application**:    - If omega_a and omega_b are tangent, then there must exist a common point X on Omega such that the lengths satisfy Ptolemy’s relation in cyclic quadrilateral context:      - This gives us, for some point X common to omega_a and omega_b, a proportional relationship involving AX, BX, and CX relative to the sides of triangle ABC. 5. **Proportionality and sides relationship**:    - Given the tangency at some X, Ptolemy’s theorem tied to a cyclic quadrilateral ABXC implies:      [      AX cdot BC + BX cdot CA = CX cdot AB      ]    - Considering these product terms proportional to side squares, a right triangle condition (due to the converse of Ptolemy’s theorem) establishes ABC as a right triangle, completing one part of the proof. 6. **Conversely, starting with a right triangle**:    - If triangle ABC is a right triangle (assuming angle ABC = 90^circ):      - Vertices A, B, C will naturally be concyclic, and the common point of omega_a and omega_b will inherently lie on Omega.      - Verifying ratios, we will conclude that X indeed is the tangency point of omega_a and omega_b, ensuring these circles touch. # Conclusion [ boxed{ABC text{ is right-angled if and only if } omega_a text{ and } omega_b text{ are tangent.}} ]"},{"instruction":"The proposed postage rates for mailing a letter are 35 cents for the first ounce and 25 cents for each additional ounce (or fraction of an ounce).

Assume the base of this pyramid is a polygon with 1975 sides. Therefore, the entire polyhedron has 1976 faces (1975 triangular faces formed by the base plus one more face at the apex). 3. **Projecting Vectors:**    Place an arrow at each end of the edges of this pyramid. When projecting these vectors onto a line perpendicular to the base of the pyramid, note the following:        - The projection of vectors along the edges of the base (1975-gon) onto this perpendicular line is zero. This is because all these edges lie in the plane of the base, which is orthogonal to the line of projection.        - The projection of vectors along the edges connecting the apex to the base (side edges of the pyramid) will be either ( +v ) or ( -v ), where ( v ) is a fixed vector in the direction along the perpendicular line. 4. **Sum of Vector Projections:**    There are 1975 side edges in the pyramid:    - Each of these vectors' projections on the perpendicular line can be ( +v ) or ( -v ).    - For the sum of these projections to be zero, the number of ( +v ) vectors and the number of ( -v ) vectors must be equal. 5. **Analyzing Parity:**    However, since 1975 is an odd number, it is impossible to evenly split 1975 into an equal number of ( +v ) and ( -v ) projections. Therefore, the sum of an odd number of ( pm v ) vectors will never be zero. 6. **Conclusion:**    Since it is impossible for all 1975 projections to cancel out to zero, the sum of vectors in this arrangement will always be non-zero.

The largest two-digit number divisible by 9 is 9 * 11 = 99 (since 9 * 12 = 108 is a three-digit number).

Calculate the dot product of vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}:    overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = (m-2) cdot 3 + (m+3) cdot 2 = 3m - 6 + 2m + 6 = 5m 2. Set the dot product to be less than zero (since we want the angle to be obtuse):    5m < 0 3. Solve the inequality 5m < 0 for m:    m < 0 4. Ensure that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are not collinear in the opposite direction:    3(m+3) - 2(m-2) neq 0    3m + 9 - 2m + 4 neq 0    m + 13 neq 0    m neq -13 5.

There are two common methods to solve such problems: one is by using simultaneous equations and Vieta's formulas, and the other is the point-slope method. The first method is more basic but involves more calculations, while the second method requires less computation but sometimes needs some tricks. **Solution** Let the endpoints of the chord be A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}). Then, we have x_{1}+x_{2}=6 and y_{1}+y_{2}=4. Substituting the coordinates of A and B into the equation of the ellipse gives 4x_{1}^{2}+9y_{1}^{2}=144 and 4x_{2}^{2}+9y_{2}^{2}=144. Subtracting these two equations yields 4(x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2})+9(y_{1}^{2}-y_{2}^{2})=0, which simplifies to 4(x_{1}+x_{2})(x_{1}-x_{2})+9(y_{1}+y_{2})(y_{1}-y_{2})=0.

How many Hydrogen atoms are in the compound?","output":"To find the number of Hydrogen atoms in the compound, we need to calculate the total mass contributed by the Carbon and Oxygen atoms and then subtract that from the total molecular weight of the compound to find the mass contributed by the Hydrogen atoms. The atomic weight of Carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 amu (atomic mass units), and the atomic weight of Oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 amu. The atomic weight of Hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 amu. Since the compound has 2 Carbon atoms and 2 Oxygen atoms, we can calculate their total mass as follows: Total mass of Carbon atoms = 2 * 12.01 amu = 24.02 amu Total mass of Oxygen atoms = 2 * 16.00 amu = 32.00 amu Now, we add the mass of Carbon and Oxygen atoms together: Total mass of C and O atoms = 24.02 amu + 32.00 amu = 56.02 amu The molecular weight of the compound is given as 60 amu. To find the mass contributed by the Hydrogen atoms, we subtract the total mass of C and O atoms from the molecular weight: Mass of Hydrogen atoms = Molecular weight - Total mass of C and O atoms Mass of Hydrogen atoms = 60 amu - 56.02 amu = 3.98 amu Now, we divide the mass of Hydrogen atoms by the atomic weight of a single Hydrogen atom to find the number of Hydrogen atoms: Number of Hydrogen atoms = Mass of Hydrogen atoms / Atomic weight of Hydrogen Number of Hydrogen atoms = 3.98 amu / 1.008 amu ≈ 3.95 Since the number of atoms must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number.

Thus, each original edge contributes two new edges, leading to 2 times 120 = 240 edge additions. 2. **Additional Edges from Planar Interconnections:**    Each plane P_k adds 2 edges for every edge originally emitting from V_k. If we assume each vertex is approximately similar in connectivity, we can estimate each vertex connects to about 240 / n of these initial 240 new segments. Since each plane adds 2 edges per original edge emanating from V_k, 2 times 240 / n edges are added per plane, totaling 2 times 240 = 480. 3. **Total Edge Count:**    Starting with 120 initial edges and with both new segment additions and plane-inserted edges:    - Original and split edges: 120 + 240 = 360    - Additional edges from new planar connections: 480    - Total edges = 360 + 480 = 840.

We consider a prime p_1 which divides both n and divides at higher power d_1 compared to d_2.  5. **Analyzing the Influence of the Selected Prime**:    Since p_{1}^{c_{1}} < p_{1}^{a_{1}}, the term p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{1}^{c_{1}} = p_{1}^{a_{1}+c_{1}} is a common divisor of n, d_1 and d_2, hence it will be a divisor of (n, d_1 + d_2). This reflects the influence of the prime factors in the formation of the GCD of the sum. 6. **Considering Different Primes**:    Similarly, analyze other prime factors p_2, q_1, q_2, ldots along with p_1 in both (n, d_1) and (n, d_2). Each prime, through similar steps, shows how combined product for the common divisor will translate in our inequality. 7. **Combination of Results**:    Considering the previous combination arguments for all prime factors p_1, p_2, ldots, we recognize that the product left(n, d_{1}right) left(n, d_{2}right) divides n(n, d_1 + d_2) – thanks to the resolution by prime factors and their power summation properties. Therefore:        n(n, d_{1} + d_{2}) geq (n, d_{1})(n, d_{2})        implies        left(n, d_{1} + d_{2}right) geq frac{(n, d_{1})(n, d_{2})}{n}     8. **Conclusion**:    Hence,        frac{(n, d_{1} + d_{2})}{(n, d_{1})(n, d_{2})} geq frac{1}{n}        This proves the needed inequality.    blacksquare"},{"instruction":"On the sides BC, CA, and AB of triangle ABC, points A_1, B_1, and C_1 are taken respectively.

Now, let's look at the sums of the constants ( {0, 1, 4, 9, 16} ) taking only 3 elements at a time:    [    0 + 1 + 4 = 5    ]    [    0 + 1 + 9 = 10    ]    [    0 + 1 + 16 = 17    ]    [    0 + 4 + 9 = 13    ]    [    0 + 4 + 16 = 20    ]    [    0 + 9 + 16 = 25    ]    [    1 + 4 + 9 = 14    ]    [    1 + 4 + 16 = 21    ]    [    1 + 9 + 16 = 26    ]    [    4 + 9 + 16 = 29    ] 9. We clearly see that only ( (n+1)^2, (n+2)^2, (n+4)^2 ) satisfy the condition to be on the same side with ( (n+7)^2 ). So we have:    [    (n+1)^2 + (n+2)^2 + (n+4)^2 + (n+7)^2 = n^2 + (n+3)^2 + (n+5)^2 + (n+6)^2 = 4n^2 + 28n + 70    ] 10. Now we can clearly see that the numbers ( n+1, n+2, n+4, n+7 ) have to be in one set and the numbers ( n, n+3, n+5, n+6 ) in the other one. Now we have:     [     (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+7) = 4n + 14 = n + (n+3) + (n+5) + (n+6)     ] Thus, the sum of elements of set ( A ) is equal to the sum of elements of set ( B ).

To verify, since the hypotenuse (c = 6), we consider (a = 0.6x) and (b = 0.8x) where (x) is a scaling factor such that (0.6x = 3k) and (0.8x = 4k). Calculating (k), the scaling factor, from (3k + 4k = 6), yields (k = 1). So we have (a = 1.8) and (b = 2.4), forming a triangle with legs (1.8, 2.4) scaled from (3, 4). Checking the area of the smaller triangle with these leg lengths: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 1.8 times 2.4 = 2.16 ] This contradicts the given area of 10 square inches. To keep the simpler familiar structure, consider it might not be a scale of the 3-4-5 triangle but one that fits the hypotenuse and area directly, we revise: [ frac{1}{2}a b = 10, quad a^2+b^2 = 36 ] From (ab=20), we have (a = frac{20}{b}). Plugging into the second equation: [ left(frac{20}{b}right)^2 + b^2 = 36  frac{400}{b^2} + b^2 = 36 ] Multiplying through by (b^2) and rearranging: [ b^4 - 36b^2 + 400 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula in (b^2): [ b^2 = frac{36 pm sqrt{1296 - 1600}}{2} = 18 pm 12 ] Thus, (b^2 = 30) or (6), and (b = sqrt{30}) or (sqrt{6}). Given a right triangle, these choices suggest the triangles, but for simplicity, we'll say (b) and (a) are such that the original condition holds, and the correct scenario corresponds to (a = 10/sqrt{30}). Now, the larger triangle has sides scaled by ( sqrt{frac{360}{10}} = 6 ). So, the sides of the larger triangle are (b = 6sqrt{30}) and (a = 60/sqrt{30} = 10sqrt{30}).

This can be shown using a chessboard coloring argument, where the wren will always land on squares of the same color, making it impossible to reach ((1,0)) which is of a different color. 3. **Assuming ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ) and ( m ) is even, ( n ) is odd:**    - We classify the moves into two types:      - Type 1: ((x, y) to (x pm m, y pm n))      - Type 2: ((x, y) to (x pm n, y pm m))    - Since the order of moves does not matter, we can assume all type 1 moves are done first, followed by type 2 moves. 4. **Using Type 1 Moves:**    - We can move from ((x, y)) to ((x pm am, y pm bn)) if and only if ( a equiv b pmod{2} ).    - The number of type 1 moves required is (max{|a|, |b|}). 5. **Using Type 2 Moves:**    - Similarly, we can move from ((x, y)) to ((x pm cn, y pm dm)) if and only if ( c equiv d pmod{2} ).    - The number of type 2 moves required is (max{|c|, |d|}). 6. **Combining Moves to Reach ((1,0)):**    - We want to achieve the following sequence of moves:      [      (0,0) xrightarrow[text{type 1 only}]{(am, bn)} xrightarrow[text{type 2 only}]{(am+cn, bn+dm)} = (1,0)      ]    - Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), ( m mid b ) and ( n mid d ), so ( b ) must be even.

Pairs of divisors:    Suppose (n) has (k) divisors. These divisors can be paired as ((d, n/d)) because for every divisor (d) of (n), (n/d) is also a divisor of (n). Thus, these divisors typically come in pairs. 3. Considering the case of an odd number of divisors:    If (n) has an odd number of divisors, then one of these divisors must not be paired (since an odd number cannot be evenly divided into pairs). 4.

Assume the conclusion is not true. Specifically, assume that for every problem ( h ) where ( 1 leq h leq 10 ), if we remove ( h ), then there must exist at least one pair of students ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) who have exactly the same set of correct answers for the remaining problems.      2. **Graph Construction**:    Represent each student as a point (vertex) in a graph ( G ). Draw an edge between two vertices ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) if these two students have exactly the same answers except for the problem ( h ) that was removed. Label the edge with the number ( h ). 3. **Graph Properties**:    Thus, we construct a graph ( G ) with 10 vertices (representing the 10 problems) and 10 edges, each labeled uniquely from 1 to 10. 4. **Graph Connectivity and Cycles**:    This graph ( G ) consists of several connected components (if ( G ) is fully connected, this counts as one connected component). Since the number of vertices ( V ) is less than or equal to the number of edges ( E ) in ( G ) (( V leq E )), there exists at least one connected component of ( G ) with a number of vertices ( V leq E ). Therefore, ( G ) must contain a cycle. 5. **Cycle Analysis**:    Let ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k ) be vertices that form a cycle in ( G ). As we traverse this cycle, each time we cross an edge ( v_i v_{i+1} ), this corresponds to either adding or removing a problem labeled by that edge to the problem set. Assume the initial set of problems that ( v_i ) answered correctly is ( M(v_i) ). By the end of the cycle, ( M(v_{k+1}) = M(v_1) ) should still hold, which implies ( M(v_{k+1}) ) ending up being exactly the same as ( M(v_1) ). Here, ( v_{k+1} = v_1 ). 6. **Contradiction in Labels**:    However, since each edge label represents a unique problem, and the numbers added/removed are different, we face a contradiction. The set ( M(v_1) ) cannot remain unchanged as each vertex's set after crossing all these edges should reflect this unique addition or removal of problems. 7. **Conclusion**:    Thus, we reach a contradiction, establishing that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, we conclude that there must exist at least one problem ( h ) such that after removing ( h ), any two students still have different sets of correct problems.

From factorial properties, this is generally not true for larger ( n ), specifically when ( n ) is prime or barely composite since ( n^3 ) grows faster than ( n! ) accumulates multiples of ( n ). 5. **Prime Number Impact**: For larger values of ( n ) particularly primes, this divisibility becomes rarer. Counting the primes up to 60 (there are 17 primes up to 60), we can roughly estimate times ( n ) is not prime but rather some power or product leading to non-integer results for this factorial division. 6. **Estimation**: With primes and non-prime exceptions such as small powers, the numbers for which the expression is not an integer may increase. Estimating the non-integer outcomes as approximately 20 considering small values and primes, the integer results are about ( 60 - 20 = 40 ). **Conclusion**: The number of integers ( n ) for which ( frac{(n^3-1)!}{(n!)^n} ) is an integer is approximately 40. boxed{The correct answer is C) 40.}"},{"instruction":"A projection takes begin{pmatrix} 3  3 end{pmatrix} to begin{pmatrix} frac{75}{26}  frac{15}{26} end{pmatrix}.

The left-hand side of the inequality, specifically the third term, cos left[(2 x + 1) sqrt{x^{4} - 5 x^{2} + 4}right], is defined for real x only if         0 leq x^{4} - 5 x^{2} + 4 = (x^{2} - 4)(x^{2} - 1) = (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1).     3. The above condition is satisfied for ( x ) in the ranges ( |x| leq 1 ) or ( |x| geq 2 ). Therefore, the given inequality is meaningful for these ranges of ( x ). If ( 1 < |x| < 2 ), the expression under the square root becomes negative and undefined in the real numbers. 4. We need to show that the inequality holds for ( |x| leq 1 ) and ( |x| geq 2 ).

The team with the highest score would be crowned the champion. It is known that there is a team with the highest score (higher than all other teams), but this team has fewer wins than the other teams. The minimum number of teams participating in the match is ______.","output":"To solve this problem, we start by denoting the team with the highest score as team A. Suppose team A has won n matches and drawn m matches. This means the total score of team A is calculated by the formula 2n + m. Given that team A has fewer wins than any other team, we can infer that every other team has won at least n+1 matches. This implies that the minimum score for any other team is 2(n+1) points because winning a match grants 2 points. To ensure that team A has the highest score despite having fewer wins, we set up the inequality 2n + m > 2(n+1). Simplifying this inequality gives us m > 2, which means team A must have drawn at least 3 matches to maintain the highest score. However, if team A draws with another team, say team B, then team B's score would be at least 2(n+1) + 1. This leads to the inequality 2n + m > 2(n+1) + 1, simplifying to m > 3. Therefore, team A must have drawn at least 4 matches. If we consider 5 teams participating, team A's total score from 4 draws would be 4 points. Since the other 4 teams would each have to win at least 1 match to surpass team A's number of wins, it's inevitable that at least one of these teams would also have a score of at least 4 points, contradicting the premise that team A has the highest score. Now, let's consider the scenario with 6 teams. If team A draws 4 matches (earning 4 points) and the distribution of wins among the other teams is such that they all win at least one match but not enough to surpass team A's score significantly, we can construct a scenario where team A remains the highest scorer. For instance, if the scores are distributed as shown in the table below, where team A draws with every other team and the rest of the matches are distributed to ensure no team exceeds team A's score significantly: |       | Team A | Team B | Team C | Team D | Team E | Team F | Score | |-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------| | Team A|        |   1    |   1    |   1    |   1    |   0    |   6   | | Team B|   1    |        |   2    |   0    |   0    |   2    |   5   | | Team C|   1    |   0    |        |   0    |   2    |   2    |   5   | | Team D|   1    |   2    |   2    |        |   0    |   0    |   5   | | Team E|   1    |   0    |   0    |   2    |        |   2    |   5   | | Team F|   0    |   0    |   0    |   2    |   2    |        |   4   | This table illustrates a scenario where team A has the highest score with fewer wins, satisfying all given conditions.

This means that (alpha) is a root of both (P) and its derivative (P'), hence:    [    P(alpha) = 0 quad text{and} quad P'(alpha) = 0    ]  3. **Expression for the Derivative:**    The derivative of (P(X)) is given by:    [    P'(X) = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{X^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} frac{X^k}{k!}    ]    Note that (P'(X)) looks similar to (P(X)) but is missing the last term of (P(X)), which is (frac{X^n}{n!}).  4. **Relate (P) and (P'):**    Notice that:    [    P(X) = P'(X) + frac{X^n}{n!}    ]    This is a crucial observation that will help in deriving a contradiction.  5. **Evaluate at ( alpha ):**    Since we suppose that ( alpha ) is a multiple root, we substitute (alpha) into the above relationship:    [    P(alpha) = P'(alpha) + frac{alpha^n}{n!}    ]    Given that (P(alpha) = 0) and (P'(alpha) = 0), we have:    [    0 = 0 + frac{alpha^n}{n!} implies frac{alpha^n}{n!} = 0 implies alpha^n = 0 implies alpha = 0    ]  6. **Contradiction:**    We assumed ( alpha ) is a root of ( P(X) ), which implies ( P(0) = 0 ). However, we can verify that:    [    P(0) = sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{0^k}{k!} = 1 neq 0    ]    Hence, (alpha = 0) cannot be a root of ( P(X) ).  7. **Conclusion:**    We have reached a contradiction by assuming that ( P(X) ) has a multiple root.

This can be written as: (S + (P/100) * S) * (1 - 10/100) Simplifying the above expression: (S + (P/100) * S) * (90/100) Now, we know that the net change in the worker's salary is 1%, so the final salary is S + 1% of S, which can be written as: S + (1/100) * S Equating the two expressions for the final salary, we get: (S + (P/100) * S) * (90/100) = S + (1/100) * S Expanding both sides: (90/100) * S + (90/100) * (P/100) * S = S + (1/100) * S Now, we can divide both sides by S to simplify: (90/100) + (90/100) * (P/100) = 1 + (1/100) Simplifying further: 0.9 + 0.9 * (P/100) = 1.01 Now, we solve for P: 0.9 * (P/100) = 1.01 - 0.9 0.9 * (P/100) = 0.11 Dividing both sides by 0.9: (P/100) = 0.11 / 0.9 P/100 = 0.1222...

The rest of the faces of the polyhedron are colored in white.\\r \\r Prove that the number of common sides of two whitecolored faces of the polyhedron is at least  n2 .","output":"1. **Understanding the problem and Euler's formula**:    We are given a polyhedron with ( n ) faces, some of which are colored black such that no two black faces share a common vertex. The rest of the faces are colored white. We need to prove that the number of common sides of two white-colored faces is at least ( n-2 ).    Euler's formula for polyhedra states:    [    V - E + F = 2    ]    where ( V ) is the number of vertices, ( E ) is the number of edges, and ( F ) is the number of faces of the polyhedron. 2. **Defining variables**:    Let:    - ( V_b ) be the number of vertices that belong to black faces.    - ( V_w = V - V_b ) be the number of vertices that belong to white faces.    - ( E_b ) be the number of edges that belong to black faces.    - ( E_w = E - E_b ) be the number of edges that belong to white faces. 3. **Analyzing black faces**:    Since no two black faces share a common vertex, each black face is isolated in terms of vertices and edges. This implies that each vertex and edge of a black face is unique to that face. 4. **Relating vertices and edges of black faces**:    For a black face with ( k ) vertices, it also has ( k ) edges. Therefore, the total number of vertices and edges for all black faces are equal:    [    V_b = E_b    ] 5. **Applying Euler's formula to white faces**:    The white faces form a subgraph of the polyhedron. We need to consider the Euler characteristic for the white faces. The number of vertices and edges in the white subgraph are ( V_w ) and ( E_w ), respectively. 6. **Using Euler's formula for the white subgraph**:    The white subgraph must also satisfy Euler's formula:    [    V_w - E_w + F_w = 2    ]    where ( F_w ) is the number of white faces. Since ( F_w = n - text{number of black faces} ), we denote it as ( F_w = n - k ) where ( k ) is the number of black faces. 7. **Bounding the number of common sides of white faces**:    The number of common sides of two white faces is given by the number of edges in the white subgraph minus the number of edges that are shared by white faces. Since each edge in the white subgraph can be shared by at most two white faces, we need to find a lower bound for ( E_w ). 8. **Combining the equations**:    From Euler's formula for the entire polyhedron:    [    V - E + F = 2    ]    and substituting ( V = V_b + V_w ) and ( E = E_b + E_w ), we get:    [    (V_b + V_w) - (E_b + E_w) + n = 2    ]    Since ( V_b = E_b ), this simplifies to:    [    V_w - E_w + n = 2    ]    Rearranging, we get:    [    E_w = V_w + n - 2    ] 9. **Conclusion**:    Since ( E_w ) represents the number of edges in the white subgraph, and each edge can be shared by at most two white faces, the number of common sides of two white faces is at least ( n - 2 ).

If ( p(x_1) = p(x_2) ), then substituting into ( P ) gives ( P(p(x_1)) = P(p(x_2)) ). Since ( P(p(x)) = x ), this equality implies ( x_1 = x_2 ). Therefore, ( p ) cannot be a constant or a quadratic polynomial (as they are not one-to-one functions over all reals). 2. **Determination of Polynomial Degree:**     Given the one-to-one nature, this implies ( p(x) ) must be a linear polynomial. Let ( p(x) = b x + c ), where ( b neq 0 ). 3. **Express ( P(x) ):**     Assume ( P(x) ) to be a linear function of the form ( P(x) = frac{1}{b} x - frac{c}{b} ). 4. **Verify the Initial Condition:**     Substitute ( p(x) = bx + c ) into ( P(x)):     [     P(p(x)) = P(bx + c) = frac{1}{b} (bx + c) - frac{c}{b} = x + frac{c}{b} - frac{c}{b} = x     ]     This confirms that ( P(p(x)) = x ). 5. **Working on Verification of ( p(P(x)) ):**     We want to find ( p(P(x)) ).

The remaining cosine term beyond (6479^circ) is:    [    cos 6480^circ = cos (360^circ times 18) = cos 0^circ = 1    ] 4. For the sine function, we use a similar property:    [    sin alpha + sin (alpha + 180^circ) = 0    ]    And the sequence of sines:    [    sin alpha + sin (alpha + 1^circ) + cdots + sin (alpha + 179^circ) = 0    ]    Thus:    [    sin 2903^circ + sin 2904^circ + cdots + sin 6502^circ = 0    ] 5. The remaining sine term beyond (6502^circ) is:    [    sin 6503^circ = sin (6503^circ - 6480^circ) = sin 23^circ    ] 6.

We can calculate this ratio as follows: Ratio of train to bus = Distance traveled by train / Distance traveled by bus Ratio of train to bus = 240 km / 360 km To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 120 km in this case: Ratio of train to bus = (240 km / 120 km) / (360 km / 120 km) Ratio of train to bus = 2 / 3 So, the ratio of the distance traveled by train to the distance traveled by bus is boxed{2:3} ."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, a, b, and c are the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C respectively.

From point D, we draw lines parallel to the sides AC and AB. Let's see where these lines intersect the other sides. 1.

Draw line DF parallel to AB such that it intersects AC at point F.        - Since DF parallel AB, triangle ADF is similar to triangle ADB by the AA criterion.      3.

Next, compute the perimeter of quadrilateral AEDF:         - Perimeter of AEDF = AE + ED + DF + FA.         - Since DE = EB (from the property of the isosceles triangle triangle EBD), we replace ED with EB.         - Since DF = FC (from the property of the isosceles triangle triangle FDC), we replace DF with FC.          - Hence, the perimeter of AEDF becomes:    [    AE + ED + DF + FA = AE + EB + FC + FA    ] 5.

Let's count the parts step by step: 1. Add the first plane; we have 2 parts. 2. Add the second plane parallel to the first one; it divides each of the previous parts in two, resulting in 2 times 2 = 4 parts. 3. Add the third plane parallel to the first and second ones; similarly, it divides each of the four parts into two: 4 times 2 = 8 parts. This counts for the divisions made by the planes parallel to one face of the cube. Now, consider the planes parallel to another face of the cube: 4. Add the fourth plane (which is parallel to a different face of the cube), it interacts with the previous 8 parts. Each plane intersection divides the parts into two along a new axis, which results in 8 times 2 = 16 parts. 5. Add the fifth plane (also parallel to that second face of the cube); similar to earlier steps, it doubles the number of parts to 16 times 2 = 32 parts. 6. However, we must consider that the sixth plane added does not double the previous count because it lies on the exterior, just like the first plane of each pair. Therefore, this sixth plane will intersect all three previously placed planes creating new regions. It will slice each of the 16 parts in half, resulting in 16 times 2 = 32 parts. But we must subtract the intersections that don't create new parts because they occur on the edge of the cube's faces. At each edge where two planes meet, there is no new division (and there are 12 edges), and at each corner where three planes meet (and there are 8 corners), we must add back the previously subtracted intersection. The correction to count is then 32 - 12 + 8 = 28. Following this corrected counting, we must subtract one more because the final placement of the last plane (parallel to the third face of the cube) doesn't create a new part on the far side (similar to how the first plane doesn't create a new part) - hence we subtract one additional part. 7.

We are told that for any real number m, the inequality a(y_{0}-n)leqslant 0 holds. Let's analyze this step by step: 1. **Understanding the Inequality**: The inequality a(y_{0}-n)leqslant 0 implies that the difference in the y-values between the fixed point (x_{0}, y_{0}) and any other point (m,n) on the graph does not change sign regardless of the value of m. This suggests that (x_{0}, y_{0}) is a special point on the graph. 2. **Identifying the Special Point**: Since (x_{0}, y_{0}) maintains a consistent relationship with all other points (m,n) on the graph in terms of the y-values, and considering the nature of quadratic functions, we deduce that (x_{0}, y_{0}) must be the vertex of the quadratic function. The vertex of a quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+c is given by the formula x_{0}=-frac{b}{2a}. 3. **Substituting the Vertex into the Equation**: Knowing that (x_{0}, y_{0}) is the vertex and x_{0}=-frac{b}{2a}, we can substitute x_{0} back into a form that matches one of the given options.

If the units digit of n is 9, then adding 1 results in carrying. Therefore, the units digit of n must be from 0 to 8 (9 possible values). 2. **Tens digit:** To avoid carrying from the units to the tens, the tens digit of n can freely range from 0 to 9 as long as the units digit is not 9.

For simplicity, denote this semicircle as k. 2. **Identify Intersection Points:**    Extend the ray AD such that it intersects the semicircle k at points D_1 and D_2. 3. **Construct Parallels:**    Draw lines through D_1 and D_2 parallel to BC. Let these lines intersect the rays AB and AC at the points B_i and C_i respectively, where (i = 1, 2). 4. **Verify Construction:**    Since D_1 and D_2 lie on the Thales circle, angle D_1BC = 90^circ and angle D_2BC = 90^circ. Therefore, the angles subtended by the segments B_1C_1 and B_2C_2 from D are both right angles. 5. **Check the Number of Solutions:**    We have silently assumed that both D_1 and D_2 exist and are distinct from D. If there is only one point different from A and D, we get only one solution. Generally, the number of solutions corresponds to the number of intersection points of ray AD with circle k that are different from A and D. 6. **Analysis of Special Cases:**    If D is an internal point on BC, there will always be an intersection point on the side of BC opposite to A. An intersection point exists on the side containing A if and only if angle BAC < 90^circ.         If D coincides with B, there will be only one intersection point different from A.

This involves considering each type of ball that could be transferred from bag A to bag B and its impact on the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B. Let's break it down step by step: 1. **If a red ball is transferred from bag A to bag B:** - The probability of drawing a red ball from bag A, A_1, is frac{2}{5} since there are 2 red balls out of 5 total balls in bag A. - After transferring a red ball to bag B, bag B will have 4 red balls out of 6 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{4}{6}. Combining these probabilities, we get: frac{2}{5} times frac{4}{6}. 2. **If a white ball is transferred from bag A to bag B:** - The probability of drawing a white ball from bag A, A_2, is frac{2}{5} since there are 2 white balls out of 5 total balls in bag A. - After transferring a white ball to bag B, bag B will still have 3 red balls, but now out of 6 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{3}{6}. Combining these probabilities, we get: frac{2}{5} times frac{3}{6}. 3. **If a black ball is transferred from bag A to bag B:** - The probability of drawing a black ball from bag A, A_3, is frac{1}{5} since there is 1 black ball out of 5 total balls in bag A. - After transferring a black ball to bag B, bag B will still have 3 red balls, but now out of 6 total balls. So, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B in this scenario is frac{3}{6}. Combining these probabilities, we get: frac{1}{5} times frac{3}{6}. Adding all these probabilities together to find the total probability of drawing a red ball from bag B, we have: [P(B) = frac{2}{5} times frac{4}{6} + frac{2}{5} times frac{3}{6} + frac{1}{5} times frac{3}{6} = frac{8}{30} + frac{6}{30} + frac{3}{30} = frac{17}{30}] Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball from bag B after transferring a ball from bag A is boxed{frac{17}{30}}.

Additionally, we know that at least one of them occurs in every experiment. Similarly, events A and C are also mutually exclusive. Given these conditions, we can proceed as follows: 1. Since A and B are mutually exclusive and at least one of them occurs, we can express the probability of A happening in terms of B's probability. Since the total probability of all possible outcomes in an experiment is 1, and given that P(B) = 0.6, we can find P(A) as: [ P(A) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 ] 2. Knowing that A and C cannot occur simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive), and given P(C) = 0.2, to find P(A cup C), which is the probability of either A or C occurring, we simply add their probabilities because they are mutually exclusive. Therefore: [ P(A cup C) = P(A) + P(C) = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 ] Thus, the probability of either A or C occurring in a single experiment is 0.6. Therefore, the correct answer is encapsulated as boxed{A}. **Explanation:** We derived P(A) by subtracting P(B) from 1 due to their mutual exclusivity and the condition that at least one of them occurs. Then, we found P(A cup C) by adding P(A) and P(C) since A and C are also mutually exclusive. **Review:** This solution demonstrates the application of fundamental probability concepts such as complementary events and the addition rule for mutually exclusive events.

The base case is trivial and holds true. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the statements are true for all ( n ) such that ( 0 leq n leq 2k ):    - ( f_{2k}(x) ) has no real roots.    - ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) has exactly one real root. 3. **Inductive Step (Step from ( 2k ) to ( 2k+2 ))**: We will first prove that ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) has exactly one real root:    - The polynomial ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) has an odd degree ((2k+1)), which implies that ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) has at least one real root due to the Intermediate Value Theorem.    - From the problem 28.18, we know that the polynomial ( f_n(x) ) does not have multiple roots.    - If there were more than one real root of ( f_{2k+1}(x) ), then between any two real roots there must be a root of its derivative ( f_{2k+1}'(x) = f_{2k}(x) ). But by the inductive hypothesis, ( f_{2k}(x) ) has no real roots. Therefore, ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) can only have one real root. 4. **Next, prove ( f_{2k+2}(x) ) does not have real roots**:    - Suppose ( f_{2k+2}(x) ) has exactly two real roots, ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Then, by Rolle's Theorem, there is at least one point ( x_0 ) between ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) such that ( f_{2k+2}'(x_0) = f_{2k+1}(x_0) = 0 ).    - From our inductive step, we know ( f_{2k+1}(x) ) has exactly one real root. Let that root be ( x_r ). If ( f_{2k+1}(x_0) = 0 ), then ( x_0 = x_r ).    - Evaluate ( f_{2k+2} ) at ( x_r ):      [ f_{2k+2}(x_r) = f_{2k+1}(x_r) + frac{x_r^{2k+2}}{(2k+2)!} = frac{x_r^{2k+2}}{(2k+2)!} geq 0 ]    - Since ( x_r ) is the minimum point for ( f_{2k+2}(x) ) and ( f_{2k+2}(x_r) geq 0 ), ( f_{2k+2}(x) geq 0 ) for all ( x ). This implies ( f_{2k+2}(x) ) cannot have exactly two real roots.    Therefore, there is no contradiction with the above assumption.

A token is balanced if the number of white tokens on its left plus the number of black tokens on its right is ( n ). 2. **Counting Balanced Tokens in Initial Configuration**:    - For the first ( n+1 ) black tokens, there are no white tokens on their left. Therefore, none of these tokens can be balanced because the number of white tokens on their left is zero, which is less than ( n ).    - For the last ( n ) white tokens, there are ( n+1 ) black tokens on their left.

Hence, none of these white tokens can be balanced either.    - The only token that can be balanced is the token at position ( n+1 ) (the last black token in the initial configuration). For this token, the number of white tokens on its left is ( n ) and the number of black tokens on its right is zero:      [      n + 0 = n      ]      Therefore, this token is balanced. 3. **Parity Invariance Under Token Swaps**:    - Consider the operation of swapping a black token ( B ) with a white token ( W ) such that ( cdots BW cdots rightarrow cdots WB cdots ).    - We need to analyze how this swap affects the balanced status of the tokens:      - If ( B ) was balanced before the swap, then ( W ) will be balanced after the swap, and vice versa.      - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were balanced before the swap, they will both become unbalanced after the swap.      - If both ( B ) and ( W ) were unbalanced before the swap, they will either both remain unbalanced or both become balanced after the swap.    - Therefore, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of balanced tokens remains unchanged under any such swap. 4. **Conclusion**:    - Since the initial configuration has exactly one balanced token (which is odd), and the parity of the number of balanced tokens remains invariant under any sequence of swaps, the number of balanced tokens in any configuration must always be odd.

We know the probability ( p ) of being a twin is given by:    [    frac{M}{M + N} approx p    ] 3.

To solve this problem, consider the different potential scenarios involving three children born with some being twins. 4. The required probability ( text{P}(B mid A) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(A)} ), meaning the probability of having twins given that there are three children. 5. Structuring this problem involves recognizing that the probability includes cases with twins but excludes the possibility of triplets since they do not occur. 6. From the graph analysis, the elementary events show that the total probability can be written as:    [    P(A) = 2pq + q^3    ]    where ( 2pq ) represents scenarios with twins and ( q^3 ) for the scenario with all single births. 7. The favorable outcomes for twins are represented by:    [    P(A cap B) = 2pq    ] 8. Therefore, the conditional probability is:    [    text{P}(B mid A) = frac{2pq}{2pq + q^3} = frac{2p}{2p + q^2}    ]        Hence, the probability that there is a pair of twins among three children is:    [    boxed{frac{2p}{2p + q^2}}    ]  Section (c) 1.

Since we have 3 moles of Cl2(g), it will produce 3 moles of NaCl(aq) and 3 moles of NaClO(aq).

We realize that in order for the inequality to have a solution on x in [1, 2], it must be true that ax > 2 - x^2 over that interval. We can rearrange the inequality and express a as a function of x:      a > frac{2}{x} - x.  2. Let's consider the function f(x) = frac{2}{x} - x for x in [1, 2].  3. Calculating the derivative of f(x):      f'(x) = -frac{2}{x^2} - 1 < 0,      which is always negative for x in [1, 2]. This means f(x) is a strictly decreasing function on the interval [1, 2]. 4. As f(x) is strictly decreasing, it attains its maximum at x = 1 and minimum at x = 2. Thus, the range of f(x) on [1, 2] is given by:            [-1, 1].  5.

From these points, we can deduce: - The semi-minor axis b=2 (distance from the center to B). - The focal distance c=2 (distance from the center to F). Using the relationship a^2=b^2+c^2 for ellipses, we find: [a^2=2^2+2^2=8] [a=2sqrt{2}] Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse E is: [frac{x^2}{8}+frac{y^2}{4}=1] Encapsulating the final answer for part (1): [boxed{frac{x^2}{8}+frac{y^2}{4}=1}] **(2)** For the equation of line l that intersects E at points P and Q such that BPFQ forms a parallelogram: - The line l must pass through the midpoint of BF, which is (-1,1). - Assuming the equation of line l is y=k(x+1)+1, we solve the system: [left{begin{array}{l}{y=k(x+1)+1}{frac{x^{2}}{8}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1}end{array}right.] Eliminating y and simplifying gives: [(1+2k^{2})x^{2}+(4k^{2}+4k)x+2k^{2}+4k-6=0] Using Vieta's formulas: [x_1+x_2=-frac{4k^2+4k}{1+2k^2}] [x_1x_2=frac{2k^2+4k-6}{1+2k^2}] Given overrightarrow{BP}=(x_1,y_1-2) and overrightarrow{QF}=(-2-x_2,-y_2), and since BPFQ is a parallelogram, we have overrightarrow{BP}∥overrightarrow{QF}, leading to: [-y_{2}x_{1}+(2+x_{2})(y_{1}-2)=0] Substituting y_{1}=k(x_{1}+1)+1 and y_{2}=k(x_{2}+1)+1 into the equation, we get: [left(k-1right)(x_{1}+x_{2})+2k-2=0] [left(k-1right)(x_{1}+x_{2}+2)=0] Substituting x_1+x_2=-frac{4k^2+4k}{1+2k^2} into the equation gives: [(k-1)(2-frac{4k^2+4k}{1+2k^2})=0] [(k-1)(frac{2-4k}{1+2k^2})=0] Solving for k yields k=frac{1}{2} or k=1. Since the slope of FB is 1, k=1 does not satisfy the conditions, leaving k=frac{1}{2}.

The probability of drawing a yellow ball as the second ball after drawing a yellow ball first would be the number of yellow balls left (2) divided by the total number of balls left (2 + R): P(Second yellow | First yellow) = 2 / (2 + R) We are given that this probability is 0.5: 2 / (2 + R) = 0.5 Now we can solve for R: 2 = 0.5 * (2 + R) 2 = 1 + 0.5R 2 - 1 = 0.5R 1 = 0.5R R = 1 / 0.5 R = 2 So there are boxed{2}  red balls in the bag."},{"instruction":"Suppose that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with  a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{50} = 50 quad text{and} quad a_{51} + a_{52} + cdots + a_{100}=150.

Therefore, the sum of the first 50 terms can be calculated by: a_1 + (a_1+d) + cdots + (a_1+49d) = 50. The sum of terms from an arithmetic sequence is given by: S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d), where ( n ) is the number of terms. Thus, the sum of the first 50 terms is: frac{50}{2}(2a_1 + 49d) = 25(2a_1 + 49d) = 50. Solving for ( 2a_1 + 49d ), we get: 2a_1 + 49d = 2.

The flagpole and its shadow form a right-angled triangle, and the building and its shadow will also form a right-angled triangle. Since the conditions are similar for both the flagpole and the building, the ratios of their corresponding sides will be equal. Let's denote the length of the shadow cast by the building as ( S ). For the flagpole, the ratio of its height to the length of its shadow is: [ frac{text{Height of flagpole}}{text{Length of shadow of flagpole}} = frac{18 text{ meters}}{45 text{ meters}} ] For the building, the ratio of its height to the length of its shadow is: [ frac{text{Height of building}}{text{Length of shadow of building}} = frac{20 text{ meters}}{S} ] Since the ratios are equal, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{18}{45} = frac{20}{S} ] Now, we can solve for ( S ) by cross-multiplying: [ 18 cdot S = 20 cdot 45 ] [ S = frac{20 cdot 45}{18} ] [ S = frac{20 cdot 5 cdot 9}{18} ] [ S = frac{20 cdot 5}{2} ] [ S = 10 cdot 5 ] [ S = 50 text{ meters} ] So, the length of the shadow cast by the building is boxed{50}  meters."},{"instruction":"f a in mathbb{R}, then a=1 is a ( ) condition for |a|=1.

We are also given that Petya's mother takes the elevator from the fourth floor to the first floor (which takes (t + 2) seconds) 2 seconds faster than Petya runs down from the fifth floor to the first floor.

For this number to become a perfect square, the last digit must be one of the digits that a perfect square can end in. The possible last digits of perfect squares are (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9).    - Similarly, consider the number (10n + 7). For this number to become a perfect square, the last digit must also be one of (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9). 4. **Modulo 100 Analysis**:    - We need to check if there are any perfect squares of the form (10n + 3) and (10n + 7) modulo 100.    - The only square of the form (7star) modulo 100 is 76, and the only square of the form (3star) modulo 100 is 36.    - Therefore, to win, Alex would need to add a 6 at the end of the number to make it a perfect square. 5. **Contradiction**:    - Suppose both (a = 100n + 36) and (b = 100n + 76) are perfect squares.    - The difference between these two numbers is (b - a = 40).    - We need to check if there are any pairs of perfect squares that differ by 40. The only pairs of perfect squares differing by 40 are ({81, 121}) and ({9, 49}).    - Neither of these pairs fit the form (100n + 36) and (100n + 76), so it is impossible for both to be perfect squares. 6. **Kelvin's Strategy**:    - On his turn, Kelvin can add either a 3 or a 7 to the end of the current number.    - The above claim guarantees that one of these two possible moves will prevent the number from becoming a perfect square.    - Kelvin can repeat this strategy indefinitely, ensuring that Alex never wins.

Therefore, each residue must correspond uniquely to exactly one of the ( x_i )'s. 5. **Residue Classes:** Since each ( x_i ) falls into a different residue class modulo ( m ) and there are exactly ( m ) such residue classes, there is an injective mapping from ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ) to the residues ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** The set ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m ) indeed takes on each value ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, m-1 ) exactly once modulo ( m ), forming a complete residue system modulo ( m ). Thus, we have proven that any ( m ) pairwise non-congruent integers modulo ( m ) form a complete residue system modulo ( m ).

What is the minimum number of rows required in the arena to ensure this can always be achieved?","output":"1. We know that each row in the hockey arena contains 168 seats. 2. A total of 2016 students from different sports schools are invited to the final match, with no more than 45 students from each school. 3. Each school requires that all its students be seated in a single row.  Finding the Least Number of Rows: 4. Suppose there are n rows with 168 seats each. 5. Since no more than 45 students can be from the same school and each school needs to sit all its students together in one row, in the worst-case scenario, each row should have students from at most 3 schools (because 3 times 45 = 135 leq 168 but 4 times 45 = 180 > 168). 6. Let's consider a case with the maximum number of students. Suppose there are 46 schools, each contributing 43 students, except for one school that contributes 34 students. We need to seat them in such a way that no row exceeds 3 groups of 43 students due to the seat limit per row:    - Maximum students per school from 46 schools, each having around 43 students: 46 times 43 + 34    - Simplified, you get:    46 times 43 = 1978    - Total students including the additional single school:    1978 + 34 = 2012 quad (text{approximately close to } 2016, text{with rounding}).     7. Since we have 46 schools, and a row can handle at most 3 groups of 43, the minimum number of rows required is:    [    frac{46}{3} approx 15.33 text{ (since the students should be seated in complete rows)}    ]     So rounding up, we get a minimum of 16 rows required. 8.

A complete set consists of cells (i, j) such that i and j vary over {mn ;|; m in mathbb{Z}}. 3. **Lemma - Color Uniformity in Complete Sets:**    We assert that in every complete set, either all rows or all columns are monochromatic (i.e., they are all the same color). 4. **Proof of the Lemma:**    Assume there exist two cells of different colors in any row of a complete set. Let these cells be a and b. Then we have the following configuration:         [     begin{array}{cccc}     x & S_2 & y &         &    &    &         &    & D  & vdots      a & S_1 & b &       end{array}     ]        Here, a and b belong to some row of our complete set, and x and y are the cells directly above them. Since each n times n square contains all colors, the set of colors in the region (a cup S_1 cup D) and (x cup S_2 cup D) must be equivalent.     - Consider the sets a cup S_1 and x cup S_2. Similarly, the color sets in S_2 cup y and S_1 cup b should match. If S_1 does not contain b's color, the same holds for x cup S_2. However, S_2 cup y clearly contains it, leading to y and b being the same color. Symmetrically, x and a must be the same color. Reiterating this for more cells shows every column contains the same color, or the rows would introduce contradictions. 5. **Identifying the Coloring Pattern:**    Recognize a full set is distinguished into vertical and horizontal categories: If every column is monochromatic within a full set, it's a vertical complete set, and otherwise, it's horizontal. 6. **Construction of Vertical and Horizontal Sets:**    Let's showcase that any horizontal complete set intersects with the special row. Assuming otherwise, consider its nearest row to our special one. If this row’s color is a, encapsulate any cell in the special row with a square incorporating a cell colored a from our horizontal set, contradicting the color presence in the special row. 7. **Uniqueness and Completeness:**    Let's argue by contradiction:     - If horizontal complete sets exist, each intersects the special row, so the special row intersects exactly n horizontal sets, containing only n colors, contradicting the initial assumption all n^2 colors are there.         - Hence, there exists a vertical complete set ensuring columns are periodically colored with n unique colors, and thus, they align with the special row’s color distribution. # Conclusion: boxed{text{There exists a column containing exactly } n text{ colors.}}"},{"instruction":"What is the total area enclosed by the graph of |4x| + |3y| = 12 and the region under the line y = 2x  4 within the bounds of the rhombus on the xaxis?","output":"The graph |4x| + |3y| = 12 forms a rhombus centered at the origin.

Given the structure of the words, consider each term in its expanded form based on place values. Let’s simplify the equation step by step to observe any patterns: 4. Notice that the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation consists of three terms. We need to sum these terms considering their respective place values. 5.

Let's denote the total number of black checkers as ( B = 100 ) and the number of white checkers as ( W ). 2. Each black checker must correspond to a diametrically opposite white checker. Therefore, for each black checker placed on the circle, there should be a corresponding white checker placed exactly opposite it on the circle. This implies that the total number of checkers, ( N = B + W ), must be even.     Since ( B = 100 ), an even number, ( W ) must also be even to keep ( N ) even.  3. Next, let's consider the placement condition: no two white checkers must be adjacent, and each black checker must have a diametrically opposite white checker. 4. Given the circle structure and the diametrically opposite placement, this means that the checkers must alternately be placed in such a manner that black and white checkers alternate with each other.  5. Therefore, let’s analyze alternating arrangements:    - For ( N = 200 ), the only feasible arrangement without violating any of the given constraints is one where the checkers alternate exactly, i.e., black, white, black, white, and so forth.    - Under the alternating setup, each black checker will be opposite to a white checker. 6. Now consider that between any two black checkers, there should be exactly one white checker. This implies that there are 100 pairs of black-white adjacent positions. Since there are ( 100 ) black checkers, there must be precisely ( frac{100}{1} = 100 ) white checkers. 7. However, the problem also states another condition: If black checkers and white checkers are placed alternately, we must check the distribution within any semicircle (half-circle):    - There should be ( frac{100+100}{2} = 100 ) positions in any semicircle.    - Since checkers are alternated fully, there will be ( 50 ) black and ( 50 ) white checkers within each semicircle. 8. But if we place ( 1 ) black checker and there must be ( 1 ) white checker adjacently next to each black checker, it contradict with our condition that no two white checkers should be adjacent next to each other.  9. Hence, it is clear a valid alternative arrangement satisfying all the conditions is impossible since checker placement conditions (positioning diametrically opposite and ensuring non-adjacency of white checkers) impose inherent contradictions. # Conclusion: Putting exactly 100 black and any number of white checkers in a manner where each black checker corresponds to a diametrically opposite white checker and no two white checkers stand beside each other is **impossible**.

The distance formula is ( text{Distance} = text{Speed} times text{Time} ), and we need to convert minutes into hours because the speed is given in kmph. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert the time into hours by dividing by 60. For the man walking at 4 kmph: [ D = 4 times left( frac{T}{60} right) ] When the man walks at 5 kmph, he reaches the station 6 minutes early. So, the time taken by the man to reach the station at 5 kmph is ( T - 12 ) minutes (6 minutes less than the train's time and 6 minutes early). For the man walking at 5 kmph: [ D = 5 times left( frac{T - 12}{60} right) ] Now we have two equations for ( D ): [ 4 times left( frac{T}{60} right) = 5 times left( frac{T - 12}{60} right) ] To solve for ( T ), we can equate the two expressions for ( D ): [ 4T = 5(T - 12) ] Expanding the right side: [ 4T = 5T - 60 ] Subtracting ( 5T ) from both sides: [ -T = -60 ] Dividing by ( -1 ): [ T = 60 ] Now that we have ( T ), we can find ( D ) using either of the two original equations.

Could it be possible that each of these numbers, except one, is equal to the difference of its neighbors?","output":"1. Let us assume that the desired arrangement of 300 positive numbers on a circle exists. Specifically, we assume that each number except one equals the difference of its neighbors. 2. Suppose ( m ) is the greatest number among these 300 positive numbers. Clearly, ( m ) cannot be equal to the difference of its two neighbors since ( m ) is the greatest and the difference cannot exceed ( m ). Hence, only one number, ( m ), does not equal the difference of its neighbors. 3. Let ( d ) be one of the smallest numbers among these 300 numbers. Consider one of the arcs on the circle between ( d ) and ( m ); let the positions on this arc be these consecutive numbers: ( d = a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k = m ). 4. We need to prove by induction on ( i = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ) that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ).     - **Base case** (( i = 0 )): The assertion ( a_1 geq a_0 ) is true as ( d ) is the smallest number.     - **Inductive step**: Suppose that for some ( i < k ), ( a_{i-1} leq a_i ). We have the equation ( a_i = |a_{i-1} - a_{i+1}| ). Given ( a_{i+1} > 0 ) and assuming the correct induction step, it leads to ( a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ). Thus, ( a_{i+1} > a_i ) which completes the inductive step. 5. This implies that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ) for all ( i ). 6. We have established that these numbers increase monotonously from ( d = a_0 ) to ( m = a_k ) on one arc. Similarly, consider the other arc between ( d ) and ( m ); if these numbers are ( d = b_0, b_1, ldots, b_ell = m ), a similar argument shows ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ) for all ( i ). 7. Since ( a_0 = b_0 = d ), we must also have ( d = |a_1 - b_1| ). Assuming without loss of generality ( d = b_1 - a_1 ), we get ( a_2 = a_1 + a_0 ) and consequently, ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 8. The sequences ( a_0, a_1, ldots ) and ( b_0, b_1, ldots ) satisfy ( a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ), along with ( b_{i+2} = b_{i+1} + b_i ). 9. Finally, the number ( a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots ). This implies that ( b_ell = a_k ) only when ( k = ell + 1 ), but in such cases, the total number of numbers in the circle would be ( k + ell = 2ell + 1 ), an odd number, which cannot equal 300. 10.

If the first shirt costs 6 more than the second shirt and the first shirt costs 15, then the second shirt costs 15 - 6 = 9. Now, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts before any discounts or taxes: Total cost = Cost of first shirt + Cost of second shirt Total cost = 15 + 9 Total cost = 24 Next, we apply the discounts to each shirt: Discount on the first shirt = 15% of 15 = 0.15 * 15 = 2.25 Discount on the second shirt = 10% of 9 = 0.10 * 9 = 0.90 Now, let's subtract the discounts from the original prices of the shirts: Cost of the first shirt after discount = 15 - 2.25 = 12.75 Cost of the second shirt after discount = 9 - 0.90 = 8.10 Now, let's calculate the total cost after discounts: Total cost after discounts = Cost of first shirt after discount + Cost of second shirt after discount Total cost after discounts = 12.75 + 8.10 Total cost after discounts = 20.85 Finally, we apply the sales tax to the total cost after discounts: Sales tax = 7% of 20.85 = 0.07 * 20.85 = 1.4595 Since we usually round to the nearest cent, the sales tax would be approximately 1.46.

By using the method to find the domain of a function and combining it with the domain of a logarithmic function, we get sin x > frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Finally, using the trigonometric function line, we arrive at the conclusion. **Solution** To make the function y=ln(2sin x- sqrt{2}) meaningful, we need 2sin x- sqrt{2} > 0, i.e., sin x > frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, thus 2kpi+ frac{pi}{4} < x < 2kpi+ frac{3pi}{4}(kinmathbb{Z}), Therefore, the domain of the function y=ln(2sin x- sqrt{2}) is left(2kpi+ frac{pi}{4},2kpi+ frac{3pi}{4}right)(kinmathbb{Z}).

The inequality f(x) geq 0 must hold for x in [-2, 2]. The corresponding quadratic inequality is x^2 + ax + (3 - a) geq 0. Let's examine the function at the endpoints of the interval and its axis of symmetry x=-frac{a}{2}: 1. At x = -2, the function value is f(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2a + (3 - a) = 4 + 3 - 3a = 7 - 3a. This value must be nonnegative, i.e., 7 - 3a geq 0. 2. At x = 2, the function value is f(2) = 2^2 + 2a + (3 - a) = 4 + 3 + a = 7 + a. This must also be nonnegative, i.e., 7 + a geq 0. 3. For the axis of symmetry x = -frac{a}{2} to lie within the interval [-2, 2], the inequality -2 leq -frac{a}{2} leq 2 must hold. 4. At the axis of symmetry, the discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4ac (where a=1, b=a, and c=3-a) must be less than or equal to zero for the function to have a minimum on the interval.

By solving each condition: - For f(-2) = 7 - 3a geq 0, we get a leq frac{7}{3}, but since -frac{a}{2} must be greater than or equal to -2, this condition leads to no solution. - For f(2) = 7 + a geq 0, we find that a geq -7. - For the axis of symmetry condition -2 leq -frac{a}{2} leq 2, we get -4 leq a leq 4. - And for the discriminant condition frac{12 - 4a - a^2}{4} geq 0, it simplifies to a^2 + 4a - 12 leq 0, which after factoring gives (a+6)(a-2) leq 0.

To demonstrate that this is possible, we can use a combinatorial and geometrical approach involving the concept of non-intersecting line segments. 1. **Choice of Pairing**:    - There are n! possible ways to pair the n red points with the n blue points. Let's consider all possible ways to match the red points with the blue points. 2. **Optimization Criterion**:    - Out of all possible pairings, select the pairing that minimizes the total length of the segments. This step ensures that we are working with an optimal configuration in terms of segment lengths. 3. **Assertion**:     - We need to show that the pairing with the minimum total length has no intersecting segments.  4. **Proof by Contradiction**:    - Assume that in the optimal pairing (the one with the minimum sum of segment lengths), there exist two segments that intersect. Let's say these segments are A B and C D, where A and C are red points, and B and D are blue points. 5. **Intersection Implies Suboptimality**:    - If A B and C D intersect, consider the alternative pairings A D and C B. Note that:      - The total length of A B + C D is greater than or equal to the total length of A D + C B. That’s because, for intersecting segments, switching the connections reduces the total distance, thereby achieving a shorter combined length:      [      AB + CD > AD + CB      ] 6. **Contradiction**:    - The existence of a more optimal pairing (lower total length) contradicts our selection of the pairing with the minimum total segment length. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Therefore, in any optimal pairing, the segments do not intersect. Hence, there exists a way to pair up the red and blue points such that no two segments intersect. This completes the proof. The solution demonstrates that it is always possible to draw n segments connecting n red points to n blue points without any intersections by choosing the optimal pairing that minimizes the total length of the segments. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Jeff's seven assignment scores are initially recorded as 85, 90, 87, 93, 89, 84, and 88.

Let (overline{mathrm{ab}}) represent the two-digit number, which can be written in the form (10a + b), where (a) and (b) are digits (0-9). 2. Let (overline{mathrm{cde}}) represent the three-digit number, which can be written in the form (100c + 10d + e), where (c), (d), and (e) are also digits (0-9). 3. According to the problem, we have the equation:    [    overline{mathrm{ab}} + overline{mathrm{cde}} = 1079    ]    Substituting the expressions for (overline{mathrm{ab}}) and (overline{mathrm{cde}}) into the equation, we get:    [    (10a + b) + (100c + 10d + e) = 1079    ]    Simplifying the equation, we have:    [    10a + b + 100c + 10d + e = 1079    ] 4.

Let's express the numbers by considering their maximum and minimum contributions:    - 1079 is a relatively large number, implying (c) plays a significant role. 5. Since (100c) is part of 1079, and (c) is a digit (0-9), (c) must be the highest digit possible such that (100c leq 1079). Thus:    [    100c leq 1079 implies c = 9    ]    Substituting (c = 9) back into the equation:    [    10a + b + 100 cdot 9 + 10d + e = 1079 implies 10a + b + 900 + 10d + e = 1079    ]    Simplifying further:    [    10a + b + 10d + e = 179    ] 6.

In other words, all weights must be either all even or all odd. 5. **Weight Reduction Strategy**:     - Subtract the smallest weight (or weights if there are multiple of the same smallest weight) from all weights.     - This transforms the initial set into a new set satisfying the same conditions as the original problem, with some weights potentially becoming zero.      6. **New System Analysis**:     - We now have a new system where weights still have the same parity throughout and some weights are zero.     - A weight of zero is even.     - Since we are dealing with only even weights or only odd weights, our goal is to show that the same previous argument holds in this new paradigm. 7. **Iteration and Conclusion**:     - By iteratively reducing the problem (subtracting the smallest weight) and exploring the parity, we can assume all weights start to tend towards the smallest positive integer possible.     - If any weight was different, after enough iterations through zero-weighting them, we’d reach a contradiction breaking problem’s conditions.

The vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} satisfy this requirement as they are formed by pairs of points lying on the plane. Firstly, let's calculate overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}: [ overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (1 - 0, -1 - 2, frac{5}{8} - frac{19}{8}) = (1, -3, -frac{14}{8}) = (1, -3, -frac{7}{4}) ] [ overrightarrow{AC} = C - A = (-2 - 0, 1 - 2, frac{5}{8} - frac{19}{8}) = (-2, -1, -frac{14}{8}) = (-2, -1, -frac{7}{4}) ] The normal vector to the plane alpha must be orthogonal to both overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC}.

As we look for a ratio and not the exact values, we can consider the simplest case where z = 1 and solve for x and y accordingly: [ begin{align*} x - 3y - frac{7}{4} &= 0 -2x - y - frac{7}{4} &= 0 end{align*} ] By solving these linear equations, we find that x = frac{2}{3} and y = -frac{1}{4}. We then obtain the ratio x:y:z = frac{2}{3}:-frac{1}{4}:1.  However, to express the ratio of x:y:z in integers, we need to scale these numbers by a common multiple to clear the fractions. Multiplying by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4), we get x:y:z = 8:-3:12.

Distance = Speed × Time Distance_X_before_Y = 35 mph × 1.2 hours = 42 miles Now, let's set up an equation to find out how long it takes for Car Y to catch up to Car X after Car Y starts. Let t be the time in hours that Car Y travels until both cars have traveled the same distance. Since Car X has a head start of 42 miles, we can write the equation for the distance Car X travels as: Distance_X = 42 miles + 35 mph × t For Car Y, which starts from rest and travels at 38 mph, the distance is: Distance_Y = 38 mph × t Since both cars stop when they have traveled the same distance, we can set the distances equal to each other: 42 miles + 35 mph × t = 38 mph × t Now, let's solve for t: 42 miles = (38 mph - 35 mph) × t 42 miles = 3 mph × t t = 42 miles / 3 mph t = 14 hours This means that Car Y travels for 14 hours to catch up to Car X.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so: 150 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1800 inches Now, we know each rung is 18 inches long. To find out how many rungs James can make from 1800 inches of wood, we divide the total length of wood by the length of each rung: 1800 inches / 18 inches/rung = 100 rungs Since the rungs are 6 inches apart, the space covered by each rung and the space after it until the next rung is 18 inches (length of the rung) + 6 inches (space between rungs) = 24 inches. However, for the last rung, there won't be a 6-inch space above it, so we need to subtract these 6 inches from the total height. Therefore, for 99 rungs, we will have the 24 inches, and for the last rung, we will only count its length (18 inches). So the total height covered by the rungs and the spaces between them is: 99 rungs * 24 inches/rung + 18 inches (for the last rung) = 2376 inches + 18 inches = 2394 inches Now, let's convert the height back to feet: 2394 inches / 12 inches/foot = 199.5 feet Therefore, the tree James wants to climb is approximately boxed{199.5}  feet tall."},{"instruction":"A circle with center C(1, 1) intersects a straight line l: x+y=4 to form a chord of length 2sqrt{3}.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius r, the distance from the center to the line d = sqrt{2}, and half the chord length sqrt{3}, we have:  r^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 + (sqrt{3})^2 = 2 + 3 = 5  Thus, the equation of the circle is (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 5.

Then angle S = angle T.    - Triangles triangle O_{1}SN and triangle O_{2}NT are similar (isosceles) so angle O_{1}NS = angle T and angle O_{2}NT = angle S.     - Hence, angle S = angle O_{1}NS = angle O_{2}NT.    - Therefore, O_{2}N is parallel to OS, and O_{1}N is parallel to OT.    - Thus, quadrilateral OO_{1}N_{2} is a parallelogram, and O_{2}=O_{1}N=r_{1}=MO_{1}.    - Hence, triangle O_{1}MO cong triangle O_{2}OM.    - Consequently, area of triangle O_{1}M = triangle O_{2}MM and O_{1}O_{2} parallel OM.    - Since O_{1}O_{2} perp MN, it follows that OM perp MN. 4. **Necessity**:    - Suppose OM perp MN and O_{1}O_{2} perp MN. Then O_{1}O_{2} parallel OM.    - Using the properties and the distances, prove that O, O_{1}, O_{2}, M form a cyclic quadrilateral and thus O_{1}N parallel OT and O_{2}N parallel OS.    - Therefore, S, N, and T are collinear. 5. **Full Proof Using Heron's Formula (Area Calculation for Triangles)**:    - Given OM = a,       - O1M = r1,       - O_{1}O = r - r_{1},       - O_{2}O = r - r_{2},       - O_{2}M = r_{2}.    - Perimeter p = frac{a+r}{2}.    - Using Heron's formula for areas:      - S_{triangle O_{1}mu} = sqrt{p(p-r_{1})(p-(r-r_{1}))(p-a)}.      - Similarly,      - S_{triangle O_{2}mu} = sqrt{p(p-r_{2})(p-(r-r_{2}))(p-a)}.    - Equating the areas, simplifying gives (r-r_{2})(r - r_{1} - r_{2}) = 0.     - Since r_{1} neq r_{2}, r = r_{1} + r_{2}.    - Using r = r_{1} + r_{2}, it concludes O_{1}O = r - r_{1} = r_{2} = O_{2}N, O_{2}O = r - r_{2} = r_{1} = O_{1}N.    - So, OO_{1}N_{2} is a parallelogram and hence S, N, and T are collinear.

On two of its opposite sides, isosceles triangles with angles of 120^{circ} at the vertices are constructed outside the parallelogram. Find the distance between these vertices.","output":"1. Consider the parallelogram (ABCD) with sides (AB = 1), (BC = 2), and the angle (angle A = 60^circ). 2. Outside (ABCD), construct isosceles triangles (ADE) and (BCF) with (angle AED = angle BFC = 120^circ) and (AE = DE = BF = FC = frac{BC}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}). 3. Observe that quadrilateral (BEDF) is a parallelogram since the opposite sides (BF) and (DE) are equal and parallel. Therefore, its diagonal (EF) passes through the midpoint (O) of diagonal (BD), which is the center of parallelogram (ABCD). 4. In triangle (ABD), note that side (AB = 1) is half the length of side (AD). Since (angle BAD = 60^circ), using the cosine rule (or recognizing the 30-60-90 triangle properties), we get (angle ABD = 90^circ). Consequently,  BD = AB cdot tan(60^circ) = 1 cdot sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}  and thus,  BO = frac{1}{2} BD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.  5. Calculate the angles:  angle CBD = angle ABC - angle ABD = 120^circ - 90^circ = 30^circ  and,  angle DBF = angle CBD + angle CBF = 30^circ + 30^circ = 60^circ.  6. Applying the cosine rule in triangle (OBF):   OF = sqrt{ BO^2 + BF^2 - 2 cdot BO cdot BF cdot cos(60^circ)}  = sqrt{ left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 - 2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{1}{2}}  = sqrt{ frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{3} - frac{2}{2} }  = sqrt{frac{9}{12} + frac{16}{12} - frac{12}{12}} = sqrt{frac{13}{12}}.  7. Therefore,  EF = 2 cdot OF = 2 sqrt{frac{13}{12}} = sqrt{frac{52}{12}} = sqrt{frac{13}{3}}.  8. For the isosceles triangles (ALB) and (CKD) with (angle L = angle K = 120^circ), prove that (O) is the midpoint of (KL). Using the cosine rule in triangle (OKD) yields:   OK = sqrt{ DO^2 + DK^2 - 2 cdot DO cdot DK cdot cos(120^circ)} = sqrt{left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{2}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 + 2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right)} = sqrt{frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{3} + frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{frac{9}{12} + frac{16}{12} + frac{6}{12}} = sqrt{frac{31}{12}}.  9. Therefore,  KL = 2 cdot OK = 2 sqrt{frac{19}{12}} = sqrt{frac{76}{12}} = sqrt{frac{19}{3}}.

Given that the death rate is 2 people every two seconds, the net increase in population every two seconds is (B - 2) people. We want to find the net increase in population over one day (24 hours). There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. Therefore, in 24 hours, there are 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds. Since the population changes every two seconds, we need to divide the total number of seconds in a day by 2 to find out how many times the population changes in a day: 86400 seconds / 2 seconds = 43200 changes in a day. The estimated size of the population net increase that occurs in one day is given as 172800. This net increase is the result of 43200 changes (every two seconds). Therefore, the net increase per change is: 172800 net increase / 43200 changes = 4 people per change. Since this net increase per change is the result of the birth rate minus the death rate (B - 2), we can set up the equation: B - 2 = 4 Now, we solve for B: B = 4 + 2 B = 6 So, the average birth rate in the city is boxed{6}  people every two seconds."},{"instruction":"Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,lambda),overrightarrow{b}=(2,lambda+2), and overrightarrow{a} is collinear with overrightarrow{b}, then lambda =left(  right) A: 1 B: 3 C: 2 D: 2","output":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,lambda) and overrightarrow{b}=(2,lambda+2) are collinear, this implies that the ratio of their corresponding components must be equal.

(Ⅱ) Let the coordinates of points M and N be (x_{1}, y_{1}) and (x_{2}, y_{2}), respectively.

Given ( n ) pairs of partners, each pair consists of a girl and a boy. 2. In the problem setup, the boys sit around a circular table. 3. For the first dance, each girl invites a boy (not necessarily her partner). 4. After the dance, the girl will take the boy back to his seat and for the next dance, she will invite the next boy counterclockwise.     To solve the problem, we need to determine for what ( n ) it is possible to arrange the boys around the table and determine the pairs for the first dance such that in each dance, at least one girl dances with the partner she came with.  For odd ( n ): 1. Assume ( n ) is odd, i.e., ( n = 2k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ). 2. Number the boys and the corresponding girls from ( 1 ) to ( n ).     Let each girl ( j ) invite:     [     begin{cases}      2j & text{if } j leq k,     2j - n & text{if } k + 1 leq j leq n.     end{cases}     ]          This ensures that for the first dance:     - The girl with number ( n ) will dance with her partner ( n ).     - Moving forward, the ( j )-th dance (where girls invite counterclockwise) will make the girl ( n - j + 1 ) dance with her partner.  Detailed observation: - If ( j leq k + 1 ):     - The girl ( n - j + 1 ) will initially dance with boy ( n - 2j + 2 ) and in the following dances will pair as required.       This confirms that girl ( n - j + 1 ) pairs with ( n - j + 1 ). - For ( j geq k + 2 ):     - The first dance for girl ( n - j + 1 ) is with boy ( 2n - 2j + 2 ) and after cycles will pair back correctly. By such an arrangement, it is clear that for odd ( n ), it is possible to have at least one girl dance with her partner in every dance.  For even ( n ):     1. Consider even ( n ).     Number the boys from ( 1 ) to ( n ). Let each girl ( j ) initially dance with the boy ( a_j ). 2.

This indicates that the hyperbola has its foci on the x-axis. The distance between the center and each focus for a hyperbola is given by sqrt{a^2+b^2}=sqrt{15+1}=sqrt{16}=4. Therefore, the foci of the hyperbola are at (-4,0) and (4,0).   The ellipse is given by frac{{x}^{2}}{25}+frac{{y}^{2}}{9}=1. This indicates that the ellipse also has its foci on the x-axis. The distance between the center and each focus for an ellipse is given by sqrt{a^2-b^2}=sqrt{25-9}=sqrt{16}=4. Therefore, the foci of the ellipse are also at (-4,0) and (4,0).   Since both the hyperbola and the ellipse have the same foci, option A is incorrect. - **For option B:**   The ellipse is given by frac{x^{2}}{4}+frac{y^{2}}{3}=1. This means a^2=4 and b^2=3, so c^2=a^2-b^2=4-3=1. Thus, the foci are at F_{1}(-1,0) and F_{2}(1,0), and the distance between the foci is |F_{1}F_{2}|=2.   For a triangle with base |F_{1}F_{2}|=2 and area 2, the height (which corresponds to |y_P| for a point P on the ellipse) must satisfy frac{1}{2}cdot2cdot|y_P|=2, leading to |y_P|=2. However, the maximum value of |y_P| for a point on the ellipse is sqrt{3}, which is less than 2. Therefore, there is no point P on the ellipse that satisfies {S}_{△P{F}_{1}{F}_{2}}=2, making option B incorrect. - **For option C:**   The given curve is C: frac{{x}^{2}}{4}-frac{{y}^{2}}{12}=1. The asymptotic lines of a hyperbola are given by y=±frac{b}{a}x. Here, a^2=4 and b^2=12, so a=2 and b=sqrt{12}=2sqrt{3}.

Thus, the second player has a winning strategy by consistently taking **1 stone** on each of their turns.

Simplifying the left side, we get x+2 = -mx + m because 1-x = -(x-1). 2. **Determine the condition for the equation to have a root**: The equation has a root when the denominator on both sides is not zero, which means x-1 neq 0 and 1-x neq 0. Both conditions lead to x neq 1. However, for the equation to make sense and to find the specific value of m, we consider the scenario where the equation simplifies to a form where x can be substituted. Thus, we mistakenly considered x-1=0 to find a specific solution, which should be corrected to finding a value of x that satisfies both sides of the equation after eliminating denominators correctly. 3. **Correcting the approach**: The correct step after eliminating denominators should focus on equating the numerators correctly, which leads to a misunderstanding in the initial solution. The correct approach is to realize that eliminating denominators as described initially was incorrect. Instead, we should equate the numerators directly due to the mistake in the process described.  4. **Find the value of m directly**: Given the mistake in the process, we directly look at the conditions set by the equation. The equation frac{x+2}{x-1}=frac{m}{1-x} implies that for the equation to hold true without finding a specific x, we need to ensure the numerators and denominators are proportionally equivalent. This means x+2 must be directly proportional to m in the same way x-1 is to 1-x. This leads to a misunderstanding in the solution process. 5. **Correct solution**: Recognizing the error in the process, we see that the initial step to eliminate denominators was incorrectly described, and the subsequent steps led to a confusion. The correct process involves equating the numerators after understanding that x+2 and m must be related in a way that does not depend on finding a specific value of x by setting x-1=0.  Therefore, the correct interpretation of solving the equation frac{x+2}{x-1}=frac{m}{1-x} involves recognizing the error in the solution process and understanding that the value of m should be determined by the relationship between the numerators and denominators directly, without incorrectly setting x-1=0 to find x=1.

Given the errors in the process, the final answer provided was m=-3, which was derived from a flawed process.

From the problem statement, we know that the number of sets of type A garbage bins that can be purchased with 18000 yuan is twice the number of sets of type B garbage bins that can be purchased with 13500 yuan. This gives us the equation: [ frac{18000}{x} = 2 times frac{13500}{x + 150} ] Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows: [ frac{18000}{x} = frac{27000}{x + 150} ] Cross-multiplying gives: [ 18000(x + 150) = 27000x ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 18000x + 2700000 = 27000x ] [ 2700000 = 9000x ] [ x = 300 ] Thus, the unit price of each set of type A garbage bin is 300 yuan.

To prove this inequality, we proceed as follows: 1. **Ordering the Angles and Sides:**    - Assume without loss of generality that a leq b leq c. Consequently, the triangle's angle measures should satisfy A leq B leq C. 2. **Application of the Rearrangement Inequality:**    - By the Rearrangement Inequality, we know for a leq b leq c and A leq B leq C,            aA + bB + cC geq aB + bA + cC,                  aA + bB + cC geq aC + bB + cA.

Expressing the weighted sum of angles, we have:            (a + b + c) pi - 2(aA + bB + cC).          - Therefore, we further refine this expression to:            (a + b + c)pi - 2(aA + bB + cC) > 0.          - Rearranging terms, we get:            2(aA + bB + cC) < (a + b + c)pi.       6. **Final Division:**    - Dividing by 2(a + b + c),            frac{aA + bB + cC}{a + b + c} < frac{pi}{2}.       # Conclusion: By combining our earlier results, we establish: boxed{frac{pi}{3} leq frac{aA + bB + cC}{a + b + c} < frac{pi}{2}}."},{"instruction":"Let alpha and beta be two distinct planes, and l be a line.

Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = k(x-1),  frac{x^{2}}{2}+y^{2}=1, end{cases} we get the quadratic equation (1+2k^{2})x^{2}-4k^{2}x+2k^{2}-2=0, with discriminant Δ=16k^{4}-4(1+2k^{2})(2k^{2}-2)=8k^{2}+8>0. Denote the coordinates of points A and B as A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2), respectively. Then, we have {x}_{1}+{x}_{2}= frac{4{k}^{2}}{1+2{k}^{2}} and {x}_{1}{x}_{2}= frac{2{k}^{2}−2}{1+2{k}^{2}}. Assume the fixed point M has coordinates M(t,0). Thus, overrightarrow{MA}=(x_1-t,y_1) and overrightarrow{MB}=(x_2-t,y_2). Then, overrightarrow{MA} cdot overrightarrow{MB} = (x_1 - t)(x_2 - t) + y_1 y_2 = x_1 x_2 - t(x_1 + x_2) + t^{2} + k^{2}(x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1). After substituting the expressions for x_1 + x_2 and x_1 x_2, we get overrightarrow{MA} cdot overrightarrow{MB} = frac{(2t^{2}-4t+1)k^{2}+(t^{2}-2)}{1+2k^{2}}. For overrightarrow{MA} cdot overrightarrow{MB} = λ (where λ is a constant), the equation frac{(2t^{2}-4t+1)k^{2}+(t^{2}-2)}{1+2k^{2}} = λ must hold true. This simplifies to (2t^{2}-4t+1-2λ)k^{2}+(t^{2}-2-λ)=0. In order for this equation to hold true for any real number k, the following system of equations must be satisfied: begin{cases} 2t^{2}−4t+1−2λ=0,  t^{2}−2−λ=0. end{cases} Solving this system of equations, we find that t=frac{5}{4} and λ=−frac{7}{16}. If line l is perpendicular to the x-axis, its equation is x=1. In this case, the intersection points of the line and the ellipse are A(1,−frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and B(1,−frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). Choosing the point M(frac{5}{4},0), we have overrightarrow{MA}=(−frac{1}{4},frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) and overrightarrow{MB}=(−frac{1}{4},−frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). Then, overrightarrow{MA} cdot overrightarrow{MB} = −frac{7}{16}.

According to the fare standard, the starting price is 10 yuan (i.e., a fare of 10 yuan is charged for a distance of up to 4 kilometers). For every additional kilometer beyond 4 kilometers, an extra 1.5 yuan is charged (distances less than 1 kilometer are rounded up to 1 kilometer). We can set up an equation to solve this. Given the total fare is 19 yuan, and the starting fare covers up to 4 kilometers, the fare for the distance beyond 4 kilometers is 19 - 10 = 9 yuan. Since each kilometer beyond 4 kilometers adds 1.5 yuan to the fare, the number of kilometers beyond 4 kilometers can be calculated as 9 / 1.5 = 6 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance traveled is 4 + 6 = 10 kilometers. However, since distances less than 1 kilometer are rounded up to 1 kilometer, to maximize the distance x, we should consider this rounding. Thus, the maximum value of x that can be achieved without increasing the fare beyond 19 yuan is just under 11 kilometers, but since we round up, the answer is 10 kilometers for the purpose of fare calculation.

This means if ( a ) and ( b ) are two numbers such that ( frac{a}{b} = 4 ) or ( frac{a}{b} = 8 ), then ( a ) and ( b ) must have different colors. 2. **Observing the Ratios:**    Note that ( 4^3 = 8^2 ). This implies that the powers of 4 and 8 are related in a way that can be exploited to find a coloring scheme. 3. **Defining the Function:**    Define a function ( f(a) = lfloor log_2 a rfloor ). This function maps a positive real number ( a ) to the greatest integer less than or equal to ( log_2 a ). 4. **Coloring Scheme:**    We will use the function ( f(a) ) to determine the color of ( a ). Specifically, we will use the value of ( f(a) mod 5 ) to assign colors:    - If ( f(a) equiv 0 pmod{5} ) or ( f(a) equiv 1 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Red.    - If ( f(a) equiv 2 pmod{5} ) or ( f(a) equiv 3 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Green.    - If ( f(a) equiv 4 pmod{5} ), color ( a ) Blue. 5. **Verification:**    - Consider two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( frac{a}{b} = 4 ).

Applying the definition of the derivative, we get:    [    f^{prime}(0) = lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{f(Delta x) - f(0)}{Delta x}    ] 4. Since ( f(0) = 0 ), we have:    [    f^{prime}(0) = lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{f(Delta x) - 0}{Delta x} = lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{e^{Delta x sin frac{5}{Delta x}} - 1}{Delta x}    ] 5. To evaluate the limit, we use the substitution of equivalent infinitesimals. Notice that:    [    e^{Delta x sin frac{5}{Delta x}} - 1 sim Delta x sin frac{5}{Delta x}    ]    as (Delta x rightarrow 0 ), because ( Delta x sin frac{5}{Delta x} rightarrow 0 ). 6. Thus, we can write:    [    f^{prime}(0) = lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{Delta x sin frac{5}{Delta x}}{Delta x}    ] 7. Simplifying, we get:    [    f^{prime}(0) = lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} sin frac{5}{Delta x}    ] 8. The limit ( lim_{Delta x rightarrow 0} sin frac{5}{Delta x} ) does not exist, as (sin frac{5}{Delta x}) oscillates between (-1) and (1) infinitely many times as ( Delta x ) approaches (0). # Conclusion: Since the limit does not exist, the derivative ( f^{prime}(0) ) does not exist.

To understand the problem, let's reiterate it: We are given a polyhedron where all edges are equal and the polyhedron touches a certain sphere. We need to determine whether it's always possible to circumscribe a sphere around such a polyhedron. 2. The statement is that the circumscribed sphere may not always exist. Here is an example to clarify this:    - Consider a cube.    - On each face of the cube, construct a regular square pyramid with a dihedral angle of 45^circ at the base, extending outward. 3. The resulting figure is a 12-faced polyhedron (specifically, a type of pyramid-studded cube). To analyze the vertices:    - Originally, the cube has 8 vertices.    - Each constructed pyramid adds an additional vertex at the apex, not coinciding with the original vertices.    - This results in a total of 14 vertices (8 from the original cube and 6 new apex vertices from the pyramids). 4. It can be observed that:    - All edges in this polyhedron are of equal length.    - These edges maintain a uniform distance from the center of the cube. 5. However, despite the uniform edge lengths, the new vertices cannot all lie on a single sphere. This deviation means the described polyhedron does not allow for a circumscribing sphere. 6. Conclusion: The existence of a polyhedron touching some sphere and having all edges equal does not guarantee that a circumscribed sphere can be drawn around it. Therefore, the solution concludes that such a sphere does not always exist, confirming that it is not a universal property for such polyhedra. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Calculate: (sqrt{7}1)^2(sqrt{14}sqrt{2})(sqrt{14}+sqrt{2}).","output":"To solve the given expression (sqrt{7}-1)^2-(sqrt{14}-sqrt{2})(sqrt{14}+sqrt{2}), we will break it down step by step: 1.

The solid angle subtended around the entire space by this rotation would be 2pi steradians if alpha = pi (half-space).     - Thus, the solid angle Omega is proportional to alpha:     [     Omega = 2alpha     ] **Conclusion**: The solid angle of a dihedral angle is indeed 2alpha, where alpha is the measure of the dihedral angle in radians. [ boxed{Omega = 2alpha} ]  Part (b): To prove that the solid angle of a polyhedral angle is sigma - (n-2)pi, where sigma is the sum of its dihedral angles: 1. **Understanding the Solid Angle of the Polyhedral Angle**:     - A polyhedral angle is formed by the intersection of n half-planes (or faces) meeting at a common point (vertex).     - The solid angle, Omega, of such a configuration can be related to the sum of its internal dihedral angles. 2. **Sum of Dihedral Angles**:     - Denote the sum of the dihedral angles of the polyhedral angle by sigma.     - Each vertex in n-faced solid contributes certain angles, but in 3-dimensional geometry, the total measure adjusts according to the spatial configuration. 3. **Euler's Polyhedral Formula (Generalized)**:     - For a polyhedral angle at a vertex, the crucial step is to recognize it behaves like an isolated part of a polyhedron.     - By combinatorial topology (often related to Euler's formula, V - E + F = 2 for polyhedra), the excess angle summing rules adjust to 3-dimensional stereometry. 4. **Deriving the Formula**:     - The formula simplifies understanding the face contribution and internal spaces:     - In radians, subtracting the intrinsic dimensions:     [     Omega = sigma - (n - 2)pi     ]     - This comes from reducing the excessive overlap counted in n - 2 planar faces not contributing direct angles but altering the measure by pi radians each. **Conclusion**: The solid angle of a polyhedral angle is sigma - (n-2)pi, where sigma is the sum of its dihedral angles.

Here's a step-by-step detailed strategy for Petya to find 5 genuine coins without giving any of these 5 coins to Vasya: 1. **Step 1**: Petya gives coin H to Vasya and asks him to compare A + B with C + D.     - If the scale balances, then coins A, B, C, and D are genuine because the fake coin cannot be one of these; it must be either E, F, G, or H.     - If the scale does not balance, then we will have a different course of action (discussed later). 2. **Step 2**: Assume the scales balanced in Step 1. Now we have determined that coins A, B, C, and D are genuine. Petya gives coin G to Vasya and asks him to compare A with E.     - If the scale does not balance, we know that F must be genuine. This is because if E or A is detected to be lighter or heavier, we can be sure that the imbalance is due to one false coin (since only one coin is fake).     - If the scale balances, then coin E is genuine. 3. **Step 3**: In case the scales did not balance in Step 1, implying that A + B ne C + D.     - If A + B is heavier, it suggests that among A, B, C, and D, precisely one coin is fake and lighter. Thus, E, F, and G can be considered genuine as they were not part of the imbalance.     - Petya can then give away coin D to Vasya and ask Vasya to compare A with B.         - If A and B balance, then coins A and B are genuine, and coin C is fake. Moreover, coins E, F, and G (already established) are genuine.         - If A and B do not balance, the heavier coin among A and B implies that the other coin is genuine. Here, coin C is genuine since C + D was lighter.

The vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola.    - The formula to complete the square is f(x) = aleft(x + frac{b}{2a}right)^2 - frac{b^2}{4a} + c.    - Applying this to our function, we get f(x) = 1left(x + frac{-4}{2 cdot 1}right)^2 - frac{(-4)^2}{4 cdot 1} + m.    - Simplifying, we find f(x) = (x - 2)^2 - 4 + m. 4. **Determine the value of m**: We are given that the minimum value of f(x) is -4. Since the vertex form of the quadratic function shows that the minimum value (when a > 0) is k, we have k = -4.    - From the completed square form, we have k = -4 + m.    - Setting k = -4, we find -4 = -4 + m.    - Solving for m, we get m = 0. 5. **Write the analytical expression**: With m = 0, the function becomes f(x) = x^2 - 4x. 6. **Find the minimum value**: The minimum value of the function is at the vertex (h, k).

(3) Overall Level of Understanding of Classical Culture Knowledge - The eighth grade students have a better overall level of understanding of classical culture knowledge. This conclusion is drawn from comparing the average, mode, and median scores of both grades:   - The average scores of both grades are equal, at 88.   - The median score of the eighth grade (91) is higher than that of the seventh grade (88). Therefore, considering the higher median score, it indicates that the eighth grade students have a better overall level of understanding, as the median is a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers.

The problem statement provides the equation:    [    a + b = tan frac{gamma}{2} (a tan alpha + b tan beta).    ] 2. Using the angle sum identity ( alpha + beta = pi - gamma ), we rewrite the above equation as:    [    (a + b) tan frac{pi - gamma}{2} = a tan alpha + b tan beta.    ] 3. Noting that ( tan (frac{pi - x}{2}) = cot frac{x}{2} ), the equation becomes:    [    (a + b) cot frac{gamma}{2} = a tan alpha + b tan beta.    ] 4. Rearranging the equation, we have:    [    a cot frac{gamma}{2} + b cot frac{gamma}{2} = a tan alpha + b tan beta.    ] 5.

The triangles O B_1 A_1, B_1 B_2 A_2, B_2 B_3 A_3, ldots are all equilateral. The side lengths are l_1, l_2, l_3, ldots respectively. 3. Denote S_n = l_1 + l_2 + ldots + l_n. Therefore, B_n is given by B_n = (S_n, 0). 4. For each n, the equation of the line segment B_{n-1} A_n is given by the line of slope sqrt{3} passing through (S_{n-1}, 0). Hence, the equation can be written as:    [    y = sqrt{3} left(x - S_{n-1}right).    ] 5. Since A_n is also on the curve y = sqrt{x}, we substitute y_n = sqrt{x_n} into the equation of the line:    [    y_n = sqrt{3} left(left(y_n^2right) - S_{n-1} right).    ] 6.

Which strings are good?","output":"1. **Lemma Proof:**    We need to prove that for all (i in {1, 2, dots, 2^n - 1}), ({2^n choose i}) is even.    By Lucas' Theorem, for any non-negative integers (m) and (n) and a prime (p), the binomial coefficient ({m choose n}) modulo (p) can be determined by the base-(p) representations of (m) and (n). Specifically,    [    {m choose n} equiv prod_{j=0}^k {m_j choose n_j} pmod{p}    ]    where (m = m_k m_{k-1} cdots m_0) and (n = n_k n_{k-1} cdots n_0) are the base-(p) representations of (m) and (n), respectively.    For (p = 2), (m = 2^n), and (i), we have:    [    {2^n choose i} equiv prod_{j=0}^{n-1} {1 choose i_j} pmod{2}    ]    where (i = i_{n-1} i_{n-2} cdots i_0) is the binary representation of (i).    Since ({1 choose 0} = 1) and ({1 choose 1} = 1), but ({1 choose i_j} = 0) for (i_j > 1), it follows that:    [    {2^n choose i} equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    for any (i) that is not a power of 2. Therefore, ({2^n choose i}) is even for all (i in {1, 2, dots, 2^n - 1}). 2. **Application to the Problem:**    We need to determine the number of good strings (S) of length 99 with 66 (A)'s and 33 (B)'s such that for each (n) (where (1 leq n leq 99)), the substring made from the first (n) characters of (S) has an odd number of distinct permutations.    The number of distinct permutations of a substring of length (n) with (b) (B)'s is given by ({n choose b}). For this to be odd, ({n choose b}) must be odd. 3. **Analysis of Substrings:**    - For (n = 64), the substring must have 0 (B)'s because ({64 choose x}) is even for any (x in {1, 2, dots, 33}). Thus, the first 64 characters must all be (A)'s.    - For (n = 65), the substring must have 1 (B) because ({65 choose 1} = 65) is odd.    - For (n = 66), the substring must have 1 (B) because ({66 choose 1} = 66) is even, so the 66th character must be (A).    - For (n = 67), the substring must have 2 (B)'s because ({67 choose 2}) is odd.    - For (n = 68), the substring must have 2 (B)'s because ({68 choose 2}) is even, so the 68th character must be (A).    Continuing this pattern, we find that the string must have the form:    [    A^{64} B A B A B cdots B A B    ]    where the first 64 characters are (A)'s, followed by alternating (B)'s and (A)'s. 4. **Conclusion:**    The only good string that satisfies the conditions is:    [    A^{64} B A B A B cdots B A B    ] The final answer is ( boxed{ A^{64} B A B A B cdots B A B } )"},{"instruction":"A dog has three trainers:   The first trainer gives him a treat right away.

For the set M, the inequality (x+2)(x-1)<0 represents the values of x for which the product of (x+2) and (x-1) is negative. The critical points where the inequality changes its sign are x=-2 and x=1. Hence, we have two intervals to consider: (-infty, -2) and (-2, 1). Since the inequality is less than zero, we find that x must lie between the two roots, giving us the solution set M={x mid -2<x<1}. Next, for the set N, the inequality x+1<0 simplifies to x<-1. Therefore, the set N consists of all x values less than -1, which we write as N={x mid x<-1}. The intersection M cap N consists of all x values that are in both M and N. We have M={x mid -2<x<1} and N={x mid x<-1}.

Can they form 10 consecutive whole numbers? 1. To determine whether seven whole numbers can form ten consecutive whole numbers as pairwise sums, we'll denote the seven numbers as (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5). 2. Consider the sum modulo 2 of our numbers. If our numbers were to yield ten consecutive numbers as sums, we need to analyze the properties of these sums. 3. Observe that the sums corresponding to any two integers ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) will have different parities based on the parities of (a_i) and (a_j):    - Define the parities (Even or Odd) of each individual number ( a_i ). 4. As there are seven whole numbers, they must fall into combinations of parities:    - Suppose without loss of generality that (a) is even: ( a_i = 2n ) (where n is an integer).    - Suppose without loss of generality that (b) is odd: ( a_j = 2m + 1 ) (where m is an integer). 5. Calculate the sums:    - (a_i + a_i) would be even.    - (a_i + a_j) would be odd.    - (a_j + a_j) would be even.    - (a_j + a_k) (if k ≠ j) would be odd. 6. For the sums to be consecutive integers, their remainders modulo 2 must alternate ideally. However, as there are seven numbers and considering different scenarios:    - To maintain sequentiality, the sums of these pairs coming up with different parities would breach forming consecutive series since alternating sums might miss sequential properties. 7. Summing parities and their combinations often lead to non-sequential patterns:    - Suppose you have (a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_7). Then you sum pairwise combinations, the nature of their consecutive values diverges. 8. Given any seven numbers, permutation may not yield merely shifts in parity producing regular int sequence, deviates—from alternating sums (a_i + a_i), (a_j + a_k) non-sequential consistency. # Conclusion: Thus, it can be shown with logical parity sequentiality analysis, sum varieties destabilizing forming pure sequences.

This will imply that the circumcircle of triangle DLF is tangent to Gamma. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since angle DLC = angle DBC + angle FDC, it follows that the circumcircle of triangle DLF is tangent to Gamma.

All club members are honest. 2. Some students are not honest. 3. No student who is in the fraternity is a club member. **Step-by-step Deduction**: 1. **Considering Statement II and I:** Since some students are not honest and all club members are honest, these dishonest students cannot be club members. 2. **Considering Statement III:** Directly states that no student who is a fraternity member can be a club member. This explicitly declares a separation between fraternity members (who are students) and club membership.     **Conclusion Analysis**: - **Option A (Some club members are not students):** Possible but not necessarily true based on given statements. - **Option B (All students are club members):** Clearly false because some students are not honest (Statement II contradicts all students can be club members as per Statement I). - **Option C (No fraternity member is a club member):** True, as directly stated in Statement III. - **Option D (Some fraternity members are students):** True by definition, but it asks for a necessary conclusion from the given statements specifically about the relationships, making it a tricky option. - **Option E (All club members are students):** Not necessarily true as it is possible that there could be honest non-students who are club members. Conclusively, the only claim that is explicitly derived from and necessary due to the statements is that no fraternity member is a club member. text{C} No fraternity member is a club member.
