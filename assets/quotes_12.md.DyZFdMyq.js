Over the centuries, Weimar remained a small town of less than 5,000 inhabitants. When it became the capital of Saxe-Weimar in 1572, population growth was stimulated and population increased from 3,000 in 1650 to 6,000 in 1750. Around the year 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. Their number grew constantly over the years to 13,000 in 1850, 28,000 in 1900 and 35,000 at the beginning of World War I. During the interwar period, the new capital of Thuringia saw a population boom, which led to 65,000 inhabitants in 1940. Since that time, the population levels have stagnated. The years 2009 to 2012 brought a moderate growth of approximately 0.35% p. a., whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Weimar. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. Answer this question based on the article: How many more people did Weimar have in 1800 than they had in 1750?","output":"To find out how many more people Weimar had in 1800 than in 1750, we need to look at the given population numbers for these years. In 1800, Weimar had 7,000 inhabitants. In 1750, Weimar had 6,000 inhabitants. Now we can calculate the difference in population between these two years: 7,000 inhabitants (in 1800) - 6,000 inhabitants (in 1750) = 1,000 inhabitants So, Weimar had 1,000 more people in 1800 than they had in 1750."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a young journalist, Bahadur was determined to break into the field of international journalism and distinguish himself from his peers. Motivated by his passion for discovery and his desire to present unexplored stories to the world, Jay Bahadur focused his journalistic efforts on Somalia. At the time, Somalia was plagued by rampant piracy along its coasts, which posed a significant threat to international shipping channels. This prompted him to delve deeply into the world of Somali pirates and document their activities for the wider world to understand. In 2008, Bahadur embarked on a daring journey to the semi-autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia, where he spent three months interviewing various pirates, their families, and local officials. His goal was to investigate the motives behind piracy, the pirates' organizational structure, and the socioeconomic and political factors that contributed to the rise of piracy in the region. In 2011, Bahadur published \\"The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden World,\\" which became an instant success and catapulted him into the global spotlight. The book provides an intriguing and comprehensive account of his experiences infiltrating the dangerous world of Somali pirates. It explores their motivations, internal dynamics, and operational tactics, as well as the international response to this maritime menace. Aside from highlighting the inner workings of the pirate world, \\"The Pirates of Somalia\\" also exposes the complex interplay between the pirates and the international community. It examines the failures of various governments and organizations to tackle the piracy problem effectively, and shows how it is tied to a web of political, economic, and social issues both within Somalia and beyond. Jay Bahadur's work on \\"The Pirates of Somalia\\" earned him accolades and respect in the field of journalism. It has been translated into numerous languages and draws attention to the critical issue of maritime security. As a groundbreaking exposé, Bahadur's book has undoubtedly contributed greatly to our understanding of modern piracy and the conditions in which it flourishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER III.  FACE TO FACE.  When Eustace Le Neve returned to lunch at Penmorgan that day he was silent to his host about Trevennack of Trevennack. To say the truth, he was so much attracted by Miss Cleer's appearance that he didn't feel inclined to mention having met her. But he wanted to meet her again for all that, and hoped he would do so. Perhaps Tyrrel might know the family, and ask them round to dine some night. At any rate, society is rare at the Lizard. Sooner or later, he felt sure, he'd knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere. And that involved the probability of knocking up against the mysterious stranger's beautiful daughter.  Next morning after breakfast, however, he made a vigorous effort to induce Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from Penmorgan Point toward the Rill and Kynance. It was absurd, he said truly, for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the most beautiful spot in it. But Tyrrel was obdurate. On the point of actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldn't yield one jot or tittle. Only, after much persuasion, he consented at last to cross the headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above St. Michael's Crag, provided always Eustace would promise he'd neither go near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it.  Satisfied with this lame compromise--for he really wished his host to enjoy that glorious view--Eustace Le Neve turned up the valley behind the house, with Walter Tyrrel by his side, and after traversing several fields, through gaps in the stone walls, led out his companion at last to the tor on the headland.  1. who wanted Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff? 2. what could be seen from there? 3. had the proprietor of the estate ever been there? 4. who was the proprietor of the estate? 5. who was Eustace attracted to? 6. did he want to meet her again? 7. what is rare at the Lizard? 8. did Tyrrel want to go up the cliff? 9. did he yield at all on that topic? 10. how so? 11. did he have any conditions? 12. what did Eustace think of the comprimise? 13. did he think it was lame? 14. what did they traverse together? 15. what did they go through?","output":"1.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, both of these sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but there are slight differences in emphasis and structure. The primary message of both sentences is that by the middle of the 7th century, alchemy had transformed into a discipline that was heavily influenced by mysticism. In the first sentence, the inclusion of the word \\"almost\\" before \\"entirely\\" adds a slight emphasis to the extent to which alchemy had become mystical. It implies that while alchemy was not completely a mystical discipline, it was very close to being so. In the second sentence, the word \\"almost\\" comes before \\"mystical discipline,\\" which softens the emphasis on how mystical alchemy was. In this case, the focus is more on the fact that alchemy had come close to becoming a mystical discipline. Structurally, the two sentences are inverted, with the descriptive phrase coming earlier in the first sentence and later in the second sentence. This subtle difference does not change the overall meaning, but it may impact readers' perception of which aspect of the sentence is more important – the timeline (middle of the 7th century) or the nature of alchemy (mystical discipline). In conclusion, while the sentences both convey the same fundamental meaning, their differences in emphasis and structure may impact the reader's perception slightly. Overall, though, a reader is likely to understand both sentences as conveying the same core message: by the middle of the 7th century, alchemy had become very much a mystical discipline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He desperately missed his wife, who was in Virginia, and his longing to see her led him to make a fateful decision. On May 23, 1969, after heavy drinking, Meyer posed as a captain to gain control of a USAF C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Though he was only licensed for a small single-engine plane, he managed to take off successfully with the large cargo plane.  During the flight, Meyer contacted his wife, who later reported the call to the Air Force Times. However, Sgt. Meyer also radioed the base about flight problems he was experiencing. Then, he disappeared from radar approximately 200 miles away over the English Channel. Eyewitnesses claim that the plane exploded upon impact with the water. The official military account offers no explanation for the crash, and Meyer's body was never recovered, leaving his fate shrouded in mystery. Nearly 50 years later, a group of wreck divers known as Deeper Dorset is hoping to find the lost C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and uncover the truth behind Meyer's last night. Simon Brown, a member of the diving group, spoke to the BBC about Meyer's last flight: \\"He did a fantastic job to get a complex plane off the runway. Whether he flew into [a] cloud and got disoriented or was shot down, we're not discounting anything.\\" To fund their search effort, Deeper Dorset has launched a Kickstarter page. The group plans to use 3D photogrammetry technology to locate the C-130 in an area that is likely filled with numerous lost ships and WWII planes. The founder of Deeper Dorset, Grahame Knott, acknowledges that some people may think their mission is futile, but they remain focused on their goal.

Mr. Putin compared the White House’s arguments to the erroneous intelligence findings on weapons of mass destruction that drew the United States into war with Iraq in 2003.      “To my mind, this strongly resembles what happened in 2003 when representatives of the United States showed in the Security Council what was supposed to be chemical weapons found in Iraq,” Mr. Putin said after a meeting with President Sergio Mattarella of Italy. Using an acronym for the Islamic State, he added, “A military campaign in Iraq ensued, and it ended in devastation of the country, growth of the terror threat and emergence of ISIL on the international scene.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Trump on Tuesday defended the missile strikes after the chemical attack, even as he declared that United States involvement in Syria would be limited.

They asserted that the Syrian government, under pressure from opposition forces around the country and lacking enough troops to respond, used the lethal nerve agent sarin to target rebels who were threatening government-held territory.      During his daily White House news briefing, Mr. Spicer would not comment on the possibility that the Russian government had known in advance of Syria’s plan to carry out the chemical attack, or to launch a subsequent assault on a hospital that was treating victims.

He said Russia was either incompetent or inattentive in its failure to secure and destroy Mr. Assad’s chemical weapons stockpiles. “But this distinction doesn’t much matter to the dead,” Mr. Tillerson said. “We can’t let this happen again.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      At the Pentagon, several officials said the presence of Russian personnel at the Al Shayrat airfield, used to launch the chemical strike, points to at least a possibility that Russia knew about the chemical attack. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday refused to make that direct accusation.      “It was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it,” Mr. Mattis said at a news conference, when asked whether Russia was involved. “We know what I’ve just told you. We don’t know anything beyond that.”      The Holes in Russia’s Account of the Syria Chemical Attack The available evidence contradicts much of what the Russian government has said about a toxic attack that killed more than 100 people.      Mr. Mattis also declined to confirm reports that a Russian drone was flying over a hospital treating victims of the chemical attack last week, in advance of the hospital being bombed.

The report cited a video and commercial satellite imagery that showed that the chemical weapon had landed in the middle of a road, not at a weapons facility.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the two military high schools? ?  In 2007, there were about 4,350 schools, about half of which were primary schools; on average, each school had 688 students. In recent years, Istanbul's educational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than 60 percent. Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire. It is one of Turkey's Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish. The city also has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners.Kuleli Military High School, along the shores of the Bosphorus in Çengelköy, and Turkish Naval High School, on one of the Princes' Islands, were military high schools, complemented by three military academies—the Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Both schools were shut Darüşşafaka High School provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darüşşafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign language—German or French. Other prominent high schools in the city include Istanbul Lisesi (founded in 1884), Kabataş Erkek Lisesi (founded in 1908) and Kadıköy Anadolu Lisesi (founded in 1955).

Passage:It would seem that Gill's interests lay elsewhere since after a few years he sold the business, and then spent time equipping Lord Lindsay's private observatory at Dun Echt, Aberdeenshire. In 1874, Gill joined the expedition to Mauritius to observe the transit of Venus. Three years later he went to Ascension Island to observe a near approach of Mars and to calculate its distance. While carrying out these laborious calculations, he was notified of his appointment to the Cape Observatory, which, over the following 27 years he was to refurbish completely, turning it into a first-rate institution. Gill was a meticulous observer and had a flair for getting the best out of his instruments. His solar parallax observations with a heliometer and his calculations of distances to the nearer stars, are testimony to his outstanding work. He recruited Robert Innes to the Cape Observatory.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton \`\` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \\"Bob\\" Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Emesinae, or thread-legged bugs, are a subfamily of the Reduviidae (i.e., assassin bugs). They are conspicuously different from the other reduviids by their very slender body form. They are stalking, predatory insects that can be collected on palm fronds, cliffs, spider webbing, or near lights at night (many can be collected by blacklight). They walk on their mid and hind legs; the front pair is raptorial. Some groups specialize on spiders. Very little is known about emesines except that many species are found in the tropics. Pedro Wygodzinsky wrote the most recent revision of this group.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Pseudometapterus is a little - known genus of thread - legged bug in the subfamily Emesinae . Members of the genus occur in North America and usually have wings that are extremely small or absent entirely , though a winged form of P. umbrosus is known from Southern Illinois .  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Reduviidae are a large cosmopolitan family of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are slightly unusual overall, but very common among the Hemiptera because almost all are terrestrial ambush predators (most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic). The main examples of nonpredatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Though spectacular exceptions are known, most members of the family are fairly easily recognizable; they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build, and formidable curved proboscis (sometimes called a rostrum). Large specimens should be handled with caution, if at all, because they sometimes defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis.  - The tropics are a region of the Earth surrounding the equator. They are delimited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere at  N and the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere at  S; these latitudes correspond to the axial tilt of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the tropical zone and the torrid zone (see geographical zone). The tropics include all the areas on the Earth where the Sun is at a point directly overhead at least once during the solar year (which is a subsolar point).  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - The term raptorial implies much the same as \\"predatory\\", but most often refers to modifications of an arthropod's foreleg that make it function for the grasping of prey while it is consumed, where the gripping surfaces are formed from the opposing faces of two successive leg segments (see illustration). This is distinctly different from the grasping mechanism of a structure such as a scorpion's claw (a \\"chela\\") in which one of the opposing surfaces is an articulated digit, and not a leg segment. While this is most widely known in mantises, similarly modified legs can be found in some crustaceans (e.g., mantis shrimp), and various insect families, such as Mantispidae, Belostomatidae, Nepidae, and Naucoridae (all members of these groups have raptorial forelegs). There are numerous other lineages within various insect families that have raptorial forelegs, most commonly seen in the family Reduviidae, but also including several different families of flies, and a few thrips.    What is the relationship between 'pseudometapterus' and 'reduviidae'? A:","output":"Pseudometapterus is a genus of thread-legged bugs within the subfamily Emesinae. The relationship between Pseudometapterus and Reduviidae is that Pseudometapterus is a part of the Reduviidae family, which is a large cosmopolitan family of insects belonging to the order Hemiptera (true bugs). In other words, Pseudometapterus is a specific group of thread-legged bugs that fall under the larger category of assassin bugs, which are members of the Reduviidae family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Frustration, because they were abruptly pulled out of an immersive and captivating experience just before finding out what would happen next. The alarm interrupted the story at a crucial moment, and they were unable to see its conclusion. Confusion, as they transitioned from the dream world to reality, they had to process the sudden shift in their environment and make sense of the situation. Their mind was likely still caught up in the dream, which could have left them momentarily disoriented. Relief, since they were in a somewhat uncomfortable and creepy situation in the dream where they were going up the endless escalator and being poked by an unknown figure. Waking up from that experience may have provided a sense of security as they returned to the familiarity of their real surroundings. Lastly, curiosity, because they were likely eager to know the ending of the dream and understand the significance of the events that took place. Their mind may have been filled with questions about what could have happened, and they might have been left with a desire to explore the dream further if given the chance. Overall, the experience of being pulled out of an intense and intriguing dream by an alarm can elicit a wide range of dynamic emotions, spanning from frustration to curiosity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who wrote an autobiography in 1936? ?  Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite... The answer to this question is:","output":"Stravinsky. In the text, it states that \\"in his 1936 autobiography\\" Stravinsky described the origin of the work, which refers to the autobiography written by him in 1936."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

The comments by Shao Qiwei, director of China's State Administration of Tourism, came a day after Shanghai's mayor Han Zheng said the city was preparing to build China's second Disney theme park. \\"China has a very large population. We now have 1.3 billion people. The market is very large. As far as I know, Hong Kong Disneyland is now very crowded,\\" said Shao, whose comments were broadcast on Hong Kong's Cable TV. The Hong Kong theme park, which opened in September, was widely criticized in January when it turned away hundreds of Lunar New Year holiday makers from mainland China because the park was full. Chaos  erupted when angry crowds tried to force their way into the park. The embarrassing incident prompted a public apology from Hong Kong Disneyland Managing Director Bill Ernest and a dressing down from Hong Kong's leader Donald Tsang. Authorities are carefully studying the issue of overcrowding in preparation for the possible building of the Disney park in Shanghai, Shao said. The official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday that no agreement has been reached on the park in Shanghai, quoting senior vice president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Leslie Goodman.

The club has a rich history and plays in the Gallagher Premiership, the top tier of English rugby.  Northampton Saints' inception dates back to 1880 when a group of local clergy and townspeople founded the club. Throughout the years, the club experienced various successes and challenges. However, it wasn't until 1965 when the club permanently made Franklins Gardens its home ground. Located in the St. James district of Northampton, Franklins Gardens has undergone several transformations, constantly upgrading its facilities to comply with modern rugby requirements. The stadium can now hold up to 15,249 spectators. A comprehensive redevelopment project was completed in 2016, resulting in a state-of-the-art stadium complex with several attractive features such as the Barwell Stand, which replaced the old Sturtridge Pavilion, the Carlsberg Stand, the Church's Stand, and the Tetley's Stand. Additionally, the stadium encompasses conference and training facilities, making it suitable for hosting various events in addition to rugby matches. Northampton Saints' mascot, Bernie, a delightful Saint Bernard dog, entertains the crowd and brings a jovial atmosphere to match days at Franklins Gardens. The Saints have a strong fan base, affectionately known as the \\"Saints Nation,\\" who passionately support the club and create an electrifying environment during home games at Franklins Gardens. The club fosters a strong culture of inclusiveness, and fans are encouraged to become members of the Northampton Saints family, establishing lasting relationships with the club and fellow supporters. Over the years, Northampton Saints have enjoyed numerous successes. They have won the English Premiership title once (in the 2013-2014 season), and they have been runners-up several times.

In conclusion, Franklins Gardens provides a splendid home for Northampton Saints. The club has a strong history of success, and its supporters are enthusiastic and deeply invested in the team's achievements. With its modern facilities and a passionate fan base, Franklins Gardens continues to be an essential part of the Northampton Saints' story as they compete in the Gallagher Premiership and strive for further success in the world of rugby union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The Commerce Department said gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual pace of 1.1% in the quarter, up from an earlier estimate of 0.8%. The upwards revision was helped by stronger export sales. However, growth in consumer spending was revised down to 1.5%, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2014. That weaker number was a reflection of slowing spending in service sectors such as health care and weak consumer spending during a harsh winter in many regions of the US.

The Commerce Department also revised upwards its estimate for the growth in the fourth quarter of  2015 to an annualised pace of 1.4% The upward revision is a positive sign for growth in the current quarter, but there are concerns that the impact of the UK's decision to leave the European Union could send shockwaves through the US economy, slowing growth in the autumn.

The verdict makes Lee Seok-ki -- a member of South Korea's left-wing United Progressive Party -- the country's first sitting lawmaker to be convicted of treason since the 1980s. Lee was found guilty of leading a secret group of 130 members with alleged links to North Korea. Tension in the Korean peninsula escalated in early 2013, when Pyongyang declared an armistice agreement between the two Koreas invalid and said it could carry out nuclear strikes against its southern neighbor. The court was told that Lee thought that the heightened tensions could lead to war between the North and South, and he allegedly directed members of the group to attack major national facilities in the event of such a conflict. \\"Piecing together the statements from the informants and evidences ... the defendants are found guilty for conspiring to start riots aimed at subverting the constitution,\\" Suwon District Court said in a statement. It said a strong penalty was inevitable because Lee's plot \\"posed substantial and clear threats to the existence of Korea and order of liberal democracy.\\" Under South Korean criminal law, a crime of rebellion can be committed when more than two people gather to conspire treason. Lee denied all charges against him, while his party, the Unified Progressive Party, described the case as \\"a medieval witch-hunt.\\" Some local media and analysts said the investigation was being used to divert attention from allegations that South Korea's state spy agency - the National Intelligence Service - had been involved in manipulating South Korea's 2012 presidential election.

When Dr V came to see me some weeks ago, he brought with him the bottle of strychnine that now sits empty upon my desk. He was in high spirits, because his latest alchemical experiment had been a success, and brought the strychnine in order to demonstrate the efficacy of his elixir. In truth, his very presence could be considered proof, since he had been dead earlier that morning, but, as I had not witnessed his revival, he wished me to see the results first hand. At his request, I summoned the chambermaid, while he prepared a syringe of strychnine. I thought he would ask her to procure a hen or some such thing for use in his demonstration however, when she arrived, Dr V-- plunged the syringe into her arm with no warning. I leapt from my chair, but before I could do more than cross the room, the strychnine took effect with results that horrified me. Even though I had complete confidence in Dr V's elixir, I could not restrain a cry of dismay as the chambermaid's head tilted back in a sudden convulsion.

A: Beyond combat flight crew personnel, perhaps the most dangerous USAF jobs are Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Combat rescue officer, Pararescue, Security Forces, Combat Control, Combat Weather, Tactical Air Control Party, and AFOSI agents, who deploy with infantry and special operations units who disarm bombs, rescue downed or isolated personnel, call in air strikes and set up landing zones in forward locations.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"The given answer provides a list of some of the specialized missions in the USAF, but it does not specifically explain what these individuals do when deployed with infantry, though it does mention some general functions. Let me break down a few of these roles and relate them directly to their duties when deployed with the infantry: 1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD): The EOD technicians deployed with infantry are responsible for locating, identifying, and safely disposing of any hazardous or unexploded ordnance, as well as improvised explosive devices, to protect the lives of the infantry members and ensure the mission's success. 2. Pararescue: When deployed with infantry, pararescuemen often provide crucial medical support, including advanced life-saving care, and are responsible for extracting and recovering injured personnel in combat or hazardous environments. 3. Security Forces: Security Forces personnel are responsible for defending and protecting USAF bases, equipment, and personnel when deployed with an infantry unit. They can be tasked with ensuring the safety and security of the area, preventing unauthorized access, and conducting patrols. 4. Combat Control: When deployed with the infantry, combat controllers help in coordinating air support and facilitating communication between the infantry and aircraft. They can call in airstrikes, manage air traffic, and guide aircraft to landing zones. 5. Tactical Air Control Party (TACP): TACPs deploy with infantry to serve as the link between ground forces and air assets. They provide close air support, call in air strikes, and give guidance on aerial reconnaissance and surveillance missions. By elaborating on these roles when deployed with the infantry, the answer more accurately and thoroughly addresses the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To make a cedar oil rub for your furniture, follow these steps: 1. Gather materials:  - Cedarwood essential oil (100% pure) - A carrier oil of your choice, such as fractionated coconut oil, sweet almond oil, or jojoba oil - A small mixing bowl - A measuring spoon or dropper - A glass bottle or jar for storage - A clean, soft cloth 2. Determine the desired ratio: First, you'll need to decide how strong you want the cedar oil fragrance to be in your rub. A common ratio is 2% for dilution, which means that you'll use 2 drops of essential oil per teaspoon (roughly 5 ml) of carrier oil. For a stronger scent, you can use a higher concentration of essential oil, but be cautious when applying it to finished or delicate furniture surfaces. 3. Mix cedarwood essential oil and carrier oil: Begin by measuring out the carrier oil into the mixing bowl. You will need approximately 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of carrier oil for every 2 drops of cedarwood oil. For example, if you use 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of carrier oil, then you will need to add 4 drops of cedarwood oil. Add the appropriate number of drops of cedarwood essential oil to the mixing bowl. 4. Combine the oils: Mix the cedarwood essential oil and carrier oil together thoroughly using a spoon. Be sure to blend well to ensure an even distribution of the essential oil throughout the carrier oil. 5. Transfer to storage container: Carefully pour or use a dropper to transfer the cedar oil rub mixture into a glass bottle or jar for storage. Be sure to use a dark-colored glass container to protect the cedar oil rub from sunlight, which can reduce its potency. 6. Label the container: Use a permanent marker or a label to indicate the contents of the jar, including the type of essential oil used (cedarwood) and the date of creation. This will help you keep track of your cedar oil rub's potency and maintain its efficacy. 7. Apply the cedar oil rub: To use your cedar oil rub on your furniture, pour a small amount onto a clean, soft cloth, and gently rub it into the wood surface, following the grain of the wood. Use a clean side of the cloth to buff away any excess oil. Be sure to test the cedar oil rub on a small, inconspicuous area of your furniture first to see how it reacts to the finish or fabric. 8. Store the cedar oil rub: Keep your cedar oil rub in a cool, dark place (like a cabinet or pantry) when not in use to preserve its potency. Make sure the container is sealed tightly to prevent the oils from evaporating. By using this cedar oil rub, you'll not only give your furniture a beautiful, natural sheen, but you'll also impart a pleasant, soothing cedar scent throughout your home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism?, using the article: The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda., what would be the answer ?

Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army.

So, one night at a party, he hears some ex-roadie tell him a classic bit of rock n' roll lore; the one about how Gram Parsons' corpse was stolen from LAX by his loyal roadie so he could honor Parsons' wishes that he be cremated out in JoshuaTree. Wow! What a great idea for a movie! Rock n' Roll (well, country), grave robbing, escapes, friendship, the 70's! I guess we could get Johnny Knoxville from \\"Jackass\\", cause it's kind of a prank, right, and Knoxville wants to do \\"a movie\\" too. Why he must have thought he had the next \\"Snatch\\" on his hand! But this story's not really that exciting...we need something for Knoxville to struggle against.like a psychotic girlfirend after his money! But Parsons' was married at the time. That's O.K., no one knows that. Besides we could get Christina Applegate. But what if the audience doesn't like the idea of stealing a corpse.well, we'll get his dad to join the chase, but give permission in the end. But Parsons' dad killed himself when he was 10, in fact his orphan status, and tragic childhood, are key parts of the Parsons Mythology. Mythology? We're making \\"A Movie!\\" This is creative problem solving. It's an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely knowledgeable on or interested in the subject. Applegate's presence is doubling jarring. First her invented character is a Beverly Hills bitch before her time -she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand, and secondly, what kind of man would Parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of harpy? Facts aren't just distorted or left out, but REVERSED. They could have easily found the villain they wanted in Parsons STEPfather, who was attempting to whisk the body back to his home state where law would favor him in dividing up the considerable inheritance. And the music, oh, the music I love. The music is hacked up (the bridge of a song here, the chorus there), forced to the background, and in the end, horribly covered by the hippest new indie band, Starsailor. My girlfriend asked the unnecessary, but irresistable question after the movie --was anyone up there, the writer, the producers, the director, actually a Gram Parson's fan? Well, no. He'd never actually heard of Gram Parsons, but of course, blah blah blah, I learned to love it, and here's some factoids I read in a bio online. Another guy vouched for Parsons' coolness by saying he and Keith Richards tripped on acid together and wrote \\"Wild Horses\\" together, a mixed up bunch of facts as off-base as the movie. Another person asked, wasn't it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film? Well, he had the real roadie's permission (he was even set) and the Parsons estate gave permission, and all these other people who got paychecks said it was great. But what I really wondered was, and asked in the embarassingly trembling voice of a truly impassioned Parsons geek, was, if the movie's so cheaply made (a million), had they not considered the original Gram Parsons fanbase as an audience? The director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase, though I doubt any Mojo magazine reading, country-rock 70's music fan would agree. But a bunch of Brits made it I guess, and they just didn't care about Cosmic American Music, or even knew it existed. This isn't just not a truthful Parsons flick, it's not even in the right spirit -it doesn't even fit the legend. At the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs. And plenty of people would love to be told. I should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids, just off the slopes, and into Johnny Knoxville.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who owns the company that had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves? from the following article ?  Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- The U.S. military in Japan has charged a Marine with rape and other violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in the alleged sexual assault of 14-year old girl in Okinawa. A civic group member protests against Hadnott near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo on February 13. Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, has been charged with the rape of a child under 16, abusive sexual contact with a child, making a false official statement, adultery and kidnapping, the Marines said Friday. No dates for the court-martial have been set. In February, Japanese authorities released Hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations against him, but the Marine Corps conducted its own investigation to see if Hadnott violated codes of military justice. It held him at a Marine facility. Two years ago, a","output":"similar incident involving U.S. military personnel in Okinawa spurred massive public outcry and calls for a reevaluation of the presence of American forces in Japan. The case intensified tensions between the local community and the U.S. military, with concerns over the conduct of servicemen stationed in the area. Critics argue that such incidents serve as a painful reminder of past misconduct by American troops, symbolizing larger issues surrounding the ongoing presence of U.S. bases in the country. The relationship between the U.S. and Japan remains strained, as the Japanese government has been attempting to balance maintaining its alliance with the U.S., while also addressing the growing concern from its citizens over the presence of military bases—particularly in densely populated areas. Protests have erupted in recent years over the continued presence of U.S. military bases on Japanese soil, and these concerns have only been heightened by incidents involving criminal behavior from U.S. military personnel. In response to the outrage following this recent case of alleged sexual assault, both Japanese and U.S. officials have called for a renewed focus on educational and prevention programs to minimize the risk of future incidents involving servicemen. Moreover, the U.S. government has promised to work with the Japanese government in tightening regulations and increasing oversight of its military personnel stationed in the country. Although no dates for the court-martial of Staff Sgt. Hadnott have been set, one can expect it to receive significant attention from both the Japanese and international media. Many will see the outcome of the case as an indicator of the U.S. military's commitment to preventing further crimes, in addition to the existing initiatives aimed at fostering goodwill and cooperation between the two nations. The continued presence of American forces in Japan has been a delicate topic for both countries for decades. While the U.S. government and military officials emphasize their commitment to maintaining security and their ongoing cooperation with the Japanese, cases such as the alleged assault committed by Staff Sgt. Hadnott underscore the need for a more substantial effort towards addressing the long-standing issue of U.S. military personnel misconduct in Japan. In the long term, it is crucial for both countries to work together to find a viable solution that will benefit their mutual interests while keeping their respective citizens safe and secure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. This task is about using the specified sentence and converting the sentence to Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets of the form (subject, predicate object). The RDF triplets generated must be such that the triplets accurately capture the structure and semantics of the input sentence. The input is a sentence and the output is a list of triplets of the form [subject, predicate, object] that capture the relationships present in the sentence. When a sentence has more than 1 RDF triplet possible, the output must contain all of them. Q: President Hamani Diori got a 6 for Political Rights and a 6 for Civil Liberties.

Background: Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. Context: In December 1998 Rouvas released his sixth album (the first with his new label): Kati Apo Mena (Something From Me), written by Giorgos Theofanous. \\"Den Ehi Sidera I Kardia Sou\\" (\\"Your Heart Doesn't Have Steel Rails\\") was a hit, and remains one of his most-popular songs. To promote the album Rouvas performed at the Virgin Megastore in Athens, where thousands of fans created a traffic jam. The next year, Rouvas records \\"Oso Exo Esena\\" (\\"As Long As I Have You\\"), a duet with singer Stelios Rokkos. The two artists work and perform together at Bio Bio in Athens during the summer.  In March 2000 Rouvas released his seventh album, 21os Akatallilos (21+ X-Rated), and performed with Katy Garbi at Pili Axiou in Thessaloniki. The album and its first single, \\"Andexa\\" (\\"I Held Out\\"), reached number one on the charts. During May rehearsals for summer performances Rouvas was hospitalized with abdominal pain, which was diagnosed as peritonitis and required an appendectomy. On 25 October 2000, he began appearing with Antonis Remos and Peggy Zina at Apollonas for the winter season. That year Rouvas became the Pepsi spokesperson for the company's Greek summer campaign making a first television ad, a first for a Greek entertainer. His collaboration with Pepsi continued into 2001, with a May television ad. The advertisement, featuring a semi-nude Rouvas holding a Pepsi bottle in front of his genitals, was controversial among women's rights and parental associations. Calling it \\"unsightly, vulgar and unacceptable\\", they tried to have the ad blocked as \\"disgrac[ing] childhood innocence and dignity.\\" The Pepsi Tour 2001, of seven Greek cities, followed.  During summer 2000 Rouvas, Psinakis and a number of other celebrities visited Mykonos on a yacht borrowed from a local physician. They were accused of drug possession, since the yacht contained narcotics. The incident was publicized amid speculation that Rouvas might have a drug addiction. Although the doctor admitted that the narcotics were his, his guests were questioned. Wishing to avoid court, Rouvas paid a fine and minimized the incident. However, thousands of T-shirts were printed which read: \\"Imoun ki ego sto kotero!\\" (\\"I was on the yacht, too!\\"). Question: what was the name of his new label?. Whats the answer?","output":"The text does not provide a specific name for Sakis Rouvas's new record label that he signed with in December 1998 for the release of his sixth album, \\"Kati Apo Mena\\" (Something From Me). It simply refers to it as his \\"new label\\". Given the prominence of the artist's career described in the text, this label would have been a notable entity in the Greek music industry, but without more information or context made available in the provided description, we cannot identify the specific name of the label. Additionally, artists typically transition between multiple record labels throughout their career depending on various circumstances such as changing music markets, personal relationships with label executives, or differing visions for the artists' creative direction. An identification of the specific music label would require further research or more detailed information about this stage in Sakis Rouvas's musical career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Atta and Shehhi\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who had their final conversation\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"Atta and Shehhi\\" correctly answers the question \\"Who had their final conversation?\\" based on the paragraph.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? is inside the article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\"., can you guess it ? A:","output":"A: The full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg is Reinhard Keiser."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

John and Dizzy live in the same apartment building, but they have never crossed paths despite sharing mutual friends.  Step 2: The Meet-cute One day after a long day at work, John takes a shortcut through a park as he walks home. Entranced by a captivating mural in-progress on a park wall, he finally meets its artist—Dizzy. The two strike up a conversation about their respective passions, finding themselves fascinated by each other's worlds. Step 3: Developing their friendship Dizzy and John start spending more time together as friends, collaborating on a project that combines both their interests: a mural illustrating residents' stories in a legal rights campaign. As they work together, they find camaraderie, inspiration, and support in their shared values. Step 4: The turning point Dizzy slowly falls in love with John as she discovers how compassionate, committed, and loyal he is toward his clients and friends. However, she hesitates because John’s all-consuming career leaves little room for personal relationships. Step 5: A potential roadblock A new high-profile case comes to John's attention, leaving him with even less time for Dizzy and threatening to derail their blossoming relationship. Dizzy, feeling neglected, seeks solace in her art and starts preparing for an exhibit. Step 6: The realization During the exhibit's opening night, John makes an appearance despite his overwhelming case responsibilities. As he admires Dizzy’s art, he sees a painting that powerfully encapsulates their shared moments and his own internal struggles. This realization ignites a newfound appreciation for the importance of love and relationships amidst his work in pursuing justice. Step 7: Overcoming barriers John decides to prioritize his personal life and make time for Dizzy. He finally confronts his feelings and expresses his love for Dizzy, who reciprocates his affection. Together, they navigate the balance of love, work, and art, inspiring each other to grow and flourish. Step 8: Happily ever after As the movie concludes, we see Dizzy and John living their lives in harmony, with John more open to love and Dizzy more grounded, both transforming each other's lives and working on projects that benefit the community.  The movie showcases a love that transcends barriers and explores the balance between career and personal life, leaving the audience touched and inspired by the magic of love found in unexpected places."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Einstein was displeased with quantum theory and mechanics (the very theory he helped create), despite its acceptance by other physicists, stating that God \\"is not playing at dice.\\" Einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory, and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76. In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.

Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car.

If you haven't already done so, create a plan for what to do in the event of a recession. This risk management plan should include a set of actions you plan to take in the event that you lose business or customers due to an economic downturn. After all, it will be easier to think of what to do before a recession that in the heat of the moment as your employees are panicking and unsure of what to do. Make sure to create concrete steps to follow and then transmit the plan to other managers or partners so that they can follow it as well. Your first course of action when hit by a recession should be to cut expenses where you can. This will help your business stay in operation while you work out a more permanent solution or until the economy recovers. Look around to reduce overhead costs like utilities, administration, and wasted materials. You can also reduce your inventory levels so that your assets aren't so tied up in product that may go unsold for months. If those don't work, consider:  Cutting your advertising spending. Pull out of traditional advertising like television and radio and instead focus on improving your social media presence. Doing so is free, even though it might take more of your time. Downsizing. Your other option to downsize. This can mean either reducing employees or moving to a cheaper location. Your remaining employees may have to work harder, but your business will at least be able to survive. If you do end up letting some employees go, you will need others to step into their roles. This is why it is important to cross-train your employees for various roles within the business. This is best if done before it is needed. You should focus all of your efforts on retaining regular customers and maintaining your relationships with them. Make sure that they know that their business is appreciated. In addition, keep your quality just as high as before, even it you've had to make other cuts around the business. A recession is also a good opportunity to evaluate your customers. You may have those customers who are not profitable to work with. A recession is the perfect time to sever these relationships and seek new ones. Many businesses turn to deals and sales when the recession is hurting them. However, doing so will only make it harder for customers to justify paying your regular prices when the recession is over. In addition, these lower prices can cut into much needed profits. The only exception is that you may want to offer one-time payment extensions or discounts to customers that are also having a hard time. Just be clear to them that you are only extending this service once.","output":"Create a risk management plan for potential recessions, detailing actions to take if business declines due to economic downturn. Share this plan with managers and partners. First, cut expenses where possible, such as reducing overhead costs and inventory levels. Consider cutting advertising spending and focusing on social media presence, or downsizing by reducing employees or relocating. Cross-train employees for multiple roles within the business. Prioritize retaining regular customers and maintaining relationships while maintaining quality. Use a recession as an opportunity to evaluate and sever unprofitable customer relationships. Avoid relying on deals and sales, but consider offering one-time payment extensions or discounts to struggling customers with clear communication about your support."},{"instruction":"Read the following conversation and answer the question.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \\"animal behavior\\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher. Question: The author's course is welcomed by the prisoners because   _  .

A:","output":"If a person decides they want to weigh less, there is no direct or significant indirect effect on the process of coastal erosion by ocean waves. Their personal decision and efforts to lose weight would not have any notable impact on the natural phenomena of wave energy, sediment movement, or erosion. The perturbation in this case is too small and unrelated, thus it would not influence the coastal erosion process in any meaningful way. Coastal erosion is driven by complex interaction of various natural factors, including wave energy, tidal action, geological properties of the coast, and climate change-related factors such as sea-level rise. This process is not dependent on everyday human activities such as personal change in weight. Any significant change to the erosion process would require a large-scale alteration in these natural factors, either through direct human intervention (e.g., building structures along coastlines or implementing coastal protection measures) or through complex global changes in climate and environmental conditions that influence the nature and intensity of ocean waves and sediment transport."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Tom Swift and His Motor Boat or The Rivals of Lake Carlopa is Volume 2 in the original Tom Swift novel series published by Grosset & Dunlap.

I will then provide a comprehensive response. Step 1: Identify the local currency After researching, I found that the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) is the local currency in Sri Lanka. Step 2: Check current exchange rates I would look up the current exchange rates for the user's currency to the Sri Lankan Rupee. The exchange rate is subject to change, so it is essential to check close to the travel date. Step 3: Consider exchanging currency before travel To avoid the hassle of finding a currency exchange point upon arrival, I'd suggest exchanging a small amount of cash to LKR before departing. This will be helpful for initial expenses like transportation or snacks. Step 4: Be aware of currency exchange rules and limits Sri Lanka has some restrictions on how much foreign currency can be brought into the country. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, a visitor can bring up to USD 15,000 or its equivalent without declaration. So, it's important to keep that in mind when planning the amount of money to carry. Step 5: Consider using credit or debit cards It's a good idea to check if your credit or debit card is accepted in Sri Lanka. Visa and MasterCard are widely accepted, and using cards can be more convenient than carrying cash. Moreover, the exchange rates offered by your card provider may be better than local currency exchange offices. However, I would recommend having some cash on hand due to not all businesses accepting card payments. Based on my research: The answer is: Take the local currency, Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), for your trip. Before traveling, exchange a small amount of money to LKR and consider carrying some USD or equivalent foreign currency within the allowed limit. Check the current exchange rates and use your credit or debit card where possible for payments, as it might offer better exchange rates."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Plot title: Night Watch Movie plot: Based on a play by Lucille Fletcher, Night Watch is a suspense thriller about a woman named Ellen Wheeler (Elizabeth Taylor), who one night, during a raging thunderstorm, frantically tells her husband John (Laurence Harvey) that from the living room window she has seen a murder being committed in the large old deserted house next door. John calls the police, but a search of the old house turns up nothing. The next morning, Ellen notices a freshly planted bed of flowers in the garden of the old house, that was not there before. She calls the investigating detective, Inspector Walker (Bill Dean), and suggests that the body of the murder victim she witnessed may be buried there. Inspector Walker then questions the caretaker of the old house, Mr. Appleby (Robert Lang), who confirms that he planted the flowers the night before during the storm, but refuses to let the police search the garden or dig up the flowers he just planted. Ellen is revealed to be recovering from a mental breakdown that occurred after her unfaithful first husband, Carl, was killed a few years earlier in an auto accident with his paramour. Ellen was traumatized by having to identify the bodies in the local morgue. Inspector Walker confides to John that Ellen may be mentally ill and suggests rest and a doctor. Ellen continues to maintain that she saw a murder in the deserted house, but there is no proof and John remains skeptical. Ellen's visiting friend Sarah Cooke (Billie Whitelaw) is equally skeptical and tries humoring Ellen by suggesting that she sees what she thinks she sees because of her recent breakdown. When both Ellen and Sarah see a man enter the old house the following night, they call the police, who find Mr. Appleby wandering around with a flashlight and arrest him for trespassing. A second search of the house and excavation of the garden reveal nothing, and Inspector Walker closes the case. John then brings over a psychiatrist friend of his, Tony (Tony Britton).

As such, their care and ownership come with many responsibilities. One crucial aspect of owning a pedigreed pet is managing the official documentation, particularly when transferring ownership from one individual to another. In this article, we will explore the role of pet registration certificates and pedigree associations in the ownership transfer process. Furthermore, we will discuss the necessary steps required to ensure this transition is seamless and legally sound. Importance of Pet Registration Certificates Registration certificates serve a crucial role in the world of pedigreed pets. These documents act as official records, representing the pet's ancestry, pedigree, and current legal owner. In essence, the certificate verifies that the pet is a genuine purebred specimen of its breed, allowing for reliable traceability of its lineage. The registration certificate also provides legitimacy and integrity, ensuring that the pet is protected from the illegal pet trade while also recognizing the breeders' commitment to responsible pet breeding and care. Pedigree Associations – Guardians of Breed Integrity Pedigree associations serve as the custodians of the breed’s heritage and pedigree data. Organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), and the American Bird Breeders Association (ABBA) maintain comprehensive breed and lineage records, allowing for the surveillance and enforcement of breed standards and ethical practices in pet breeding and ownership. These pedigree associations are not merely record-keepers; they take an active part in ensuring the welfare, recognition, and preservation of the breed. By maintaining a robust and verifiable record of purebred pets, pedigree associations help to protect the breed's unique characteristics and identities while combating unscrupulous breeding practices and unregulated pet sales. The Pet Ownership Transfer Process Transferring the ownership of a pedigreed pet involves a series of specific steps, both on the part of the current (old) owner and the new owner. This process helps to ensure that the chain of custody and legal responsibility for the pet moves smoothly from one party to another. Here is a detailed overview of these vital steps: 1. Locate the pet's registration certificate: Before starting the transfer process, the current owner must locate the pet's registration certificate. This document is essential for providing the pedigree association with an accurate record of the pet, its lineage, and the fact that it has been legally owned and registered. If the certificate is lost or misplaced, contact the pedigree association that issued the document to discuss the process for obtaining a duplicate or replacement. 2. Fill in the transfer information on the back of the certificate: After locating the pet's registration certificate, the current owner will need to complete the transfer section located on the back of the document. This part requires information about the new owner, such as their full name, address, and contact details. It is important to ensure that all of this information is correct and up-to-date to prevent any issues during the transfer process. 3. Sign the certificate as the old owner: As the current owner of the pedigreed pet, you must sign the transfer section of the registration certificate, indicating your intention to relinquish your legal ownership. This signature is a critical step in demonstrating your consent and confirming the accuracy of the provided information. It also helps to verify the authenticity of the document. 4. Mail the certificate to the pedigree association: After completing and signing the transfer section of the pet's registration certificate, the old owner should mail the document to the relevant pedigree association. The association will process the transfer request and update their records accordingly. After the transfer is completed, the pedigree association will issue a new registration certificate in the name of the new owner, thus establishing their legal ownership. Conclusion The transfer of pet ownership is an important part of ensuring the welfare and protection of pedigreed pets. By abiding by the process outlined in this article, pet owners can ensure a smooth and efficient ownership transfer while maintaining the integrity of the pet's lineage and breed. Remember, managing the official documentation is essential not just for the pet owner, but also for the breed and future generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the middle of the street, Nelson comforted Leslie because the dog belonging to","output":"In the middle of the street, Nelson comforted Leslie because the dog belonging to their elderly neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, had just been tragically hit by a passing car. As Leslie's eyes welled up with tears, Nelson instinctively wrapped his arms around her, attempting to provide solace in this heart-wrenching situation. They stood on the sidewalk, surrounded by other concerned neighbors who had rushed out of their houses upon hearing the terrifying screeching of the car tires and the sorrowful cries that followed. Mrs. Thompson's dog, a sweet and friendly Golden Retriever named Buddy, had been more than just a pet to the whole community; he was a symbol of hope and happiness that greeted everyone each morning with a wagging tail and boundless enthusiasm. Buddy had been instrumental in helping several children, including Leslie, overcome their fear of dogs after they had endured traumatic experiences with other animals. Over time, the whole neighborhood had come to love and cherish Buddy as if he were their own pet. As Leslie sobbed into Nelson's embrace, her thoughts turned to Mrs. Thompson, whose own tears mixed with the blood and dirt as she cradled the lifeless body of her beloved dog. Losing Buddy would be a tremendous blow to the fragile widow, who had found solace and companionship in her pet after her husband's passing a few years earlier. It was well known that Buddy had been a gift from her late husband, making the bond between the two even more profound and meaningful. Nelson, his heart aching for his friend and everyone who adored Buddy, felt a genuine sense of responsibility to offer comfort in this difficult time. He gently stroked Leslie's hair and whispered soothing words into her ear, assuring her that Buddy's life - though cut tragically short - had nonetheless been full of love, joy, and warmth. He reminded her that Buddy's indomitable spirit would live on not only in the hearts of those who cherished him, but in the happiness and courage he had instilled in so many people within the community. As they stood there amidst the quiet sobs of neighbors and the echo of the fading sirens, Nelson knew that this day would be etched in their memories forever, and yet he also knew something else; the community would rally together in the coming days to support Mrs. Thompson and hold one another a little closer, reminded of the transient nature of life. Together, they would honor Buddy's memory and continue the legacy of love and connection that the cherished dog had so effortlessly fostered during his time in their lives. And so, as the sun began to set on that somber day, Nelson continued to comfort Leslie in the middle of the street, the scent of freshly cut grass carried on the breeze, a reminder of the simpler days and shared happiness they had all experienced with the cherished dog that had simply been known as Buddy, the one who had belonged to their beloved Mrs. Thompson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"James Chadwick, a British physicist, is best known for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. Born on October 20, 1891, Chadwick was an extremely important figure in the field of atomic and nuclear physics. Before Chadwick's discovery, the atomic nucleus was thought to consist only of positively charged protons. However, the nuclear masses of most elements were observed to be nearly double the proton masses, which implied that there existed other subatomic particles in the atomic nucleus. In 1930, a German physicist named Walther Bothe observed an unusual form of radiation that was generated after bombarding the element beryllium with alpha particles (helium nuclei). These radiations did not produce the characteristic ionization effects predicted when existing forms of radiation, such as alpha, beta, and gamma rays, interacted with other elements. This raised the possibility that some other form of radiation or particle was being emitted. At the time, it was hypothesized that the observed radiation was a new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was dubbed \\"gamma rays.\\" Chadwick, however, was not convinced by this explanation. He began conducting a series of experiments to verify whether these observed radiations were a new form of electromagnetic radiation or a neutral, thus far undiscovered, subatomic particle. Chadwick used a variety of elements, including oxygen and carbon, as target materials and studied their interactions with the mysterious radiation. He observed that each of these substances emitted a stream of charged protons when they were struck by the mysterious radiation. This observation indicated that these radiations were composed of subatomic particles with a mass similar to that of protons but with no electric charge. To confirm the neutrality of these particles and also their mass, Chadwick performed a quantitative analysis. Collaborating with other researchers, he utilized additional elements, such as hydrogen, to calculate the mass of these new particles. After exhaustive analysis and numerous experimental data, he published his findings in a paper, where he introduced the neutron as the neutral, subatomic particle with a mass very close to that of protons. Chadwick's identification of the neutron revolutionized the field of nuclear physics and laid the foundation for many subsequent discoveries, such as nuclear fission, the atomic bomb, and nuclear power. Additionally, Chadwick's discovery significantly advanced our understanding of the atomic nucleus structure. The existence of neutrons, in combination with protons, could now explain the observed atomic masses of many elements. Moreover, the idea of isotopes – different forms of the same element with varying numbers of neutrons and the same number of protons – could now be fully comprehended through Chadwick's discovery.  In recognition of his valuable contribution to the field of science, James Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935. His discovery of the neutron and its properties remain crucial to the understanding of atomic and nuclear physics, further emphasizing the significance of his work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the leader who brought Armenians with the Mongols who returned to Jerusalem?  Without support from the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, particularly the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, and to some extent the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to disorganization in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on May 3, 1281, extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on July 16, 1281, and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.In September 1281 the Mongols returned, with 50,000 of their own troops, plus 30,000 others including Armenians under Leo III, Georgians, and 200 Knights Hospitaller from Marqab, who sent a contingent even though...

Possible A: tropical forests, dictionary, amazon basin, congo, tropical rain forest  Why is \\"amazon basin\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"Amazon Basin is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Context relevance: The question mentions that the sloth heard Portuguese being spoken nearby. Portuguese is the official language of Brazil, which is home to a large part of the Amazon Basin. Recognizing the connection between the language spoken and a location where it's commonly spoken, Amazon Basin becomes a practical answer to the question.   2. Sloth's habitat: Sloths are native to Central and South America, specifically in tropical rainforests. The Amazon Basin is a vast tropical rainforest region, making it a suitable habitat for sloths. 3. Plausibility of other options:    - Tropical forests: This option is quite general, and while it could be a possible answer, it doesn't provide a specific location. The Amazon Basin, being a more focused area, would align more closely with human common sense.    - Dictionary: This option isn't a geographical location and doesn't explain where the sloth was when it heard Portuguese, so it can be ruled out by common sense.    - Congo: While it is a tropical rainforest region, the Congo is located in Africa, where both sloths and Portuguese as a common language are not native. Therefore, this option can be ruled out by common sense.    - Tropical rain forest: This option, like \\"tropical forests,\\" is too general and does not provide context for the presence of Portuguese speakers. Given these factors and by eliminating other non-sensible options, we can deduce that \\"Amazon Basin\\" is the answer aligned with human common sense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My mother washed aluminum foil after she cooked in it, and then she reused it. She was the earliest recycle queen before people had a name for it. My father was no different. He preferred getting old shoes fixed to -buying new ones. Their  marriage was good and their dreams were focused .Their best friends lived just a wave away. Though my parents have passed away, I can see them now - Dad in trousers, a T-shirt and a hat and Mom in a house dress, lawnmower in one hand and dishtowel in the other. It was the time to fix things -a curtain rod ,the kitchen radio, the screen door, the oven door, and so on. They fixed all things we had. It was a way of life, and sometimes it made me crazy. All that re-fixing and renewing made me want to scream.1 wanted just once to be wasteful. Waste meant being rich. Throwing things away meant you knew there'd always be more. I often thought like that. But then my mother died, and on that clear summer night, in the warmth of the hospital room, I learned that sometimes there isn't any more. Sometimes, what we care about most gets all used up and goes away and it will never return. So, while we have it, it is the best that we love it, care for it, fix it when it's broken and cure it when it's sick.

Summarize the following: If you're looking to date around, an online dating site is a safer bet than regular social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  Here are a few you can consider:  Free sites: PlentyofFish, OkCupid Tastebuds.fm (based on taste in music), PassionsNetwork, DateHookup, Mamba (Russian-based). Paid sites: Match.com, eHarmony, True.com, Lavalife, Lovestruck (UK, Hong Kong and Singapore), Zoosk, Meetic. If finding a partner who shares your religion is important to you, consider:  Christians: ChristianMingle, ChristianCafe, RainbowChristians (LGBT) Catholics:  CatholicMatch Jews: JDate, SawYouAtSinai Mormons: LDSSingles, MormonDating, LDSplanet Muslims: Muslima, ShaadiConnections Buddhists: BuddhistConnect Seventh-day Adventists: Adventist Singles Connection Pagans: AonghusOg Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and others: ShaadiConnections. Atheists: FreeThinkerMatch  This is probably the most important step in the whole process.  Your profile is your first impression in the online dating world, and it can make or break whether potential partners are interested in you.  Consider these areas:  Your username.  Consider basing it in your initials, favorite number, or favorite hobby.  Avoid using words like \\"hot,\\" \\"sexy,\\" \\"daddy,\\" or any sexualized descriptor in your username — most women will read it as creepy. Choose a good profile picture. Your profile picture should follow three rules: it should be recent, provide a good look at your face, and make you seem approachable.  If you don't currently have a photo that fits this description, take a new one!  Bring along a camera next time you go to a social event, and ask a friend to take a quick snap of you. Avoid professional headshots.  They're too stilted for an online dating site, and you'll look like you're trying too hard.  Your bio.  Most websites will provide a short bio or \\"about me\\" section for you to fill in.  Don't write a novel, but do provide enough information that potential partners will feel like they're gaining a sense of who you are.  You can discuss your hobbies, your goals, what you look for in a relationship, any children you have, or whatever else defines you as a person. Resist the urge to vent about your previous relationship.  \\"Recently divorced from a lying, cheating harlot\\" reads as \\"bitter and angry\\" instead of \\"dateable and balanced.\\"  Your interests.  Some sites will have a separate area for you to list interests or hobbies.  Sports, musical genres or groups, crafts, historical periods, movie genres, types of food, travel destinations, and books are all appropriate topics for this part of your profile. Who you're interested in meeting.  Try not to be too restrictive on these parameters.  You never know — your soulmate might only be a year or two older than the top age you specify.  Keep your ranges broad, and remember that you're not obligated to date everyone who contacts you. If you're asked to describe in writing the type of girl you'd like to meet, this is the place to knock it out of the park.  Don't say \\"I just want someone to talk to\\" — no girl wants to be \\"just someone to talk to\\" when another man will call her a princess or the light of his life.  Talk up your future partner in the best terms you can muster.  For instance, you might try something like \\"I'm looking for the woman of my dreams, who will share my passion for cooking, cycling and honesty, and who will allow me to treat her like the queen she is.\\"  Your contact settings.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Suppose there is less damage by acid rain, meaning that the acidity levels in the water are not as high, and the absorption of aluminum from the soil is reduced. If this perturbation were to occur, it would have several possible effects (direct or indirect) on the process: 1. Direct effect: With less acidity and reduced amounts of aluminum, the immediate harm to fish, their eggs, frogs, and plants may be lessened. As a result, their populations could potentially stabilize or recover to a certain extent, thus preventing further decline in their numbers. 2. Indirect effect: A healthier aquatic ecosystem, due to less damage by acid rain, would positively impact the other wildlife that depends on it. Insects and other species that rely on the fish, frogs, and plants for their survival would also experience population stabilization or growth. 3. Indirect effect: A more balanced and healthier ecosystem could be more resilient to other environmental stressors, such as pollution and climate change. This increased resilience would help the ecosystem to better withstand any future instances of acid rain. 4. Indirect effect: If less damage from acid rain were to occur due to changes in human behavior or policies (e.g., reductions in pollution emissions), this could potentially contribute to a more significant improvement in ecosystem health, acting as a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less damage by acid rain would have both direct and indirect effects on the process, leading to a more balanced and healthier ecosystem.

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes?

The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for \\"interminable days\\" while the Putsch ran its course.

A conservative, he hosts the Glenn Beck Radio Program, a popular talk-radio show nationally syndicated on Premiere Radio Networks. Beck also hosts the Glenn Beck television program, which ran from January 2006 to October 2008 on HLN, from January 2009 to June 2011 on the Fox News Channel and currently airs on TheBlaze. Glenn Lee Beck was born in Everett, Washington, the son of Mary Clara (nee Janssen) and William Beck, who lived in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, at the time of their son's birth. The family later moved to Mount Vernon, Washington, where they owned and operated City Bakery in the downtown area. He is descended from German immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. Beck was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon.  Glenn and his older sister moved with their mother to Sumner, Washington, attending a Jesuit school in Puyallup. On May 15, 1979, while out on a small boat with a male companion, Beck's mother drowned just west of Tacoma, Washington, in Puget Sound. The man who had taken her out in the boat also drowned. A Tacoma police report stated that Mary Beck \\"appeared to be a classic drowning victim\\", but a Coast Guard investigator speculated that she could have intentionally jumped overboard. Beck has described his mother's death as a suicide in interviews during television and radio broadcasts.  After their mother's death, Beck and his older sister moved to their father's home in Bellingham, Washington, where Beck graduated from Sehome High School in June 1982. Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa. In the aftermath of his mother's death and subsequent suicide of his stepbrother, Beck has said he used \\"Dr. Jack Daniel's\\" to cope. At 18, following his high school graduation, Beck relocated to Provo, Utah, and worked at radio station KAYK.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.  I am facing a new situation today: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","output":"Given the information from the background article and the new situation, the correct answer is that the levels of carbon dioxide will likely increase if Illinois adds even more fossil fuel burning factories. The background article explains that burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. By increasing the number of factories in Illinois that rely on fossil fuels as their main energy source, more carbon dioxide will be released into the atmosphere. In contrast, the situation in Indiana where factories are replaced with parks containing numerous plants and trees is likely to have a different impact on carbon dioxide levels. Plants and trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, helping to convert it into oxygen as part of the carbon cycle. This reduces the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Thus, Indiana's actions could help mitigate some of the effects of carbon dioxide emissions. However, it may not be enough to counterbalance the increased emissions from the new factories in Illinois. In conclusion, if Illinois continues to add more fossil fuel burning factories, it will likely lead to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. This can contribute to global warming and climate change. Meanwhile, the efforts in Indiana to replace factories with parks and green spaces could provide some benefits to the environment, but the overall impact will still likely be an increase in carbon dioxide levels due to the additional emissions from Illinois."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"love may have been in the air onscreen\\" suggests that the film intended to depict love or romance, possibly within its storyline or character relationships. Despite this, the reviewer states that they \\"certainly [weren't] feeling any of it.\\" This indicates a disconnect between the intended emotions conveyed by the movie and the emotions experienced by the critic. The review doesn't provide specific details or feedback regarding the film's various aspects. However, the overall tone conveys disappointment, particularly in the ineffectiveness of the film's central theme or emotional core. The critic's lack of engagement with the intended emotional atmosphere can be interpreted as a critique of either the plot, the characters, the acting, the direction, or a combination of these elements.

Write a question about the following article: The Broncos' defense limited Titans' quarterback Marcus Mariota to only 88 yards passing on 6 of 20 attempts; however, the Titans controlled the first half time of possession by a 2-1 margin and led 10-0 in the first quarter. Running back DeMarco Murray rushed for a 1-yard touchdown and placekicker Ryan Succop kicked a 53-yard field goal; the latter scoring play occurred after the Titans' defense forced a fumble off Broncos' running back Justin Forsett. A 41-yard field goal by Succop just before halftime gave the Titans a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' offense did not cross midfield in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, the Broncos were attempting to cut into the Titans' lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Titans' defense stopped the Broncos on a 4th-and-goal. After forcing a Titans' punt, the Broncos finally got on the scoreboard with ten minutes remaining in the game, with quarterback Trevor Siemian connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. After forcing a three-and-out from the Titans, the Broncos marched down to as far as the Titans' 16-yard line, but had to settle on a 34-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus to narrow the Titans' lead to 13-10 with 4:33 remaining in the game.

American buildings of the Georgian period were very often constructed of wood with clapboards; even columns were made of timber, framed up, and turned on an over-sized lathe. At the start of the period the difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a common alternative only in the larger cities, or where they were obtainable locally. Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the College of William and Mary, offer leading examples of Georgian architecture in the Americas. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of architecture was sparsely scattered through the English colonies during the Georgian era","output":"The type of architecture that was widely spread through the English colonies during the Georgian era was, as suggested in your statement, Georgian architecture. Named after the ruling monarchs of the time, King George I, II, and III, Georgian architecture was characterized by its sense of proportion and balance, simplicity and grandeur.  Georgian architecture was popular from 1714 to 1830, and its influence was not only confined to England, it spread to its various colonies as well. In the English colonies of America, Georgian architecture played an important role and its influence can be seen in the designs of many historic buildings. Design elements of Georgian architecture included rigid symmetry in building mass as well as window and door placement. The design was based on the classical proportions of Roman and Greek architecture, and it often included elements such as columned porticos, pediments, and friezes.  The use of high-quality materials, like stone and brick, were ideal but they were problematic in terms of obtaining and transporting them in the colonies. For this reason, colonial Georgian buildings, such as those mentioned in your question like Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the College of William and Mary, often used locally available materials like wood. This twist gave rise to a more vernacular form of Georgian architecture, sometimes known as 'Colonial Georgian'.  In Colonial Georgian Architecture, even columns would sometimes be made of timber, framed up, and then turned on an oversized lathe. Clapboards were often used for constructing these buildings. This adoption of local materials gave the Georgian style a distinct flair in the colonies, making it both practical and aesthetically pleasing.  Therefore, it's safe to say, Georgian architecture was not \\"sparsely scattered\\" but rather extensively incorporated and adapted by the English colonies during the Georgian era. It remains a significant part of the architectural history of these regions, showcasing a harmonious blend of English design principles with local materials and construction techniques."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under? is inside the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The last name of the person under whose baton Monteux studied is Nikisch, as referenced in the text where it states \\"As an orchestral conductor he modeled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.\\" Arthur Nikisch was a celebrated Hungarian conductor, known for his dynamic and passionate conducting style."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"One of the four courts of last resort in France, that was established in 1790 under the name Tribunal de cassation is?\\"  Context: \\"France's highest courts are located in Paris.

After the consigliere (assistant) to the Mafia Don dies, crushed by a crate of tuna-fish cans, small-time hood George (David Proval) sees his chance to move up. Together with his dim-witted sidekick, Dip (Dan Moran), they celebrate with some prostitutes â George is ecstatic when treated to the oral talents of Glorice (Candis Cayne), the new girl on the docks. When they realize they've forgotten mob boss Joey \\"The Heart\\" Aorta's (Tony Sirico) birthday, George suggests a date with the beautiful Glorice. But the date doesn't go well, and Aorta ends up with plate of spaghetti on his head. Fortunately, Aorta likes Glorice's tough style, and George and Dip celebrate. Their festivities are cut short when they discover that Glorice is a transsexual woman. The two try introducing Aorta to other women, but none can match up to Glorice because, as Aorta says, \\"She's got balls\\". The Mafia Don even thanks George with a kiss, and George panics, thinking he's received the ominous \\"Kiss of Death\\". But his fear is unfounded as Aorta promotes George to consigliere and throws him a party with a cake made by Mickey the Baker (Gerry Cooney). As the assistant and new friend to the boss, George is forced to drive the two on a date which ends with Aorta on the receiving end of Glorice's oral talents. Aorta announces his engagement to Glorice with George to be best man, and the beautiful moll reveals to George her plan of blackmail. So George decides to hire hitman Briles (Jerry Grayson), an expert assassin. But he fails when Glorice recognizes the hitman as a long-lost uncle, and the hitman is unwilling to kill a nephew in a dress. George, dejected, walks the streets when he's suddenly tackled by a draft detective. George proves his undraftable 4-F status by showing his flat feet. Discovering Glorice in the draft detective's wanted file, George turns Glorice in to the Navy. When Glorice doesn't turn up at the wedding, Aorta cries on George's shoulder, believing Glorice left him at the altar.... The answer to this question is:","output":"The Mafia Don, Joey \\"The Heart\\" Aorta, thanked George by kissing him. Initially, George panicked, thinking he received the ominous 'Kiss of Death', a symbolic gesture in Mafia culture often used to indicate that a member of the family has been marked for death.

This promotion was received with a celebration that included a cake made by Mickey the Baker. The kiss, therefore, was not a death sentence but rather a gesture of gratitude and promotion. Later, Aorta also tasked George to be the best man for his engagement to Glorice.

Willard finds himself constantly humiliated in front of his co-workers by his cruel boss, Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), a vicious man who assumed control of the company from Willard's father upon his death, and whose professional interest in Willard extends to a personal financial one. A co-worker, Cathryn (Laura Elena Harring), has sympathy for the quirky Willard.[2] Cathryn becomes Willard's friend and love interest. Willard quickly becomes obsessed with his friendship with a rat he names Socrates. Willard then begins to train and befriend the other rats including an extra large one he calls Ben. Ben begins to assume a position of \\"leadership\\" among the other rats, while Socrates remains Willard's favorite. After he trains the rats sufficiently, Willard takes them to Martin's home, where he unleashed them to chew the tires on Martin's Mercedes. Willard's mother panics when she overhears the rats and later dies by falling down the stairs of the basement. Willard learns soon afterward that payments on the house have fallen far behind, and that the bank will likely foreclose upon the property. Willard then says that Socrates is all he has left. Cathryn stops by and gives Willard a house-trained cat named Sculley, he sets the cat inside and leaves. The rats, led by Ben, attack and kill Sculley. When Willard arrives home he notices Ben watching him evilly; Willard begins to distrust Ben thereafter. Desperately lonely, Willard begins to bring Socrates to work with him. Willard finds a note at his desk declaring that he's being fired by Frank Martin from the company his father founded.

Please answer the following question: Millions of stars are travelling about in space. A few form groups which travel together, but most of them travel alone. And they travel through a universe which is so large that one star seldom comes near to another. For the most important part each star makes its journey in complete loneliness, like a ship on an empty ocean. The ship will be well over a million miles from its nearest neighbour. From this it is easy to understand why a star seldom finds another anywhere near it. We believe, however, that some two thousand million years ago, another star wandering  through space, happened to come near our sun just as the sun and the moon raised its tides  on the earth, so this star must have raised tides on the surface of the sun. But they were very different from the small tides that are raised in our oceans; A large tidal  wave must have travelled over the surface of the sun, at last forming a mountain so high that we cannot imagine it. As the cause of the disturbance came nearer, so the mountain rose higher and higher. And before the star began to move away again, its tidal pull had become so powerful that this mountain was torn to pieces and thrown off small parts of itself into space. These small pieces have been going round the sun ever since. They are the planets. Some two thousand years ago, the mountain on the sun was raised probably because   _  . A) the star moved away from the sun B) another star happened to come near the sun C) the sun and the moon raised the tides on the earth D) a large tidal of wave travelled over the surface of the sun Answer:","output":"B) another star happened to come near the sun The formation of planets, as described in the question, is believed to have occurred around two thousand million years ago when another star happened to come near our sun. As the stars in the universe travel mostly alone and seldom come near each other, this event was quite remarkable. The gravitational pull between two massive celestial bodies, like the sun and the wandering star, resulted in strong tidal forces. Similar to how the sun and the moon interact with the Earth to create tides in our oceans, the nearby star raised tides on the surface of the sun. However, these tides were very different from the smaller tides raised in Earth's oceans. A large tidal wave swept across the sun's surface, eventually forming an enormous mountain beyond our imagination. The closeness of the wandering star meant that the tidal forces at play were strong enough to cause the mountain's immense growth. As the wandering star began to move away, its tidal pull reached its peak power, tearing the mountain apart and ejecting small pieces of itself into space. These fragments have been orbiting the sun ever since, forming the planets that are part of our solar system. In summary, it is believed that the mountain on the sun was raised primarily because another star happened to come near the sun (option B). This event led to the immense tidal forces that ultimately resulted in the formation of planets, shaping the solar system we know today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      EgyptAir hostesses line up during a candlelight vigil for the victims of EgyptAir flight 804 in Cairo, Egypt, Thursday, May 26, 2016. The cause of Thursday's crash of the EgyptAir jet flying from Paris to Cairo that killed all 66 people aboard still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt,... (Associated Press)      CAIRO (AP) — A French vessel that joined the search for the EgyptAir plane which crashed last week killing all 66 people on board arrived Friday in the crash area, as Egyptian officials said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the doomed aircraft.      According to Egyptian security officials, the French ship is carrying equipment that can find flight data and cockpit voice recorders — the so-called \\"black boxes.\\" French officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the ship's whereabouts.      Meanwhile, the chief investigator in Egypt said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the EgyptAir Flight 804. Locating a beacon has narrowed the search to a 5 kilometer (3 mile) radius, said Ayman al-Moqadem, stressing that this doesn't mean the black boxes have been found, which he said requires highly sophisticated technology.      The signal that was picked up came from one of the devices on the plane transmitting its location, said al-Moqadem, who spoke to reporters on Thursday.      Eight days after the plane crashed off Egypt's northern coast on a Paris to Cairo flight, the cause of the tragedy still has not been determined. Ships and planes from Egypt, Greece, France, the United States and other nations have been searching the Mediterranean north of the Egyptian port of Alexandria for the jet's voice and flight data recorders, as well as more bodies and parts of the aircraft.      Small pieces of the wreckage and human remains have already been recovered while the bulk of the plane and the bodies of the passengers are believed to be deep under the sea. A Cairo forensic team has received the human remains and is carrying DNA tests to identify the victims.      Egypt's civil aviation minister Sherif Fathi has said he believes terrorism is a more likely explanation than equipment failure or some other catastrophic event. But no hard evidence has emerged on the cause, and no militant group has claimed to have downed the jet. Earlier, leaked flight data indicated a sensor detected smoke in a lavatory and a fault in two of the plane's cockpit windows in the final moments of the flight.      The French air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said in a statement that the Laplace ship left Thursday from Corsica for the zone of the crash, with two BEA investigators aboard. The Laplace is equipped with three detectors made by the Alseamar company designed to detect and localize signals from the flight recorders, believed about 3,000 meters (3,280 yards) underwater.      France may also send an unmanned submarine and deep-sea retrieval equipment, the statement said. The BEA is involved in the search because the crashed plane was an Airbus, manufactured in France.      Because of the difficulties in finding the black boxes, Egypt has contracted two foreign companies to help locate the flight data recorders of the plane.      One of the companies is Alseamar, which has equipment aboard the French vessel. Egyptian official have said the second company is called Deep Ocean Search. Also, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said earlier that a submarine would join the search for the plane's data recorders.      However, al-Moqadem told reporters that the submarine is not equipped to detect signals from the black boxes.      All Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. ||||| Image copyright Egyptian Military/Reuters Image caption Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea north of the Egyptian coast      A French naval ship specialising in underwater searches is on its way to help find the flight recorders of an EgyptAir plane that crashed last week.      On Thursday, Egypt's chief investigator said the search had narrowed to about 5km (3.1 miles) in the Mediterranean.      This was based on a signal from the plane's emergency beacon, but officials now say the signal was received on the day of the crash and is not new.      There were 66 people on board when the Airbus A320 crashed on 19 May.      The plane was flying overnight from Paris to Cairo when it vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call.      France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, confirmed a naval oceanographic research ship, Laplace, is heading for the crash site.      In a statement, it said the ship was due to reach the crash area on Sunday or Monday, carrying a long-range acoustic system able to detect signals from the black box.      Image copyright AP Image caption Hundreds of people gathered in Cairo for a candlelit vigil for the victims on Thursday      Egypt's chief investigator, Ayman al-Moqadem, had said on Thursday that a signal detected was from a beacon situated in the rear of the cabin on the plane which transmits its location.      However, other officials on Friday told journalists that the signal was received on the day of the crash, and that there had been no other signals since.      \\"There has been nothing since day one,\\" one official close to the investigation told Reuters.      On Thursday, hundreds of people gathered in Cairo for a candlelit vigil for the victims of the crash.      Among those on board MS804 were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.      They included a boy and two babies as well as seven crew and three security staff.      Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.      Media caption BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott looks at the possible meaning of EgyptAir's smoke alerts      Egypt's president has said that \\"all scenarios are possible\\", but Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathy said last Friday that a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure.      Greece's defence minister said last week that, after leaving Greek airspace and before it disappeared from Greek radar, the plane abruptly turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000 ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft).      The Aviation Herald also reported that the plane sent a series of warnings indicating that smoke had been detected on board three minutes before it disappeared.      However, an Egyptian aviation official denied the plane had deviated from its route, and that there had been reports of smoke.      Sources from Egypt's investigation team told Reuters and Associated Press on Friday that no emergency signals had been detected from the plane since the day it disappeared. Such signals are too weak to transmit from underwater, although signals from the flight recorders may yet be detected. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A special French vessel has arrived in the search area where the EgyptAir plane crashed last week, which killed all 66 people on board.

A retired Marine with nearly two decades of aviation experience has stepped forward with a compelling theory about a mysterious plane that was spotted flying over Texas last month. On March 10, photographers Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett took pictures of three puzzling aircraft flying over Amarillo, and posted them online in hopes of identifying the planes. Retired-Marine James Vineyard has submitted one of the more interesting explanations, telling the Houston Chronicle he believes they are SR-72 Blackbirds - a spy plane that can cross the U.S. in less than an hour, unmanned. The triangle over Texas: Two photographers captured this mysterious object flying over Texas last month. Mystery solved? A retired Marine says the plane pictured in Amarillo last month is the SR-72 Blackbird - a plane designed to cross the country in less than an hour. The mystery aircraft  seen over Amarillo on March 10. Three of the craft were spotted flying by. In 1956, British magazines started. getting eyewitness accounts and grainy photos of the Lockheed U-2, then. operating out of RAF Lakenheath on its first spy flights over the Soviet. Union - marking the first sight of a stealth plane that government's. had hoped to keep secret from prying eyes. It provided day and night, very high-altitude (70,000 feet / 21,000 m), all-weather intelligence gathering. Vineyard spent 17 years as a Marine and also worked with a jet squadron in Arizona. He. says the Pentagon may have dispatched the planes to the Indian Ocean to. aide in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. But Douglass, who saw the planes himself, doesn't agree. 'The. SR-72 is still in development,' he said Tuesday. 'Plus it's a. high-speed, high-Mach plane. These were going airliner speed. They were. not in a hurry to get anywhere.' The. SR-72 is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California,. and according to the company's website they say the plane could be. operational as early as 2030. It. is the predecessor of the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew. from New York to Lonton in less than two hours in 1976. Lockheed. Martin's Hypersonics program manager Brad Leland wrote that the plane. is designed to 'strike at nearly any location across a continent in less. than an hour.' 'Speed is. the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next. several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater,. similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today,' Leland said. Another source told the Chronicle that the plane was a B-2, but the two photographers discovered that no B-2s were flying in the country that day. The SR-72 is a successor to the SR-71 which broke speed records when it flew from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976. Another. reader who wished not to be identified told the Chronicle with. confidence that 'It's a B-2 stealth bomber flying out of Whiteman Air. Force Base in Missouri.' That's. what the photographers thought when they first saw the group of. aircraft, but they say they checked with the base and no B-2s were. flying anywhere in the U.S. that day. Instead,. Douglass believes that the planes are a no type of spy plane - a. stealth transport plane that could sneak troops into a another country. unseen.","output":"This article recounts an incident in which three puzzling aircraft were sighted flying over Amarillo, Texas, and photographed by Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett. The key highlights from the article include: 1. The Photographers' Observations: On March 10, Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett captured images of three mysterious aircraft over Amarillo, Texas, which they later shared online, hoping to identify the unfamiliar planes.  2. The Marine's Theory: Retired Marine James Vineyard, who possesses nearly two decades of aviation experience, posited that the aircraft in question were SR-72 Blackbirds - unmanned spy planes that can cross the U.S. within an hour. This theory was shared with the Houston Chronicle. Vineyard drew upon his 17 years as a Marine and his time working with a jet squadron in Arizona to form his hypothesis. He suggested that the Pentagon may have dispatched these planes towards the Indian Ocean to assist in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370. 3. The SR-72 Blackbird: The SR-72 Blackbird is the successor to the SR-71, which set speed records by flying from New York to London in less than two hours in 1976. Currently being developed by Lockheed Martin in California, the SR-72 could potentially be operational as early as 2030. According to Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's Hypersonics program manager, the plane is designed to strike at nearly any location across any given continent in less than an hour. 4. Contesting Theories: Despite Vineyard's theory, Douglass disagreed, stating that the SR-72 is still under development and hence could not have been in operation. Douglass argued that the airplanes were moving at airliner speed, not the high-speed associated with SR-72s. Another reader suggested that it might be a B-2 stealth bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri; however, the photographers debunked this theory after confirming that no B-2s were in flight anywhere in the U.S. on that day. 5. Douglass's Alternate Theory: Douglass hypothesizes that the spotted aircraft may be a new type of stealth transport plane, designed to covertly transport troops into foreign territories undetected. This theory, while unconfirmed, offers another perspective on the identity of the aircraft.  In conclusion, this article presents a real-life mystery of unidentified aircraft, with several theories attempting to explain their origin and purpose, with the truth remaining elusive."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in Persian.

Q: Question: How long is the river in San Antonio where Jones drove cotton carrying wagon along the river? Passage:Walter \\"Wiley\\" Jones was born in Madison County in northeastern Georgia, on July 14, 1848. His parents were George Jones, a white planter, and Jones' slave, Anne, who had six children by George Jones: Matthew (who superintended the construction of the Wiley Jones Street Car Line), Thomas, Julia (wife of Ben Reed), Wiley, Taylor, and James (who managed many of Wiley's businesses). Wiley received his nickname because of his mischievous nature. At the age of five, he moved to Arkansas with his master and more than forty fellow slaves. They settled on the Governor Byrd plantation. George Jones died in 1858. Anne was called his wife in an 1889 biography of Jones, and she believed that George had promised to free herself and her children upon his death, but no manumission papers were found, and the family was kept as slaves and sold by the estate administer, Peter Finerty, to James Yell, a lawyer and planter in Pine Bluff. Jones worked as a houseboy and carriage driver for his new master. When Jones was ten, he was given to Yell's only son, Fountain Pitts Yell, on the occasion of Pitts Yell's marriage. Pitts was a state representative from 1860 to 1861. During the American Civil War, James Yell became a Major General of the Arkansas State Militia, and Pitts became a colonel in Company S of the 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment in the Confederate Army. James Yell's was transferred to the Confederate States Army in the summer of 1861, and James left the service and moved to Texas. Jones served for Pitts during the war until Pitts' death in 1864 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill in Louisiana. Jones then joined James Yell and his family in Waco, Texas. There, he served as a porter in a mercantile house for one year. He was then hired to drive a wagon carrying cotton on a route along the Brazos River to San Antonio.  Links: a.

NFL Roundtable: Divisional playoff recap This edition of CBCSports.ca's NFL chatter covers the rise of Colin Kaepernick, the fall of the Broncos, and a look ahead to the conference title games. Follow our panelists on Twitter: Both. The Ravens' offence stole it from the Broncos' defence, who blew it. was all but over with Baltimore trailing by seven with less than a minute left in regulation and facing 3rd-and-3 at its own 30. Then Joe Flacco somehow completes a de facto Hail Mary to Jacoby Jones to send it to overtime, with the Broncos' secondary somehow letting Jones get behind them and somehow failing to bat the ball down in almost comical fashion. Run that play 100 times and I bet Baltimore scores a TD on maybe one or two of them. Broncos coach John Fox and safety Rahim Moore have a lot of explaining to do this week, but I'm going to give most of the credit to the Ravens' defence. Remember, this unit only allowed 21 points -- the other two touchdowns were due to special teams meltdowns. The key was the amount of pressure the Ravens put on Peyton Manning, specifically up the middle. It was similar pressure that flushed Manning outside the pocket before he attempted the ill-advised, cross-body interception in overtime. The Broncos also had three possessions in the two OT periods, but they never crossed midfield once. Baltimore defensive co-ordinator Dean Pees certainly earned his pay in this one. I'm leaning towards a steal here. Talk about a tough day for Champ Bailey in the secondary. One of the league's best at the cornerback position and he struggled immensely on Saturday. The Broncos had the chance to put this game away but they kept allowing Baltimore to stick around. But the shortcomings for Denver weren't all on defence. Late in the first overtime, Manning made the huge mistake of throwing across his body and his intended pass for Brandon Stokley up the middle ended up in the arms of corner back Corey Graham. That essentially sealed the deal right there. Kaepernick is getting all the press (deservedly so after that ) but the 49ers were a Super Bowl contender before their win over Green Bay, so I don't think this should change their status that much. The public seems to disagree: San Francisco is a 4.5-point favourite (already bet up from the opening line of 3) for the NFC title game at Atlanta. That's quite the swing from the divisional weekend, where Seattle (a team I consider roughly equal in quality to San Fran) was a 2.5-point underdog at Atlanta. I wonder if the public is crowning Kaepernick and the Niners a little too quickly. I agree, Jesse. The 49ers were Super Bowl contenders before Kaepernick even took the job from poor Alex Smith, mostly due to that suffocating defence. What Kaepernick adds is a duel threat that takes the burden off a receiving unit which relies too heavily on Michael Crabtree. It seems every week Crabtree catches at least six more balls than Randy Moss or Vernon Davis. If Kaepernick can continue to strike the right balance of passing and running, the 49ers should beat the Falcons on Sunday. Heck, if they play like they did against the Packers, they'll win it all. Sky's the limit I suppose. Kaepernick can run and now there is no doubt that he is the No. 1 guy under centre in San Francisco. Dom Capers and his Green Bay defence had no answer on Saturday night. None. Kaepernick can run the ball and throw it, especially to Crabtree, who had nine receptions, including a pair of touchdown catches. That said, he can still be erratic in the passing department and for that reason, I'm not ready to give the 49ers the NFC crown just yet. That's the narrative, but if Matt Bryant misses his go-ahead field goal try with seconds left (which he initially did, only to get another chance because Seattle's Pete Carroll did that annoying coaching move of calling a timeout just before the snap in a futile attempt to \\"ice\\" Bryant), then we're talking about the Falcons as playoff \\"chokers\\" who \\"can't win the big one.\\" Just shows you how thin a line NFL teams walk , especially in the playoffs. with the help of Carroll. Wow, when will coaches learn? I'm still not sold on this team. I see a lot of soft coverage over the middle, an area the 49ers should exploit. This game will come down to how well QB Matt Ryan can handle the extra passing load because I don't anticipate Michael Turner or Jacquizz Rodgers doing anything significant on the ground. It's a definite possibility. Once the Seahawks went ahead, we all had the \\"playoff choker\\" label painted all over the Georgia Dome. However, Ryan showed some poise on that final drive after making a couple of very questionable passes earlier in the fourth quarter. Yes, they blew a 20-0 lead at halftime, but they recovered and got the win. That momentum will carry into this Sunday when the 49ers come into town. Atlanta's pass defence has to be better, though. They gave up way too many yards in that department. Seattle's Zach Miller and Golden Tate combined for 14 catches and 245 yards. The probable return of John Abraham should help the Falcons' pass rush. I want to say it's big, but the Patriots just with Gronk out for most of the game, and I think they can take care of Baltimore without him. Much was made heading into this season about New England's unique two-tight-end offence, with the super-athletic Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez creating all kinds of matchup problems for opponents. That lasted about a week, with Hernandez going down with an injury and not returning until Gronk was out of the lineup (save for a two-game stretch in October where Hernandez tried to play but did not seem healthy). Still, the Patriots once again figured out a way to field one of the league's best offences, with an improved running game compensating for the injuries to the tight ends. As if we needed another reason to praise Bill Belichick, the NFL's best head coach showed us once again how good he is at adjusting on the fly. On any other team I'd say it's huge. However, New England has so many weapons that it's the one club which can recover from a devastating injury to one of the NFL's premier offensive talents. Don't get me wrong, who's amassed 39 touchdowns in three years is big, especially in the red zone. But with pass catchers Hernandez, Wes Welker and Brandon Lloyd -- and throw in running backs Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen while your at it -- in the fold, there are no shortage of targets for Tom Brady play with. That's the beauty of Belichick: he doesn't rely on one guy to carry the burden. As long as No. 12 is under centre, the Patriots can win in any fashion. With all due respect to Gronk, it's not an enormous loss. Hernandez is fully capable of stepping up. He caught six of Brady's passes for 85 yards on Sunday. Hernandez filled the void in the regular season and he'll be able to do it again. New England can more than compensate as far as receiving targets go with Welker, Lloyd and Vereen, who has become more versatile in the backfield. He had five catches and two receiving touchdowns to go along with a rushing TD on Sunday. It's been an impressive ride for Ray Lewis and the Ravens given their injuries, but their season will likely end at Foxborough in the AFC championship game for a second straight year. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In this NFL roundtable discussion, panelists recap the divisional playoff games, discussing Colin Kaepernick's rise, the Broncos' fall, and predict the outcomes for the conference title games.

Given the question: Information:  - Air Chief Marshal Sir David George Evans GCB , CBE ( born 14 July 1924 ) is a retired senior commander of the Royal Air Force .  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - Air chief marshal (Air Chf Mshl or ACM) is a four-star air officer rank which originated in and continues to be used by the Royal Air Force, where it is the most senior peacetime air force rank. The rank is also used by the air forces of many countries that have historical British influence and it is sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure. Air chief marshal is a four-star air officer rank and has a NATO ranking code of OF-9. An air chief marshal is equivalent to an admiral in the Royal Navy or a General in the British Army or the Royal Marines. In other forces, such as the United States Armed Forces and the Canadian Armed Forces, the equivalent four-star rank is General.  - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria  hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance  was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved.

But it's not always the length of the wait we find so unbearable. Some people camp outside Apple stores for an entire night just to get their hands on the latest product. But waiting 10 minutes in a grocery store just to buy a drink? Forget it. Our behavior when waiting is only partly decided by the length of the wait. \\"Often the psychology of queuing is more important than the statistics of the wait itself,\\" notes the MIT researcher Richard Larson. One apparent aspect of queuing psychology is that we get bored when we wait in line. This issue is solved in many ways, from magazines in hospital waiting rooms to mirrors in elevators so that we can check our appearance. We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one. But studies show that we are much more patient when we are given an idea of how long we'll be waiting. Walt Disney Co knows this better than anyone else. It posts estimated waiting times for attractions in its theme parks. But according to Larson, these times are overestimated so that visitors get to the front of the queue more quickly than they expect. It keeps them happy. But perhaps the biggest influence on our feelings about waiting in a line has to do with our sense of fairness.

Step 2: Analyzing the options a) four: This would decrease the total number of birds in a flock to less than five, which is not what the sentence suggests. b) zero: This option makes no sense, as it would mean there are no birds in the flock. c) eight: This would increase the total number of birds in a flock to thirteen (5+8), which could be a reasonable number for a small flock. d) six: This would increase the total number of birds in a flock to eleven (5+6), which could also be a reasonable number for a small flock. Step 3: Comparing the options While both c) eight and d) six provide reasonable numbers for the size of the flock, the smaller number in option d) seems more fitting for a \\"small flock.\\" Step 4: Selecting the best answer So, the best answer choice is d) six."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following context:  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose biographer was Michael Kennedy?

Possible A: desk, grocery shop, house, antique store, discount store  Why is \\"discount store\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The \\"discount store\\" as the answer to the question \\"Where do you buy a cheap book?\\" aligns with human common sense because a discount store typically sells goods at prices lower than those asked by traditional retail outlets. This correlation is primarily due to several factors including bulk buying, few replenishments, simplistic interiors, lack of advertising, and carrying overstock, discontinued, and irregular items. When considering the other options provided: desk, grocery shop, house, and an antique store, none are ideal places to find a cheap book in the traditional sense. 1. A desk is associated more with a piece of furniture and not a store or a place where books are sold. 2. A grocery shop primarily sells food and household items. While a few grocery stores may carry books, they are not traditionally known for it, and often the selection of books is quite limited, and the prices might not be regularly discounted. 3. A house is a dwelling place for living. While it may contain books, it’s not a commercial place where you can generally buy books. 4. An antique store refers to a retail store specializing in the selling of antiques, or the old and rare items. Books found in antique stores are often collectibles or rare editions, which are likely to be priced higher instead of cheaper. On the contrary, discount stores focus on offering a variety of products including books at reduced prices. Often, these discount stores carry bulk purchases or overstock items from other retailers or publishers that need to sell off excess inventory, translating into lower prices and discounts for the consumer. Therefore, consumers looking to buy cheap books would naturally lean more towards a discount store, thus aligning this choice with human common sense. The main driving factor here is the implied pricing strategy of the retail outlet in question, making a \\"discount store\\" the most logical choice for buying a cheap book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

Movie title: Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Movie plot: At the Burpelson U.S. Air Force Base somewhere in the continental USA, the eccentric Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders the 34 nuclear-armed B-52's of the 843rd Bomb Wing past their failsafe points where they normally hold awaiting possible orders to proceed and into Soviet airspace. He also tells the personnel on the base that the US and the USSR have entered into a \\"shooting war\\".In the \\"War Room\\" at The Pentagon, Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) about the attack that General Ripper ordered. Although a nuclear attack should require Presidential authority to be initiated, Ripper used \\"Plan R\\", an emergency war plan enabling a senior officer to launch a retaliation strike against the Soviets if everyone in the normal chain of command, including the President, has been killed during a sneak attack. Plan R was intended to discourage the Soviets from launching a decapitation strike against the President in Washington to disrupt U.S. command and control and stop an American nuclear counterattack. Turgidson tries to convince Muffley to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the Soviets as a threat by launching a full-scale attack. Turgidson believes that the United States is in a superior strategic position, and a first strike against the Soviet Union would destroy 90% of their missiles before they could retaliate, resulting in a victory for the U.S. with \\"acceptable\\" American casualties of \\"no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops... depending on the breaks\\". He is rebuked when Muffley instead admits the Soviet Ambassador (Peter Bull) to the War Room, contacts Soviet Premier Dmitri Kissoff on the hotline, and insists on giving the Soviets all the information necessary to shoot down the American planes before they can carry out their strikes.Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (also played by Peter Sellers), an RAF exchange officer serving as General Ripper's executive officer, realizes that there has been no attack on the...

Information:  - Nigel Olsson (born 10 February 1949) is an English rock drummer, and singer best known for his long-time affiliation with Elton John.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The Wurlitzer electric piano, trademarked the \\"Electronic Piano\\" and referred to by musicians as the \\"Wurly\\", was one of a series of electromechanical stringless pianos manufactured and marketed by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Corinth, Mississippi, U.S. and North Tonawanda, New York. The earliest models were made in 1954 and the last model was made in 1984. Since then the Wurlitzer electric piano sound has been recreated on digital keyboards, and the vintage models are sought by musicians and collectors.  - Supertramp (known as Daddy in 196970) are an English rock band formed in London in 1969. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of founders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone.  - Richard \\"Rick\\" Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as the founder, vocalist and keyboardist of progressive rock band Supertramp. Davies is the only member of Supertramp to have been with the group for their entire history, and has composed some of their most well-known songs, including \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"My Kind of Lady\\", and \\"Cannonball\\". He is generally noted for his sophisticated blues and jazz-influenced progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics.  - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz.  - Keith Baker ( born 14 April 1948 ) is a drummer , best known for a brief stint with Uriah Heep . He played for Bakerloo , but left the group following the release of its only album . He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp ( then called Daddy ) between late 1969 and early 1970 . Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury , replacing Nigel Olsson . He recorded the album with the group , but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clarke .  - Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp.  - Sir Elton Hercules John, (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 \\"Billboard\\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (19702000) he had at least one song in the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100. His tribute single, re-penned in dedication to the late Princess Diana, \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

Today, we're going to learn how to play your favorite games without using the actual game disc. Instead, we'll use some cool computer tools called \\"imaging software\\" and \\"virtual drive.\\" Don't worry – I'll explain everything step-by-step, so it's easy for you to understand. Let's get started! Step 1: Choose Your Tools – Imaging and Virtual Drive Software To begin, you'll need to get two special computer tools: \\"imaging software\\" and \\"virtual drive software.\\" These tools help your computer pretend it has the game disc, even when you don't actually put it in the computer. You can find many of these tools online, and some of them are totally free! You can ask your parents or older siblings to help you find and install the right ones for your computer. Step 2: Get Your Game Ready for Imaging First things first – we need to create a copy of your game so that it can be used with the virtual drive. To do this, put your game disc into your computer, and then open the imaging software. This software will help you make an exact copy or \\"image\\" of your game. Make sure you save this image in a special folder, so you don't lose it. Step 3: Set Your Disc Image Preferences Now that you have your game disc image, you'll need to set up some preferences in the software. Don't worry – it's easy! Look for options like \\"image format\\" or \\"image type,\\" and choose the right one for your game. Some popular formats are \\".ISO\\" and \\".BIN,\\" but you can usually just stick with whatever the software suggests. Step 4: Set Up the Virtual Drive Next, it's time to set up your virtual drive. This is the pretend game disc drive that your computer will use. Open your virtual drive software, and look for options like \\"create virtual drive\\" or \\"add virtual drive.\\" You might need to choose how many virtual drives you want – just pick one for now. That's all you need to set up your virtual drive! Step 5: Mount Your Disc Image to the Virtual Drive Now that you have your virtual drive, it's time to put your game disc image on it. This process is called \\"mounting.\\" In your virtual drive software, look for an option that says \\"mount\\" or \\"attach image\\" and then find the game disc image you saved earlier. Click on it, and it should \\"mount\\" to your virtual drive, just like if you put a real disc into a real drive. Step 6: Play Your Game! You did it, little gamer! Now, all that's left is to play your game – without needing the actual disc. Go to your computer's game folder and find the game you just mounted. Double-click on it, and your game should start right up! You can play and enjoy your game just like you always do, and when you're done, simply \\"unmount\\" the game image from your virtual drive. And there you have it! You've learned how to use imaging and virtual drive software to play your games without the need for discs. Now you can keep your game collection safe and scratch-free while enjoying your favorite games. Have fun, and happy gaming, little buddy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Greatest amount of alcohol imagery is between 8 and 9pm. Alcohol Concern call for appointment of alcohol advertising regulator. ITV and BBC both say they use fictitious brands in their shows.","output":"Title: The Impact of Alcohol Imagery in Prime Time Television and the Need for an Advertising Regulator Introduction Prime time television, typically from 8 pm to 11 pm, has long been a critical time for television channels to gain viewership. As a result, the content presented during these hours dramatically shapes public opinion and viewers' habits. One recurring theme in prime time television is the prevalence of alcohol imagery, which appears every nine minutes on terrestrial channels. This tendency sparks concerns and raises the question of whether an advertising regulator for alcohol should be appointed to minimize its potential negative consequences on society. In this article, we delve into the frequency of alcohol encounters on TV, the potential risks it poses, and the possible solution of implementing an alcohol advertising regulator. Frequency of Alcohol Imagery in Prime Time Television Recent research reveals that alcohol imagery is a dominant theme, particularly between 8 and 9 pm. The portrayal of alcohol during this time often appears in the form of advertisements, characters consuming alcoholic drinks, or having alcohol present in various scenes. Both ITV and BBC have mentioned that they use fictitious brands in their shows to portray alcohol consumption. However, this does not change the fact that the subject of alcohol remains prevalent, inevitably influencing viewers' perception of alcoholic beverages. Potential Risks Posed by Pervasive Alcohol Imagery The prominent display of alcohol in prime time television can lead to the normalization of drinking habits among viewers and, specifically, young and impressionable audiences. Consequently, it may perpetuate a culture of excessive drinking, leading to numerous health risks such as liver disease, addiction, and mental health issues. Furthermore, the glamorization of alcohol in TV shows could trigger individuals struggling with alcohol use disorder, making it increasingly difficult for them to overcome their addiction. Apart from health risks, excessive exposure to alcohol imagery on television may also impact viewers' social behavior. Drinking behaviors presented on television often include partying, building social connections, and unwinding after a long day. The fact that these associations are not inherently negative may contribute to people perceiving alcohol consumption as a widely accepted and expected cultural norm. This view could potentially undermine ongoing efforts to address alcohol-related risks and hinder public health campaigns to promote responsible drinking. The Need for an Alcohol Advertising Regulator Due to the pervasiveness of alcohol imagery on prime time television and its potential adverse effects on society, it is crucial that an alcohol advertising regulator be appointed to ensure responsible practices. Entities like Alcohol Concern have already called for the appointment of such a regulator, which would serve to protect viewers by providing guidelines, monitoring compliance, and imposing penalties in cases of infringement.  An advertising regulator could impose restrictions on the frequency and timing of alcohol advertisements, ensuring that they only appear during late-night programming or on channels with predominantly adult viewership. The regulator could also enforce content requirements, such as avoiding glamorization or excessive alcohol consumption and including messages promoting responsible drinking in advertising materials. Additionally, the regulator would also oversee the portrayal of alcohol in scripted TV shows, ensuring that the use of alcohol is justified by the plot and does not inadvertently promote harmful drinking behaviors. Conclusion The high frequency of alcohol imagery on prime time television raises concerns about its potential impact on viewers' attitudes and behaviors towards alcohol consumption. With alcohol use disorder and its related problems remaining pressing public health concerns, it is essential to implement strong regulations that address the portrayal of alcohol on television. The appointment of an alcohol advertising regulator offers a viable solution, fostering a responsible approach to the portrayal of alcohol and promoting a more mindful society in terms of alcohol consumption."},{"instruction":"Teacher:Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.

Question: Who does Roderick meet for dinner? Movie title: Sex and Death 101 Movie plot: Roderick Blank (Simon Baker) is a successful young businessman with a great job as an executive for \\"Swallows\\", a high end fast food restaurant chain, and a beautiful fiancÃ©e, Fiona Wormwood (Julie Bowen). On the day of his bachelor party, he is e-mailed a list of all the women he has slept with. Strangely, while the list has 101 names, his fiancÃ©e is only number 29. He assumes the list is a prank, courtesy of his best friends Zack (Neil Flynn) and Lester (Dash Mihok)âuntil he meets number 30, Carlotta Valdez, who is the stripper at his bachelor party. After sleeping with Carlotta, he realizes the list does, in fact, comprise all of his sexual partners, both past and future. Roderick cancels his upcoming wedding and begins to sequentially bed all the people on the list. Although he makes a connection with some of the women, he is unable to settle down and is compelled to continue until he has crossed all names off the list. His friends become concerned for his mental well being and convince him to bury the list. Before he does that, he sees only part of the next name, including \\"Dr.\\" and the first few letters. He falls for Lester's charming and quirky veterinarian (Leslie Bibb), after believing she is the next name on the list and finding they have much in common, only to discover that she does not return his feelings, and wants to be \\"just friends\\". He digs up the list and discovers she was not listed, after which she has an untimely accidental death. He continues on his mission. Throughout all this, a female vigilante, nicknamed by the media \\"Death Nell\\" (Winona Ryder), has been taking revenge on men who she feels have taken sexual advantage of women. She seduces these men and then drugs them to induce a coma, leaving them behind along with a line of feminist poetry spray painted on the wall or ceiling. But after her most recent conquest, she accidentally leaves behind her drivers license, exposing her real identity, Gillian De Raisx, to the world.

The review presents positive aspects of the app, claiming that it is \\"much much better than WhatsApp,\\" which is a popular and widely-used messaging platform. This statement could imply that the app has useful features, a more user-friendly interface, or other enhancements that give it an advantage over WhatsApp. However, the reviewer pointed out that the app does not support end-to-end encryption for group chats. End-to-end encryption is a vital security feature that ensures the privacy of users' messages, shielding the contents from potential hackers or other malicious actors.

He picks up an acid solution that he labels as solution A. To compare it with another solution he chooses a solution that is not an acid. He labels it as solution B.  Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar?

Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When I was small, my grandmother died. I was so sad that I had no tears. But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical   health. Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry.

By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Context: North Korea’s release of three U.S. citizens may help pave the way for talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, but questions remain as to whether those talks will succeed. At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.  The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. Question: after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners?

Find the work done by B in one day: B can do the work in 8 days, so B does 1/8 of the work in one day. 3. Find the combined work of A and B in one day: (1/6) + (1/8) = (8 + 6)/48 = 14/48 = 7/24 A and B together complete 7/24 of the work in one day. Now we know that A, B, and C together complete the work in 3 days. 4.

Now, let's calculate the payment for C. 6. Find the total work done by C in 3 days: Since C completed 1/24 of the work in one day, C did (1/24) * 3 = 3/24 = 1/8 of the work in 3 days. 7. Calculate the payment for C based on the ratio of work done: Since the total payment is Rs. 3200, C's payment will be 1/8 of the total amount: (1/8) * 3200 = Rs. 400.

Email allows businesses to send targeted messages to a large number of recipients with personalized content, promotional offers, and suggestions based on their preferences and browsing history. It is cost-effective, efficient, and widely accepted by consumers as a way to receive communications from companies. While the other options, such as bus, la ville, web page, and carrier pigeon, can be used for advertising purposes, they do not communicate directly with the consumers. Bus and la ville (city) generally refer to outdoor advertising like billboards and posters, which are more passive forms of advertising and not targeted to a specific group of consumers. Web pages also offer advertisements, but users need to visit the website to see them, rather than receiving the content in their inboxes.

In standard Russian, the word булочная is pronounced as [ˈbulətɕnəjə]. However, in the Moscow pronunciation, it's suggested that the word is pronounced as [ˈbuləʂnəjə]. This change refers to a phonological process where the 'tɕ' sound is pronounced more like 'ʂ' before another stop, which leads to the phrase being pronounced somewhat differently in the Moscow dialect as compared to Standard Russian.

Polyester couches should have a tag, usually found somewhere underneath the cushions. The tag will have one of the following letters or letter combinations written on it: w, s, sw, or x. these codes let you know what kind of cleaners you can use on your couch.","output":"After deciphering the couch tag and identifying the appropriate cleaning code, it is essential to follow these steps to clean your polyester couch effectively: 1. Gather the needed materials: Once you identify the proper cleaning code, gather the materials you will need such as a vacuum cleaner, soft brush, soft cloth or sponge, water, mild detergent, upholstery cleaner specific to your couch's code, a clean towel or paper towel, and a bucket or spray bottle. 2. Prepare the cleaning solution: If your couch tag has the letter 'W,' that means you can use water-based cleaning solutions. In this case, mix a few drops of mild detergent with water in a bucket or spray bottle until suds are formed. For 'S' and 'SW' codes, you can use a water-free solvent or a mild, water-based solution. It's best to use a specific upholstery cleaner according to your couch's code. The code 'X' requires vacuuming only and using any liquid cleaning solution is not recommended. 3. Vacuum the polyester couch: Start by removing the cushions (if removable) and thoroughly vacuum the couch to get rid of any dirt, dust, and debris. Use the vacuum cleaner's brush attachment to avoid damaging the upholstery and make sure to clean the crevices and corners properly. 4. Spot test: Before you start cleaning the entire couch, test the cleaning solution on a hidden area of the couch to make sure it doesn't cause any stains or discoloration. Wait for a few minutes, and if there is no negative reaction, you can proceed to clean the entire couch. 5. Apply the cleaning solution: If using a water-based solution, dip a soft cloth or sponge in the mixture and wring it out, so it's damp, not soaking wet. For solvent-based solutions, dampen a clean cloth with the solution. Start by gently blotting or rubbing the solution onto the fabric in a circular motion, working on one small section at a time. If using a spray bottle, lightly spray the solution on the couch and then wipe it with a soft cloth or sponge. 6. Deal with stubborn stains: If there are any stubborn stains on the couch, use a soft brush and the appropriate cleaning solution to gently scrub the stained area. Do not use excessive force as it may damage the fabric. 7. Dry the couch: After cleaning the entire couch, use a clean, dry towel or paper towel to pat down the areas you've cleaned. No need to rub aggressively; gently patting the couch will help remove excess moisture. If possible, open the windows or turn on a fan to speed up the drying process. 8. Vacuum again (if needed): If your couch's code required vacuuming only, give the couch another quick vacuum to ensure all debris is removed after the initial cleaning. 9. Reassemble the couch: Once your polyester couch is completely dry, place the cushions back in their respective positions. 10. Regular maintenance: It's essential to maintain your polyester couch by vacuuming it regularly, addressing spills and stains as soon as possible, and giving it a thorough cleaning every few months or as needed. By following these steps, you can successfully clean your polyester couch, ensuring its longevity and maintaining its appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One unnamed intelligence source told the news outlet that Clinton's email server was compromised by a public company acting as a front for the Chinese government, which the source says inserted a line of code that sent a \\"courtesy copy\\" of every email to Chinese authorities.      “When [the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General] did a very deep dive, they found in the actual metadata — the data which is at the header and footer of all the emails — that a copy, a ‘courtesy copy,’ was being sent to a third party and that third party was a known Chinese public company that was involved in collecting intelligence for China,” the intelligence source said.      No U.S. intelligence officials have publicly confirmed the report, and it was unclear if Trump was making the claim based on information not reported in the story.      China denied the report in a statement to Reuters, and said it \\"firmly oppose[s]\\" cyberattacks and the theft of state secrets.      “This isn’t the first time we’ve heard similar kinds of allegations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily news briefing.      “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity.

The Caller's report cited “two sources briefed on the matter.\\"      The FBI and the DOJ did not immediately respond to Fox News early Wednesday for comment.      It was not immediately clear if the president took to Twitter after learning about new intelligence, or was using the information from the earlier report.

Next move better be by the FBI & DOJ or, after all of their other missteps (Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA, Dirty Dossier etc.), their credibility will be forever gone!” he tweeted a little after midnight on Wednesday.      Trump said in an earlier tweet on Tuesday night: “China hacked Hillary Clinton’s private Email Server. Are they sure it wasn’t Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!”      Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said such accusations were nothing new.      “This isn’t the first time we’ve heard similar kinds of allegations,” Hua told a daily news briefing.      “China is a staunch defender of cybersecurity. We firmly oppose and crack down on any forms of internet attacks and the stealing of secrets,” she added, without specifically mentioning Trump or Clinton in her answer.      U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials to meddle with the 2016 presidential election.      A U.S. federal grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in July on charges of hacking the computer networks of Clinton and the Democratic Party.      Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 election and whether the campaign of Republican candidate Trump colluded with Moscow. Russia denies meddling in the elections, while Trump has denied any collusion.      Trump said in April 2017 China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the 2016 presidential election. He also did not provide any evidence backing his allegation at that time.      China has repeatedly denied any accusations of involvement in overseas hacking attacks.      China and the United States, whose ties are often fraught, are also currently in the midst of an increasingly bitter trade war. ||||| A Chinese-owned company penetrated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private server, according to sources briefed on the matter.      The company inserted code that forwarded copies of Clinton’s emails to the Chinese company in real time.      The Intelligence Community Inspector General warned of the problem, but the FBI subsequently failed to act, Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert said during a July hearing.      A Chinese-owned company operating in the Washington, D.C., area hacked Hillary Clinton’s private server throughout her term as secretary of state and obtained nearly all her emails, two sources briefed on the matter told The Daily Caller News Foundation.      The Chinese firm obtained Clinton’s emails in real time as she sent and received communications and documents through her personal server, according to the sources, who said the hacking was conducted as part of an intelligence operation.      The Chinese wrote code that was embedded in the server, which was kept in Clinton’s residence in upstate New York. The code generated an instant “courtesy copy” for nearly all of her emails and forwarded them to the Chinese company, according to the sources.      The Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) found that virtually all of Clinton’s emails were sent to a “foreign entity,” Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, said at a July 12 House Committee on the Judiciary hearing. He did not reveal the entity’s identity, but said it was unrelated to Russia. (RELATED: Gohmert: Watchdog Found Clinton Emails Were Sent To ‘Foreign Entity’)      Two officials with the ICIG, investigator Frank Rucker and attorney Janette McMillan, met repeatedly with FBI officials to warn them of the Chinese intrusion, according to a former intelligence officer with expertise in cybersecurity issues, who was briefed on the matter. He spoke anonymously, as he was not authorized to publicly address the Chinese’s role with Clinton’s server.      Among those FBI officials was Peter Strzok, who was then the bureau’s top counterintelligence official. Strzok was fired this month following the discovery he sent anti-Trump texts to his mistress and co-worker, Lisa Page. Strzok didn’t act on the information the ICIG provided him, according to Gohmert.      Gohmert mentioned in the Judiciary Committee hearing that ICIG officials told Strzok and three other top FBI officials that they found an “anomaly” on Clinton’s server.      The former intelligence officer TheDCNF spoke with said the ICIG “discovered the anomaly pretty early in 2015.”      “When [the ICIG] did a very deep dive, they found in the actual metadata — the data which is at the header and footer of all the emails — that a copy, a ‘courtesy copy,’ was being sent to a third party and that third party was a known Chinese public company that was involved in collecting intelligence for China,” the former intelligence officer told TheDCNF.      “The [the ICIG] believe that there was some level of phishing. But once they got into the server something was embedded,” he said. “The Chinese are notorious for embedding little surprises like this.”      The intelligence officer declined to name the Chinese company.      “We do know the name of the company. There are indications there are other ‘cutouts’ that were involved. I would be in a lot of trouble if I gave you the name,” he told TheDCNF.      A government staff official who’s been briefed on the ICIG’s findings told TheDCNF that the Chinese state-owned firm linked to the hacking operates in Washington’s northern Virginia suburbs. The source was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.      The company that penetrated Clinton’s server was not a technology firm and it served as a “front group” for the Chinese government, the source told TheDCNF.      The Fairfax and Loudoun county governments told TheDCNF that 13 state-owned Chinese companies operate in the area. Of those, three were not technologically oriented.      Fairfax County Economic Development Authority communications manager Seth Livingston told TheDCNF that all of the nine firms operating in his county were there in 2009 when Clinton began as secretary of state.      “Our Asian folks believe that all of the companies have been around and known to us since that time period,” he said in an email.      “This is the most combed over subject in modern American political history,” Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told TheDCNF. “The FBI spent thousands of hours investigating, and found no evidence of intrusion. That’s a fact.”      “But in an age where facts are alternative and truth isn’t truth, it’s no surprise that an outlet like the Daily Caller would try to distract us from very real and very immediate threats to our democracy brought by the man occupying the White House,” he continued.      Department of State Inspector General Steven A. Linick and then-ICIG I. Charles McCullough III scrutinized Clinton’s server in 2015. McCullough told Congress in July 2015 that her emails contained classified material.      “IC IG was involved in the classification review of certain information drawn from the private email server,” an agency spokeswoman told TheDCNF. She declined to comment further.      The two IGs asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the classified information was compromised, according to a July 23, 2015, New York Times report based on unnamed senior government officials.      The FBI issued a referral to the Justice Department in July 2015. The bureau warned that classified information may have been disclosed to a foreign power or to one of its agents.      “FBIHQ, Counterespionage Section, is opening a full investigation based on specific articulated facts provided by an 811 referral from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, dated July 6, 2015 regarding the potential compromise of classified information,” a July 10, 2015, FBI memo stated.      An 811 referral informs the FBI of classified information that was potentially released to a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.      “This investigation is also designated a Sensitive Investigative Matter (SIM) due to a connection to a current public official, political appointee or candidate,” the memo stated.      Then-FBI Deputy Director Mark F. Giuliano sent a follow-up memo on July 21, 2015, to President Barack Obama’s deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, about two conversations he had with her about the criminal referral.      “On 13 July 2015 and 20 July 2015, I verbally advised you of a Section 811(c) referral from the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community received by the FBI on 06 July 2015. The referral addressed the mishandling of classified information on the personal e-mail account and electronic media of a former high-level us Government official,” according to the FBI memo, which was hand delivered to Yates.      Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley declined to comment on this story.      Former FBI Director James Comey acknowledged in his recent book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” that the FBI was conducting a criminal investigation into Clinton’s conduct.      London Center for Policy Research’s vice president of operations, retired Col. Anthony Shaffer, told TheDCNF that Clinton’s server was vulnerable to hacking.      “Look, there’s evidence based on the complete lack of security hygiene on the server. Fourteen-year-old hackers from Canada could have probably hacked into her server and left very little trace,” Shaffer said. “Any sophisticated organization is going to be able to essentially get in and then clean up their presence.”      And a former consultant to the U.S. trade representative, Claude Barfield, told TheDCNF: “The Chinese were in the process of really gaining technological competence in 2009 to 2010. This begins to really take off in the early years of the Obama administration. The Obama administration was kind of late and there was this slow reaction about how sophisticated the Chinese were.”      EDITOR’S NOTE:      The FBI released a statement saying they had “not found any evidence” of an intrusion of Clinton’s server.      The statement does not address a central aspect of TheDCNF’s reporting, which was that the ICIG briefed top bureau officials on three separate occasions to warn the FBI of an “anomaly” they found 30,000 in-bound and outgoing emails. Former Director of the FBI James Comey himself conceded in July 2016 that while the Bureau assessed the server could have been exploited, “given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.”      “It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account,” Comey concluded.      According to two independent sources, ICIG found such evidence and briefed the FBI on it three times.      After releasing the statement, the FBI refused to confirm or deny to TheDCNF that such briefings ever happened.

For music lovers across the globe, this collaboration signifies a thrilling fusion of the past and present, set to reshape the traditional stage of the elite opera festival. For the uninitiated, the Bayreuth Festival is the zenith of operatic achievement in the world of classical music. Since its inception in 1876, the annual festival has drawn leading figures from the arts, politics, and high society to Bayreuth, Germany, in a glittering celebration of Richard Wagner's work. In this veritable Mecca of music, the composer's descendants continue to guard his legacy, setting a gold standard for performances of his revered productions.  However, recent times have called for a new approach to preserving and promoting Wagner's work. And thus, in a bid to breathe fresh life into the Bayreuth Festival, the Head of City Opera has extended an artistic branch to Katarina Wagner, Richard Wagner’s great-granddaughter and the current co-director of the festival. The key objectives of this collaboration are three-fold: To diversify the audience, widen the reach of the festival, and promote a more inclusive approach to classical music.  It is a well-documented fact that the fan base of classical music, particularly opera, has been predominantly white and affluent. Yet, in this landmark initiative, the Head of City Opera and Ms. Wagner join hands to break down these barriers through investments in modernizing performances, revitalizing stagecraft, and adopting more innovative visual designs. Moreover, the partnership signals a commitment to cultivating an environment where art is more accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for people from all walks of life.  The collaboration has also unveiled ambitious plans for nurturing fresh talent, a move that will encourage young musicians, singers, and operatic professionals to participate and share their work on the iconic stage. A new mentorship program, backed by the Head of City Opera and Ms. Wagner, aims to provide invaluable guidance and support to those eager to forge a career in the demanding world of classical music. As the sails of change catch the wind, the legendary festival is expected to explore contemporary issues relevant to younger generations and create a fusion of social awareness through the emotive power of music. The partnership will focus on fostering greater dialogue and understanding among cultures, while staying true to the core of Wagner’s musical genius.  In conclusion, the much-anticipated partnership between the Head of City Opera and Katarina Wagner is set to bring sweeping changes to the world of classical music. It marks a bold step away from a one-dimensional perspective, embracing instead the complexities of a global society while making space for the voices and visions of an ever-evolving generation. If one thing is for certain, Bayreuth – and its audience – will never be the same again."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her.        Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic  artist.        She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died.        Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life.        Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait.        There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception .

Write a summary based on this article: Garrett Haake / NBC Protesters marched down the beach in New York's Hamptons to demonstrate against the power of deep-pocketed donors over the political process.      SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. – In one of the most sizable shows of force from protestors seen on the campaign trail in weeks, a group of more than 60 demonstrators – backed by air support in the form of a banner plane – staged a protest of Mitt Romney's third and final fundraiser here on Sunday.      The fundraiser, at the beachside home of billionaire industrialist David Koch, was to cap a day of fundraising in New York's tony Hamptons communities that could bring in millions of dollars for the campaign's \\"Victory\\" fund. It marked Romney's return to the campaign trail after a week of vacation at his summer home in New Hampshire.      Romney and his guests received a loud – and at times profane – welcome from dozens of protesters representing organizations from Occupy Long Island to Greenpeace, which largely blocked a section of Meadow Lane to shout, \\"Shame on You!\\" (and unprintable variants thereof). The protesters waved signs at those who attended the back-to-back fundraisers hosted by Clifford Sobel, the former U.S. ambassador to Brazil, and later, by Koch.      It was Koch, whose net worth Forbes magazine pegs at 25 billion, who drew most of the protesters’ ire. Holding signs that compared the fundraiser's reported ticket price of 50,000 to their annual salaries or even life savings, the protesters decried the power of donors like Koch and his allies over American politics.      When local law enforcement officially cleared the protest, the demonstrators decamped from the street and – in one of the strangest visual moments of the campaign – marched nearly a mile down the beach to Koch's house.      Accompanied by a bass drum, horns and even a tenor saxophone, the ragtag band arrived at the stretch of beach behind Koch's house after a 20-minute walk, where roughly a dozen police, Secret Service and Romney staffers stood on the dunes that marked the line of demarcation between the public beach and Koch's private land, and told the protesters they could go no further.      And so they stayed - chanting, singing, and waving signs as a plane buzzed overhead, pulling a banner that read, \\"Romney has a Koch Problem. MoveOn.Org.\\" While some protestors shouted obscenities as the security watching them from the dunes above (and from a Coast Guard vessel off the coast), this reporter saw no direct confrontations between protestors and authorities.      The climax of the protest event came when the saxophonist, David Intrator, 55, of New York City, led the protesters in a spotty rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" which most of the group joined, though some continued to chant slogans as they sang. ||||| EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. – In a caper that seemed made for the movies, two protesters were arrested Sunday after authorities said they tried to sail across a pond to crash a tony Mitt Romney fundraiser and hit a police boat.The water, it seems, was the only way in to the home of Revlon Inc. Chairman Ronald Perelman.Romney aides and Perelman staff armed with clipboards, along with local police, tightly controlled access to the circular road leading to the luncheon at Perelman’s estate — a property secluded among the pines off Montauk Highway. But the home is on Georgica Pond, and two men from Wainscott, a town that abuts the pond, saw an opportunity, authorities said.East Hampton Village authorities said David Fink and Simon Kinsella attempted to sail across the police line, ignoring orders from East Hampton Marine Patrol, and “subsequently struck” the police boat.Police said one of the men attempted to flee by swimming to shore; he was arrested on the beach.

I have a new situation: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  But I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.

He was first noted by history in 1661, as part of a diplomatic mission from the Don Cossacks to the Kalmyks. That same year Razin went on a long-distance pilgrimage to the great Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea for the benefit of his soul. After that, all trace of him was lost for six years, when he reappeared as the leader of a robber community established at Panshinskoye, among the marshes between the rivers Tishina and Ilovlya, from whence he levied tribute from all vessels passing up and down the Volga. A long war with Poland in 1654-1667 and Sweden in 1656-1658 put heavy demands upon the people of Russia. Taxes increased, as did conscription. Many peasants, hoping to escape these burdens, fled south and joined bands of Razin's marauding Cossacks. They were also joined by many others who were disaffected with the Russian government, including people of the lower classes, as well as representatives of non-Russian ethnic groups such as Kalmyks, that were being oppressed at the time. Razin's first considerable exploit was to destroy the great naval convoy consisting of the treasury barges and the barges of the Patriarch and the wealthy merchants of Moscow. Razin then sailed down the Volga with a fleet of 35 vessels, capturing the more important forts on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of 1668, he defeated the voivode Yakov Bezobrazov, sent against him from Astrakhan, and in the spring embarked on a predatory expedition into Daghestan and Persia, which lasted for eighteen months.

The proposals address consumer protection, executive pay, bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives, and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions, among others. In January 2010, Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading. The proposals were dubbed \\"The Volcker Rule\\", in recognition of Paul Volcker, who has publicly argued for the proposed changes. What was introduced by President Barack Obama in June 2009?","output":"In June 2009, United States President Barack Obama and his key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals aimed at addressing various issues within the financial sector. These proposals targeted multiple areas including consumer protection, executive pay, bank capital requirements, regulation of shadow banking systems, derivatives, and increased authority for the Federal Reserve. The goal was to revamp the financial system and reduce the risks of future economic crises. 1. Consumer Protection: This proposal focused on improving consumer protection in financial services. It aimed to establish transparency and fairness in dealing with consumers, prevent abusive practices, and create a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency responsible for supervising and enforcing consumer protection regulations. 2. Executive Pay: This aspect targeted improving corporate governance and executive compensation practices. The proposed regulations aimed to align executive incentives with long-term shareholder value, ensure that pay packages did not encourage excessive risk-taking, and provide shareholders with a say on executive compensation. 3. Bank Capital Requirements: This proposal involved strengthening banks' financial cushions or capital requirements to ensure that they have enough resources to absorb losses during economic crises. It was intended to make banks more resilient to financial shocks and help maintain the overall stability of the financial system. 4. Shadow Banking and Derivatives: The proposals sought to expand regulation of the shadow banking system, which includes investment banks, hedge funds, and various investment vehicles that operate beyond the reach of regulators. Additionally, regulations on derivatives, complex financial instruments that derive their value from underlying assets, were proposed to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk. 5. Enhanced Authority for the Federal Reserve: As part of the proposals, the Federal Reserve was to be granted more authority to safely wind down systemically important institutions, thus preventing the kind of disorderly collapse that characterized some major financial institutions during the 2008 financial crisis. In January 2010, President Obama proposed additional regulations restricting banks' ability to engage in proprietary trading, which is when banks trade in financial instruments for their own profit rather than on behalf of their clients. These additional regulations were named \\"The Volcker Rule\\" in honor of Paul Volcker, who had been advocating for these regulatory changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Problem:find the name of Person table for which age greater than engineer ordered ascending by name Solution:","output":"The task is asking to create an SQL statement that will select the names from a table called Person based on specified conditions. Based on the problem statement, we have to retrieve the names from a Person table where the age is greater than 'engineer'. However, it seems to be a confusing problem as 'engineer' is not a number nor a known constant related with age.  Assuming, engineer may refer to another table specifying a certain age, but without this information, it's impossible to make a perfectly matching SQL statement. Ignoring the confusing 'engineer' part and under the assumption that it refers to a specific age, the SQL statement would be like selecting names from the 'Person' table where the 'age' column value is greater than a specific value, and sorting these results in ascending order by 'name'.  Here's an approximate solution: SELECT name  FROM Person  WHERE age > {age}  ORDER BY name ASC; In this case, replace {age} with the integer value that represents the age of 'engineer'.  Please provide more information about the 'engineer' part, with the specific age or how it is associated with the 'Person' table, in order to get a more accurate SQL statement."},{"instruction":"Q:-  A mold spore floats through the air - The spore lands on a piece of bread - The spore grows hyphae into the bread - The mold forms a colony - Sporangiophores grow upward  What might be the last step of the process?

Article: E-waste is fast becoming a serious problem around the world. This report will examine this problem and provide some possible ways to solve it. We live in a society that is producing and using electronics  all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled. Burying  e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt. In recent years,  _ . However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly. Another way is to make producers responsible  for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted. They should then make sure _ are properly recycled or reused. As for us, we should try to cut down on e-waste. Change electronics only when we have to. And don't buy a product just to have the latest model. E-waste is a serious problem in the modern world. Both producers and users must take actions and try to keep it to the smallest amount. Question: According to the passage, it is often   _   to buy new electronics than to repair old ones.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu... Question: What does the author probably believe? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The author probably believes in the importance and effectiveness of the annual flu vaccination.

Given the question: Question: \\"What is required for the zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation?\\"  Context: \\"Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"For zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation, several conditions and factors must be present: 1. Presence of an electrolyte: Like any other metal, zinc corrosion requires the presence of an electrolyte, which is usually water containing dissolved ions, such as oxygen and salts. The electrolyte facilitates the flow of ions, allowing the corrosion process to occur. 2. Exposure to oxygen: Oxidation occurs when zinc reacts with oxygen, so it must be exposed to an environment containing oxygen. This exposure typically occurs through contact with the atmosphere or other oxygen-containing environments. 3. Time: The corrosion process takes time, depending on the thickness of the zinc layer, the environmental conditions, and the concentration of electrolytes. As zinc continues to corrode, its protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate degrades, allowing the process to continue until the zinc completely corrodes away. 4. Formation of localized corrosion cells: Zinc usually corrodes uniformly across its surface unless there are differences in local electrolytes, such as humidity or pollution levels, which can create localized corrosion cells. These localized cells can accelerate the corrosion process, eventually leading to the complete corrosion of the zinc. 5. Breakdown of the protective layer: The zinc oxide and carbonate layer formed on the zinc surface provides protection against corrosion. However, if this layer is damaged through mechanical forces, such as scratching or abrasion, the underlying zinc can be exposed to the corrosive environment, leading to the eventual corrosion of the entire zinc layer. 6. Presence of galvanic corrosion: If zinc is in contact with a less reactive metal like iron or steel, it may undergo galvanic corrosion, where the less reactive metal becomes the cathode, and zinc becomes the anode, sacrificing itself to protect the other metal. This process can hasten the corrosion of zinc until it completely corrodes away. In summary, for zinc to completely corrode away by oxidation, an electrolyte, oxygen, time, localized corrosion cells, breakdown of the protective layer, and the presence of galvanic corrosion must be present. These factors can vary depending on the environment, application, and protective measures taken, such as regular maintenance and ensuring that the zinc layer is free from damage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves - The waves contain sediment from the ocean - The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach - The wind and current sometimes push the water and particles harder - Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks - The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach - The waves go back out into the ocean - The waves carry the new particles with them - Rocks and the beach look a little different.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose wave sizes decrease happens, how will it affect LESS erosion by the ocean.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of decreased wave sizes has a direct effect on the process of coastal erosion by the ocean. The reduction in wave sizes would lead to a lower energy force being applied to the rocks and sand on the beach by the ocean waves. As a result, the overall erosion process would be affected, causing less erosion to occur due to several reasons. 1. Reduced force of impact: As the size of the waves decreases, the force with which the water and sediment particles hit the rocks and sand on the beach would also be reduced. Larger waves typically have more energy and thus generate a more significant collision force, leading to faster erosion. Smaller waves lack the same energy and have a lesser impact on coastal rocks and sand, resulting in slower erosion rates. 2. Reduced sediment transportation: Larger ocean waves have a greater capacity to transport sediment and small rocks from the shore back into the ocean. As the wave sizes decrease, their transportation capacity is diminished, meaning that less sediment and smaller rocks are moved. Consequently, the process of erosion is further slowed down as there is less active transport of sediment and broken rock particles from the shore into the ocean. 3. Changes in wind and current strength: Decreased wave sizes might indicate a change in wind patterns and ocean currents in the area. These changes can directly impact the amount of wind and current energy applied to the coastal rocks and sand, which would lead to additional variations in the erosion process. The reduced wind and current strength would mean that the water and sediment particles are pushed less forcefully against the shore, resulting in decreased erosion rates. 4. Altered beach morphology: The perturbation of decreased wave sizes can also change the morphology, or shape, of the beach over time. Smaller wave sizes might lead to an increase in sediment deposition and the formation of different beach features, which could further affect coastal erosion rates. A more stable and sediment-rich beach environment could act as a buffer to the destructive forces of waves and slow down rock erosion at the shoreline. Indirectly, if the reduction in wave sizes is significant enough, it might even alter the broader coastal ecosystems and human activities in the area. These changes could impact the availability of resources, such as sand for construction or shellfish for food, which might prompt human intervention to manage erosion or coastal processes differently. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation of decreased wave sizes has both direct and indirect effects on the process of coastal erosion by the ocean. The key mechanisms through which these effects manifest include the reduction in impact force, sediment transportation, and changes in wind and current strengths. These factors ultimately contribute to less erosion by the ocean and can have broader implications for the coastal environment and human activities."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Feldshuh recently passed the 400performance mark Off-Broadway and at the Helen Hayes Theater, and plans to perform the role in the U.K. sometime next year. But she may have created an international incident with her controversial comments. \\"I'm taking the play to London, which in itself is an act of courage - it's a pit of anti-Semitism,\\" Feldshuh told several hundred women, including her 93-year-old mother, Lily, on hand to screen a short documentary, \\"The Journey to Golda's Balcony,\\" and raise money for the Museum of Jewish Heritage. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington responded: \\"We would not wish to comment on a statement we haven't heard ourselves.

She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts.  It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it.  She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins.  She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back.  Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.  Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.  Taking them in at noon, she met Stoddard himself.

Q:Process:  - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less rain that year happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER ravines forming.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Step 1: Assumption of the perturbation hypothesis In this step, we assume that less rain occurs that year, as mentioned in the perturbation hypothesis. Step 2: Analyze the impact of less rain on the formation of a stream or river With less rain, there would be fewer water sources contributing to the formation of a stream or river. This could lead to smaller or even no streams or rivers forming in that particular year. Step 3: Analyze the impact of less rain on erosion Since there are fewer water sources, there would likely be less erosion. Streams and rivers play a significant role in erosion and cutting into the soil and bedrock. With less water, the force responsible for eroding the soil and bedrock will be weaker, leading to less erosion. Step 4: Analyze the impact of less rain on the deepening of gashes As a consequence of less erosion, the deepening of gashes through continuous erosion would be slower. The gashes would not form as deep or as quickly as they would under normal rainfall conditions. Step 5: Analyze the impact of less rain on the drying up of the river With less rain that year, it is possible that the river could dry up more quickly due to less replenishment from rainfall. However, this would still depend on other factors such as temperature and evaporation rates. Step 6: Analyze the impact of less rain on the formation of dry ravines Since the erosion process is slower and the deepening of gashes is affected, fewer or smaller dry ravines may form in that year due to the lessened impact of the water on the landscape. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis of less rain that year does have a direct impact on the process of ravine formation. Less rain affects the formation of streams and rivers, the erosion rate, the deepening of gashes, and the formation of dry ravines. As a consequence, fewer or smaller ravines would likely form under these conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

What is a 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film written and directed by Eliseo Subiela, that has uncredited adaptations made from it to  a 2001 American science fiction-mystery film based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel ? The answer is:","output":"The 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film written and directed by Eliseo Subiela is called \\"Man Facing Southeast\\" (original title: Hombre Mirando al Sudeste). The film tells the story of a mysterious man named Rantés, who claims to be an alien from another planet, and his relationship with a psychiatrist named Dr. Julio Denis at a mental institution in Buenos Aires. The movie explores themes of mental illness, human connection, and the nature of reality. The 2001 American science fiction-mystery film that has uncredited adaptations made from \\"Man Facing Southeast\\" is \\"K-PAX.\\" Directed by Iain Softley, this film is based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel of the same name. In \\"K-PAX,\\" a man named Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, claims to be an alien from the planet K-PAX. He is admitted to a mental institution in the United States, where he forms a bond with his psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell, played by Jeff Bridges. Similar to \\"Man Facing Southeast,\\" \\"K-PAX\\" deals with determining the truth about Prot's identity and the meaning of his presence among humans. Both films explore themes of mental health, the nature of reality, and human connection, with the central plot revolving around a psychiatrist trying to understand his enigmatic patient who claims to be an alien visitor. Although \\"K-PAX\\" is based on Gene Brewer's novel, its similarities to \\"Man Facing Southeast\\" have led many to suggest that the American film was influenced or partly adapted from the Argentine movie without giving proper credit to the source material."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jackson) is a twenty-eight-year veteran of the LAPD. A single and widowed father, he is particularly strict with his two children, Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and Celia (Regine Nehy). As his kids leave for school, the new neighbors begin moving in next door. They are a young interracial couple, Chris and Lisa Mattson (Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington), who are recently married and buying their first home. Chrisâs first exchanges with Abel have somewhat hostile undertones, with Abel making comments about Chrisâ smoking (which Chris hides from Lisa) and listening to hip hop music. The following night, Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Unknown to them, Abel's children are watching. Abel arrives home to see this spectacle and is upset, so he repositions the home security floodlights so they shine into Chris and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. When Chris confronts him, Abel claims that the lights are part of his security system to prevent crime and says that it is a complex process to shut down the system and the lights. Abel attends a housewarming party hosted by Chris and Lisa. He is garrulous but has an edge, and criticizes Chris and his friends for their liberal political and social tendencies. He also exposes Chris' smoking to Lisa, as Chris has been discarding his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. As he leaves, Chris tells Abel that he is starting to take offense to him, but does not plan to move. One evening, they hear noises downstairs, and find the tires of Chris' car slashed. They suspect Abel and call the police. However, because of Abel's status within the LAPD, the arriving officers are unable to do anything.

According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

Movie title: The Vanishing Private Movie plot: Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots. Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, claiming that anyone could recognize it. Peter demands Donald to re-paint the gun to make it \\"hard to see\\". Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks off to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\" disregarding the 'keep out' sign (\\"It didn't say 'positively' \\", says Donald) and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger and uses to paint the cannon. When Pete arrives, he is shocked to see that the cannon is gone, believing it to be stolen. But it is not stolen as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head in the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside. Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to look, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald into the bucket of invisible paint. When Donald runs away from Pete, the latter finds out Donald has become invisible seeing Donald's footprints on the ground. Donald swims across a lake and the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, searching through the flowers, until he accidentally throws the flowers on Donald revealing his outline. Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him but Donald gets away again. The flowers give Pete an idea to find Donald. When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after Pete asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\" and the invisible Donald puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making Pete scream in pain and jump around like a madman and the General wonders what is up with Pete. Donald is running around a kitchen and then sees some pies in the window and Donald takes a pie and eats it. Pete then notices this and Donald throws the pie in Pete's face. Donald is skipping... Answer:","output":"From the given movie plot for \\"The Vanishing Private\\", the character Pete holds the rank of Sergeant. Initially, he scolds Donald Duck for his inadequate paint job on a cannon, ordering him to repaint it so that it is \\"hard to see\\". This demonstrates his senior position in the military hierarchy and his authority over private Donald Duck. In the unfolding story, Sergeant Pete later assumes the role of a detective, tracking down Donald who has become invisible due to the \\"invisible paint.\\" This plotline illustrates that Sergeant Pete is persistent in his duty and takes his responsibility as a superior officer seriously, nevertheless, the narrative largely exploits this for comedic effect.  Towards the end of the story, Pete's interactions with the General further highlight his military rank. He attempts to explain the unusual circumstances of chasing an invisible private to the General, but his antics only serve to convince the General that something is amiss with Sergeant Pete.  In summary, Pete holds the rank of Sergeant in the army. His role seemingly ranges from overseeing Donald Duck's duties to attempting to maintain order and discipline following Donald's unintentional use of the invisible paint. It's important to note that the comedy is largely drawn from the absurd and chaotic situations that result from these circumstances. If you're considering investing in this film, it may be worth considering how much potential you believe this style of humor has to appeal to audiences, along with other factors such as production costs, potential revenue from different streams, and the track record of the creative team involved.

Let your boss know that you are actively looking for ways to improve your performance. Make it a point to regularly ask for feedback. Indicate that you’re not just looking for a pat on the back. Try saying, “I know you were happy with the report I turned in last week. But were there any suggestions you have? I’d love to do an even better job next time.” Your boss will appreciate it if you show that you are able to think outside of the box. When they ask for ideas in a meeting, don’t be afraid to speak up and suggest trying something new.  You might say, “Let’s look into increasing our online presence. I know we’re a traditional firm, but more and more people are using social media for business purposes.” Don't take offense if your boss doesn't take all of your suggestions. Notice what sorts of ideas they respond to, and try to offer better ideas in the future. If you have a good relationship with your boss, it’s likely that they’ve done a few favors for you. Make sure to offer a sincere thank you when it feels right. For example, if they let you duck out of a meeting early to take your mom to the doctor, let them know that you appreciate the kindness. You don't have to go overboard with your thanks. A simple \\"I really appreciate your flexibility\\" will likely be appropriate. You can send an email or stop by their office to say this in person. Nothing is less impressive than lying. Make sure to demonstrate that you are a truthful, trustworthy person. Be upfront with your boss (and others) and don’t ever try to manipulate the truth. For example, don’t take credit for work you didn’t do. If your boss mistakenly compliments you for another team member’s work, make sure to say, “I actually didn’t have a hand in that, but I’ll let Beth know how pleased you are.” Work on being someone who can cooperate and compromise. Show this by being willing to work on a team. You can also help out co-workers with their tasks, and delegate responsibilities when it is appropriate.  Don’t whine about others to your boss. If you have a legitimate complaint which affects work, of course you should voice it in a professional manner. You might say, \\"I'm having a little trouble managing Bob. He is routinely late to team meetings, and calls in sick at least once week. Do you have some thoughts on how I can get him to increase productivity?\\" If you're simply annoyed that your co-worker frequently tells you stories about their dog, you probably don't need to bother your boss with that. Showing up and slogging through the work day is not good enough. Demonstrate your enthusiasm for your job by showing some energy. Be ready to engage with others. You should also be willing to stay late or show up early as necessary.  To give yourself an energy boost throughout the day, try taking a brisk walk over lunch. Set yourself up for success by getting plenty of rest, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Acting professional means treating others with respect. Use preferred forms of address, and follow office etiquette. This means no texting during meetings or leaving dirty dishes in the communal kitchen. Don't engage in office gossip. If others are gossiping, either change the subject or excuse yourself. Similarly, maintain a professional appearance. If your workplace has a dress code, make sure to follow it. Even if they don't, make sure that you look put together whenever you show up for work. Dress appropriately for your industry. Wear clothes that are clean, unwrinkled, and fit well, take care to keep your hair and fingernails neat and clean, and avoid wearing strong cologne or perfume. Summary:","output":"Curiosity reflects intelligence and eagerness to learn. Develop this trait by seeking knowledge, attending meetings even outside your domain, staying updated with industry trends, and asking for feedback to improve. Be open to new ideas and maintain a good relationship with your boss, showing gratitude when appropriate. Demonstrate trustworthiness, cooperation, and compromise in your work. Avoid complaining unless it affects work performance. Show enthusiasm and energy by being willing to go the extra mile and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Uphold professionalism by treating others with respect, adhering to office etiquette, and maintaining a polished appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Solve this math problem Solve 95 = 32*h - 13*h for h.","output":"To solve the given math problem, we need to find the value of \\"h\\" in the equation: 95 = 32h - 13h Firstly, we need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with \\"h\\" in them. 32h and -13h are like terms (terms containing the same variable with the same exponent). So, we can combine them by adding their coefficients: 32h - 13h = (32 - 13)h = 19h Now, the simplified equation becomes: 95 = 19h We now need to isolate the \\"h\\" variable to one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \\"h,\\" which is 19. 95 / 19 = 19h / 19 Simplifying the equation, we get: 5 = h So, the value of \\"h\\" in the given equation is 5."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Leonard Michael Maltin (born December 18, 1950) is an American film critic and historian, as well as an author of several mainstream books on cinema, focusing on nostalgic, celebratory narratives. He is known as a \\"go-to\\" critic for the major studios, for writing the shortest review in the U.S. and for creating the Walt Disney Treasures series.  - Humphrey the Bear is a cartoon character created by the Walt Disney studio in 1950. He first appeared in the Goofy cartoon \\"Hold That Pose\\", in which Goofy tried to take his picture. After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons: \\"Grin and Bear It\\", \\"Bearly Asleep\\", \\"Rugged Bear\\", and \\"Beezy Bear\\". Disney gave him his own series in 1955, but only two films resulted (\\"Hooked Bear\\" and \\"In the Bag\\") before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects. When the shorts division closed, Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own, starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo (the six others were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale (counting as one), and Figaro). The Humphrey cartoons have been aptly described by Leonard Maltin as \\"belly-laugh\\" shorts, and they feature a broader, wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags.  - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters.  - Featurette is a term used in the American film industry to designate a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \\"small feature\\" (the ending \\"-ette\\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamlinersand several French films of that lengthceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short. Its use outside the USA is unknown, although it was as commonly applied to foreign imports as to domestic productions within that country.  - Hooked Bear is a 1956 short film in the Humphrey the Bear series . The short can be found on disc 2 of Disney Rarities : Celebrated Shorts : 1920s -- 1960s and also in a handful of cheap public domain VHS tapes .  - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.  - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film.  - Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two chipmunk cartoon characters created in 1943, at Walt Disney Productions. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century cabinet maker Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill \\"Tex\\" Henson, a story artist at the studio.  - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.  - In the Bag is a 1956 Walt Disney's animated theatrical short directed by Jack Hannah and featuring park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore and his comedic foil Humphrey the Bear.

Is \\"In the first notable encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the statement provided does highlight Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797 and his advance into Austrian territory, it doesn't accurately address the distance between the French incursion into Leoben and how close they were to reaching Vienna. Let us delve deeper into the details to provide a more comprehensive answer. The French incursion into Leoben happened during the French Revolutionary Wars, specifically as part of the War of the First Coalition. Napoleon Bonaparte, a young and ambitious general, took charge of the French armies and sought to achieve victory against the Austrian forces. After Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Tarvis, the French forces advanced further into Austrian territory. They eventually reached the town of Leoben in April 1797. Leoben is located approximately 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the Austrian capital, Vienna. French forces had made significant progress, but they were still some distance away from the capital. Furthermore, as they approached Leoben, they encountered the Austrian armies led by Archduke Charles, who sought to defend their homeland from the French forces. At that time, Napoleon opted for diplomacy instead of continuing the campaign towards the Austrian capital. On April 18, 1797, the preliminary Treaty of Leoben was signed between France and Austria. This treaty, which was largely a truce, established the framework for future negotiations that would culminate in the Treaty of Campo Formio later that year. The Treaty of Campo Formio would officially end the War of the First Coalition and result in territorial gains for France. In conclusion, the French incursion into Leoben did bring them closer to Vienna, but they were approximately 145 kilometers (90 miles) away from the capital when the preliminary Treaty of Leoben was signed. This halted Napoleon's advance towards Vienna and marked a turning point in the diplomatic relations between France and Austria during the French Revolutionary Wars."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Herb Jeffries (born Umberto Alexander Valentino; September 24, 1913 - May 25, 2014) was an African-American actor of film and television and popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known of his baritone voice. He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. From Detroit, at the urging of Louis Armstrong, Jeffries moved to Chicago where he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by Al Capone. Jeffries began his career working with Erskine Tate and his Vendome Orchestra. Tate signed the 19-year-old Jeffries to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago. His break came during the 1933 Chicago World's Fair A Century of Progress International Exposition singing with the Earl Hines Orchestra on Hines' national broadcasts live from the Grand Terrace Cafe. His first recordings were with Hines in 1934, including \\"Just to be in Carolina\\". By 1940, he was singing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and then recorded with him from 1940 to 1942. His 1940 recording of \\"Flamingo\\" with Ellington, released in 1941, sold more than 14 million copies in its day. His name had been Herbert Jeffrey, but the credits on the record mistakenly called him Jeffries, so he renamed himself to match the typo. \\"Flamingo\\" was later covered by a white singer, the popular vocalist Tony Martin. During his time with the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a lead vocalist, Jeffries proved his talent as a mature singer, demonstrating his wide vocal range in such songs as \\"I Don't Know What Kind of Blues I've Got,\\" \\"The Brownskin Gal,\\" and \\"Jump for Joy\\" (all 1941). The 1944 single \\"My Little Brown Book\\" by Ellington and his Famous Orchestra, on which Jeffries provided vocals, reached No. 4 on Billboard R&B chart. Later on, Jeffries was replaced in the Ellington's band by Al Hibbler.  In his teens, Jeffries had developed a fine voice, initially singing in higher registers. He started out his singing career as a lyrical tenor, but, on the advice of Duke Ellington's longtime music arranger, Billy Strayhorn, he lowered his range to mimic the vocal stylings of crooner Bing Crosby. Jeffries became a \\"silken, lusty baritone,\\" according to music critic Jonny Whiteside.  In 1945, Jeffries had a hit on the Billboard R&B chart with \\"Left A Good Deal In Mobile\\" (No. 2), on which he was accompanied by pianist Joe Liggins and his band Honeydrippers. Then, he moved to Europe and performed there for many years, including at nightclubs he owned. He was back in America by the 1950s, recording jazz records again, including 1957 collection of ballads, Say It Isn't So.  In 1995, at age 81, he recorded The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again), a Nashville album of songs on the Warner Western label.

However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance.

It's when people stop working because they want better things like more money or better rules at work. They do this to tell their bosses and the people in charge that they want things to change.  Well, in Wales, there is a group of people called the Welsh Government. They are like the moms and dads that help make the rules for everyone living there. Right now, they are talking about a new rule. This new rule is about people who work in the public sector. The public sector is a group of jobs where people work to help others, like teachers, nurses, or those who keep our cities clean. Right now, there are some rules that do not let public workers go on strike easily. The Welsh Government wants to change that with this new rule. They want to make it easier for the workers to say when they are unhappy and want better conditions at work. Why would they want to do this? The people who work in the public sector are very important because they help keep our towns, cities, and lives running smoothly. If they are not happy, they might not do their jobs as well. The Welsh Government wants to make sure that these workers feel heard and have a way to tell everyone if something is unfair. But, like all new rules, some people might not like the idea. They may worry that public workers going on strike will make it hard for everyone else who needs their help. There might be some arguments and discussions about this new rule, but that's okay. It's important for everyone to share their thoughts and try to figure out the best way to help the public workers and the people living in Wales. So, with this new rule, the Welsh Government is showing that they care about public workers and want to make sure they have a way to share their feelings and ask for change. We will have to wait and see if this rule becomes a new law or not, but it is a good step towards helping people who work hard to keep our communities safe and happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  Please answer this question : Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, ginger or bananas?

This book is very dry reading, and difficult for a beginner to go through. No color graphs. Just boring tables with numbers, and many words. Not an easy book for a visual learner. Seasonality is hinted upon, but no good charts provided, and he does not really tell you when to do what, or what triggers or conditions to look for to enter a position.

First, we need to simplify the numbers on the left side of the equation: -12 - 344 - 199 = -555 So our equation now looks like this: -555 = -111*j 2. Now, we need to find the value of 'j'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -111: -555 ÷ -111 = (-111 * j) ÷ -111 3.

Continue writing the following text. Peggy filled the bathtub with hot water and bubbles but not salts, because the  Possible answers: [a]. salts smelled awful.; [b]. bubbles smelled awful.;","output":"[a]. salts smelled awful. Peggy lived alone in a small, cozy apartment nestled within the heart of the bustling city. Its size might warrant complaints from some, but she found it comforting – more like a snug nest of warmth and familiarity than anything else. Every object in that small space was utterly and completely hers, every inch of the room saturated with her presence. From the little trinkets that adorned her bookshelf, to the lusciously green houseplants placed strategically by the window – they all played a part in creating an environment that screamed ‘Peggy’. Amongst everything that filled her haven, her bathtub shared a special place in her heart. It wasn't fancy, not a clawfoot or a jacuzzi, just a simple, old-fashioned tub. But she cherished it for what it was – a sanctuary where she escaped the day's humdrum. As the shadows grew long and the city outside her window danced with reflections of setting sun, Peggy found solace in the ritual of filling up the bathtub. Hot water from the taps gushed forth, sprinkling into the belly of the white ceramic tub. She watched as the steam curled upward in gentle waves and lost itself in the bathroom's dampened air. Quietly, she dripped shower gel into the water and watched as hundreds of tiny bubbles started to form, each catching the soft gleaming light, twinkling like minuscule stars suspended on a celestial sea. She was always careful about what she put into the bathwater. Despite the market’s myriad of invitations to indulge in Epsom salts, Dead Sea salts, Himalayan pink salts – all promising to detox, to rejuvenate, and uplift – Peggy decided against them. Her reason was trivial to some but very personal to her. Simply put, the salts smelled awful. On one of her ventures to the city's famous organic markets, she decided to buy a bag of lavender-infused Epsom salts, swayed by the vendor's captivating description of a soothing, skin-nourishing experience. But upon arriving home, she realized that the scent was nothing like the lavender fields that she had always imagined. It was overpowering and too artificial, more like a perfume factory gone wrong. It invaded her senses in a way that felt intrusive. Peggy was a woman of simple tastes. She liked the more refined scents – the fresh aroma of dew-kissed grass, the intoxicating smell of old, musty books, and the lingering fragrance of rain on fresh earth. The scent of bath salts, on the other hand, was too loud, too assertive, too out of place in her sanctuary that welcomed gentle fragrances. So, the bag of lavender-infused Epsom salts found its way into the bin, and Peggy never again invited bath salts into her routine. While some might argue that she missed out on their promised benefits, Peggy would simply smile. For her, the experience of wafting through a sea of mild-scented bubbles was heady enough, and anything else that dared disturb this precious solitude was not welcome. It was in the simple combination of hot water and bubbles, free of any additional salts, that Peggy found her ultimate comfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is very good at his job, and has a reputation for liking it. His sexual liaisons are casual and rough. When Flowers decides to take over a betting shop, owned by Joey Maddocks (Anthony Valentine), he forbids Chas to get involved, as he feels Chas's complicated personal history with Maddocks (which is at least partly gay) may lead to trouble. Chas is angry about this and later humiliates Maddocks, who retaliates by wrecking Chas's apartment and attacking Chas. Chas shoots him, packs a suitcase and runs from the scene. When Flowers makes it clear that he has no intention of offering protection to Chas but instead wants him eliminated, Chas decides to head for the countryside to hide but instead winds up hiding out in London, requesting that Tony (a trusted friend he refers to as 'Uncle') helps him get out of the country. He assumes a new name, Johnny Dean, and appears at the house of Turner (Mick Jagger), makes a clumsy attempt to ingratiate himself with Pherber (Anita Pallenberg), one of the female inhabitants, and moves in.

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.

Among their remarkable works, they developed Guitar Hero, a notable music rhythm video game, which was subsequently published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2 video game console. This particular game was the first in the 'Guitar Hero' series. Released in North America in November 2005 and later in Europe and Australia in 2006, the development of this game came into realization due to the collaborative efforts between RedOctane and Harmonix. The game was designed to simulate a Guitar Freaks-like game but for an American audience. Guitar Hero incorporated a uniquely-shaped guitar controller, a miniature resemblance of the Gibson SG, to realize the idea of playing rock music.  The gameplay of Guitar Hero shares a similar concept with GuitarFreaks - this involves the player pressing buttons on the guitar controller in sync with the musical notes that appear on the game screen. The game offers a selection of around 30 popular rock songs that were contemporary from the 1960s till 2005, including bonus tracks. Guitar Hero didn't just become a surprise hit but also received critical acclaim, winning multiple awards from major video game publications. This propelled it to become one of the most influential games during the first decade of the 21st century.  The immense success of Guitar Hero paved the way for the development of the 'Guitar Hero' franchise, which has since generated over 2 billion in sales.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Very Serious Bots Henry Farrell looks at an Economist editorial on France and wonders whether any human intelligence was involved: But I do know that this is one of the most exquisitely refined examples of globollocks that I’ve ever seen. It’s as beautifully resistant to the intellect as an Andropov era Pravda editorial. A few more years of this and the Economist won’t have to have any human editing at all. Even today, I imagine that someone with middling coding skills could patch together a passable Economist-editorial generator with a few days work. Mix in names of countries and people scraped from the political stories sections of Google News, with frequent exhortations for “Reform,” “toughminded reform,” “market-led reform,” “painful reform,” “change,” “serious change,” “rupture,” and 12-15 sentences worth of automagically generated word-salad content, and you’d be there. I wonder whether even the writer of this editorial would be able to define ‘reform’ or ‘change’ if he were asked, beyond appealing to some sort of ‘social protection bad, market good’ quasi-autonomic reflex embedded deep in his lizard brain. I also wonder whether the people in there are as cynical about their product as Andropov-era journalists were, or whether they actually believe the pabulum they dish out. I think this question can and should be asked about a lot of what passes for wisdom these days. Summary:","output":"The article discusses Henry Farrell's critique of an Economist editorial on France, questioning the involvement of human intelligence in its creation. Farrell describes the piece as an example of \\"globollocks,\\" comparing it to an Andropov era Pravda editorial.

Here are two sentences: Whitney said officials evacuated a YMCA camp that had been scheduled to host 250 people beginning Sunday . Whitney said officials evacuated a camp where 250 people were expected to arrive Sunday . Do they have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning. They describe a situation in which a camp is being evacuated by officials due to some unspecified reason. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the way they are structured and the details they emphasize, but their core meaning remains the same. In both sentences, we can identify the following key components: 1. Whitney, who is the source of the information in both sentences. 2. The focus on officials being responsible for the evacuation. 3. Mention of a camp in the context of the evacuation. 4. A reference to 250 people being affected or related to the evacuation. 5. The expected date of the people's arrival or beginning of the event, which is Sunday. The first sentence, \\"Whitney said officials evacuated a YMCA camp that had been scheduled to host 250 people beginning Sunday,\\" emphasizes that the camp in question is a YMCA camp and highlights that 250 people were scheduled to be hosted at the camp. The phrasing \\"had been scheduled\\" implies that there was a plan in place for the people to arrive at the camp on Sunday, but the evacuation disrupted that plan. The second sentence, \\"Whitney said officials evacuated a camp where 250 people were expected to arrive Sunday,\\" places more emphasis on the 250 people who were expected to arrive at the camp. The camp is not explicitly identified as a YMCA camp in this sentence, but the core message of the evacuation still remains the same. This sentence also implies that the evacuation disrupted the expected arrival of the 250 people on Sunday. In conclusion, although the two sentences have slightly different structures and details, their core meaning is the same: a camp was evacuated by officials, and this evacuation affected 250 people who were scheduled to be at the camp on Sunday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What facet of evolution by natural selection was highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society? Context: Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation. The answer is:","output":"The facet of evolution by natural selection highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society was the focus on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Unlike Darwin, who emphasized competition between individuals and compared natural selection to artificial selection practiced by animal breeders, Wallace did not draw a comparison to selective breeding and instead concentrated on how ecological factors contributed to the adaptation and survival of various species within their local environments.

Summarize this article: Pte Cheryl James, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995. A pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court was told her body was exhumed last month and metallic fragments had been recovered. A fresh inquest into her death is expected to take place in February. Pte James was one of four young recruits found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. The open verdict recorded at the original inquest held in December 1995 was quashed by High Court judges last year. Coroner Judge Brian Barker QC told the pre-inquest review that Pte James' remains were exhumed and then reburied after two pathologists carried out a post-mortem examination. He said the metallic fragments recovered would be subject to ballistic analysis. The family of Pte James was present during a short reburial ceremony last month, Judge Barker said. They had repeatedly called for her body to be exhumed to resolve a dispute over the ballistics evidence. Alison Foster QC, representing the family, insisted the experts that studied the metallic fragments \\"ought not to have a significant connection either with the MoD [Ministry of Defence] or indeed a police force and certainly no connection with Surrey Police\\" owing to a \\"considerable shadow\\" over the initial handling of the case. Of the MoD and Surrey Police, she added: \\"We make significant criticisms of both.\\" Judge Barker said \\"reasonable progress\\" had been made getting hold of witnesses but urged anyone who had previously given a statement and not been contacted during the inquiry to contact the coroner's court. At a previous hearing, he said the full inquest would consider whether there were \\"shortcomings\\" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation. It is due to begin on 1 February and expected to last for seven weeks. Surrey Police's request that Pte James' inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down in May.","output":"The body of Private Cheryl James, a young soldier who was found dead with a bullet wound to her head in 1995, was exhumed last month and metallic fragments were recovered for further analysis.

The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven.  and a hint : Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Please answer this question : Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","output":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when a gas inside it is heated. This phenomenon can be explained using the Ideal Gas Law and the relationship between temperature, pressure, and volume. The Ideal Gas Law is represented by the equation: PV = nRT where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. When a gas is heated, its temperature (T) increases. In the given situation, the volume (V) of the container is constant because it is a sealed container with a fixed volume. As a result, when the temperature increases, the pressure (P) must also increase to maintain the equilibrium stated in the Ideal Gas Law. This principle is demonstrated in the hint you provided. When the temperature of the gas in the cylinder is increased to 600 K (double the initial temperature of 300 K), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. This causes more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, which results in a doubling of the pressure inside the container. Conversely, if the temperature were decreased, the pressure of the gas in the sealed container would also decrease. Therefore, the pressure of a sealed container will increase when the gas inside it is heated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Title: Dirty Harry Movie plot: A psychopathic serial killer calling himself \\"Scorpio\\" (Andy Robinson) shoots a young woman in a San Francisco swimming pool from a nearby rooftop. SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail message demanding the city pay him 100,000 whilst also promising that for each day his demand is refused he will commit a murder; his next victim will be \\"a Catholic priest or a nigger.\\" The chief of police and the mayor (John Vernon) assign the inspector to the case, despite his reputation for violent solutions. While in a local diner, Callahan observes a bank robbery in progress. He goes outside and kills two of the robbers while wounding a third. Callahan then challenges him: I know what youâre thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, Iâve lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, youâve got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? After the robber surrenders, he tells Callahan that he must know if the gun was still loaded. Callahan pulls the trigger with the weapon pointed directly at the robber, and laughs as it is revealed to be empty. Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do. When Scorpio kills a young black boy from another rooftop, the police believe the killer will next pursue a Catholic priest. Callahan and Gonzalez, wait for Scorpio near a Catholic church, where a rooftop-to-rooftop shootout ensues, with Callahan attempting to snipe Scorpio with a rifle while Scorpio returns fire with a submachine gun. Scorpio escapes, killing a police officer... The answer is:","output":"Callahan and Gonzalez wait for Scorpio near a Catholic church."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Migration in birds is usually influenced by factors such as change in climate, availability of food, or breeding habits, among others. To verify the hypothesis, one would need specific and reliable data on the North African ostrich's migration habits.

Let me clarify the steps leading up to this conclusion: 1. Forest fires burn forests: This results in the destruction of habitats, including flora and fauna. 2. The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide: Due to the loss of their habitats, animals become more vulnerable to threats such as predation and exposure. 3. Predators can now find their prey easier: With less cover, prey species are more easily found and hunted by predators, which could lead to a decline in their population. 4. Birds will fly away from the area: As resources become scarce and threats increase, birds and other species might migrate to other areas in search of better living conditions. Final step: The ecosystem of the forest becomes imbalanced - Due to the cascading effects of forest fires, the overall biodiversity in the area may decrease, and the ecosystem may take a long time to recover or rebalance, if at all.

Drafted by the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, with additional assistance from the country's opposition parties, it was approved by the Parliament on April 10 and ratified on 14 August 1973.  - The Pakistan Navy (reporting name: PN) is the naval warfare branch of the Pakistan Armed Forces, responsible for Pakistan's of coastline along the Arabian Sea, and the defence of important civilian harbours and military bases. The Pakistan Navy came into the existence after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The President of Pakistan serves as the Supreme Commander of the Navy under Article 243 (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan, and the Chief of Naval Staff heads the Navy. Navy Day is celebrated on 8 September in commemoration of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.  - The President of Pakistan ( ), is the ceremonial head of state of Pakistan and a figurehead who represents the \\"unity of the Republic.\\" The President holds the legal title \\"de jure\\" and is a civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces as per the constitution of Pakistan.  - Several nations observe or have observed a Navy Day to recognize their navy.  - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the Erythraean Sea and the Persian Sea. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The Gulf of Aden is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf.  - The Pakistan Armed Forces (\\"Musallah Afwaj-e-Pakistan\\") are the military forces of Pakistan. They are the sixth largest in the world in terms of active military personnel and the largest among Muslim countries. The armed forces comprise three main service branches  Army, Navy, and Air Force  together with a number of paramilitary forces and the Strategic Plans Division Force. Chain of command of the military is organized under the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) alongside chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force. All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions under the Joint Staff Headquarters (JS HQ).  - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.  - From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when maritime nations would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see Outward Bound), sail training provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water.   - PNS Rah Naward is a sail training ship of the Pakistan Navy . She was commissioned in 2001 as Prince William for the Tall Ships Youth Trust and sold in 2010 to the Pakistan Navy and renamed Rah Naward ( \`\` Swift Mover '' ) .

The conflict began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of British India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 20012002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. The war exposed Pakistan's inadequate standards of military training, its misguided selection of officers, poor command and control arrangements, poor intelligence gathering and bad intelligence procedures. In spite of these shortcomings, the Pakistan Army managed to fight the larger Indian Army. Many details of this war, like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars, remain unclear.  - Tall Ships Youth Trust is a sail training organisation in the United Kingdom that currently owns and operates a two mast brig, the \\"Stavros S Niarchos\\", and four 22m/72 ft Challenger class racing yachts.   - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"They will be shut up in cages.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this.\\" true?","output":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\" is true or not, based on the premise \\"They will be shut up in cages,\\" we must first scrutinize various factors associated with both the situation and the individuals or entities being locked away. 1. Context: The nature of the situation plays a crucial role in establishing the validity of the hypothesis. Suppose the scenario deals with animals being locked up in cages for destructive human activities like illegal trading, animal abuse, or entertainment activities that harm their well-being. In that case, the hypothesis could be true. However, if the situation involves locking up animals for public safety reasons or rehabilitation, the hypothesis may be considered incorrect or debatable. 2. Ethical considerations: The morality of the action is significant in determining the truth of the hypothesis. Ethics vary among different individuals and cultures, but the general consensus ascribes specific rights and freedoms to all living beings. If locking away \\"them\\" in cages goes against these ethical standards, one could argue that the hypothesis holds. 3. Justification: The reasons behind \\"them\\" being locked away must be examined closely as well. If they pose a danger to society or themselves, being confined might be necessary for safety reasons. In this case, the hypothesis may not be entirely true. Nonetheless, if the primary reason is purely for exploitation, abuse, or unstructured and harmful experimentation, it can be argued that the hypothesis— \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\"—is true. 4. Alternate solutions: The presence of viable alternatives to this confinement should be considered. If less harmful or restrictive alternatives exist outside of cages, it lends credibility to the idea that they do not deserve to be locked away. However, if no feasible alternatives are available to handle the situation or address the problem, it is challenging to argue for the truth of the hypothesis. 5. Quality of life: Evaluating the living conditions and environment inside the cages is another essential factor in assessing the hypothesis's authenticity. If these cages provide a low quality of life, causing unnecessary distress, suffering, or health degradation, it can support the hypothesis. However, if the life inside the cages is comparable to that outside, or is only a temporary solution addressing a broader issue, it weakens the argument. In conclusion, determining the truth of the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\" heavily depends on the context, ethical considerations, justifications, alternate solutions, and quality of life. These factors must be carefully analyzed to form a well-informed opinion or judgment on the validity of the hypothesis based on the given premise. Since we lack significant information and context behind the premise \\"They will be shut up in cages,\\" it is impossible to assert, with certainty, whether the hypothesis is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

He has also written singles for several other country acts, including No. 1 hits for Randy Travis, Blake Shelton, and Keith Whitley, as well as hits for The Judds and Kenny Chesney.  - Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single \\"Austin\\". The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, \\"Austin\\" spent five weeks at number one on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (\\"All Over Me\\" and \\"Ol' Red\\"). Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.  - Randy Bruce Traywick (born May 4, 1959), better known by his stage name, Randy Travis, is an American country music singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. Since 1985, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs charts, and 16 of these were number-one hits. Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album \\"Storms of Life\\", which sold more than four million copies. The album established him as a major force in the Neotraditional country movement. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. He is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound.  - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions.  - Kenneth Arnold \\"Kenny\\" Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country music singer, songwriter and record producer. He has recorded 20 albums, 14 of which have been certified Gold or higher by the RIAA. He has also produced more than 40 top 10 singles on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, 29 of which have reached number one on the charts. Most of these have also charted high within the top 40 of the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart, making him one of the few successful crossover country artists. He has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.   - Love Is Strong is the title of the fourth studio album by country music artist Paul Overstreet released in 1992 . It produced three singles , \`\` Me and My Baby '' , \`\` Still Out There Swinging '' and \`\` Take Another Run '' . While this album was not as successful as his previous two , \`\` Me And My Baby '' managed to reach the top 40 while the others did n't . The album itself peaked at # 28 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums Chart while only reaching # 60 on the Top Country Albums chart . The song \`\` There But for the Grace of God Go I '' also won a Dove Award for Country Recorded Song of the Year at the 24th GMA Dove Awards in 1993 .  - The Judds were an American country music duo composed of Naomi Judd (born 1946) and her daughter, Wynonna Judd (born in 1964).

One of the most successful acts in country music history, the Judds won five Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and eight Country Music Association awards. The duo also charted twenty-five singles on the country music charts between 1983 and 2000, fourteen of which went to Number One and six more of which made Top Ten on the same chart. In 1985, the duo appeared on the PBS music program \\"Austin City Limits\\" during Season 10. The duo appeared on the PBS children's show \\"Square One TV\\" many times.  - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - Jackie Keith Whitley (July 1, 1954  May 9, 1989), known professionally as Keith Whitley, was an American country music singer. During his career, Whitley charted 19 singles on the \\"Billboard\\" country charts.    What is the relationship between 'love is strong ' and 'rca records'?

Write an article based on this summary: – Shaquille O’Neal is ending his Hall of Fame NBA career—not that he’s told the Celtics. The Big Diesel/Shamrock announced his retirement in a brief video posted online today. “We did it. Nineteen years, baby,” he said. “I want to thank you very much, that’s why I’m telling you first, I’m about to retire.” When ESPN asked why he’d announced it that way, he replied, “Once a businessman, always a businessman. I am the emperor of the social media network.” A Celtics spokesman said O’Neal hadn’t yet told them of his decision, but Rajon Rondo tweeted, “Shout out to @SHAQ on the hall of fame career. One of a kind player.” In an interview with ESPN, Shaq said he was retiring because of his nagging Achilles injury; team doctors said he’d need surgery and a lengthy rehab stint. “I really, really thought about coming back,” he said. But “we’d have the same outcome as this last year—everyone sitting around and waiting for me.” Article:","output":"Shaquille O’Neal Announces Retirement from NBA in Online Video: The End of an Era Shaquille O'Neal, more commonly known as \\"Shaq\\" or \\"The Big Diesel,\\" has officially announced his retirement from his Hall of Fame-worthy NBA career in a short online video posted today. Having played for 19 years in the league, Shaq casually made the announcement, saying, \\"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much, that’s why I’m telling you first, I’m about to retire.\\" This unique, surprising and perhaps fitting way to announce his retirement is a testament to Shaq's innovative approach not just to the game of basketball, but also to self-promotion and marketing. When asked by ESPN about his decision to make the announcement online, Shaq explained, \\"Once a businessman, always a businessman. I am the emperor of the social media network.\\" Although the Boston Celtics, Shaq's most recent team, were not initially informed of his decision, they have since released a statement acknowledging his retirement. Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo also took to Twitter to congratulate Shaq on his phenomenal career, tweeting, \\"Shout out to @SHAQ on the Hall of Fame career. One of a kind player.\\" Shaq's decision to retire stems primarily from his persistent Achilles injury, which would require surgery and an extensive rehabilitation period. Speaking to ESPN, he said, \\"I really, really thought about coming back. But we’d have the same outcome as this last year—everyone sitting around and waiting for me.\\" Shaq has opted to prioritize his long-term health over continuing to play in the NBA, a difficult decision that shows his maturity and wisdom both on and off the court. Over the course of Shaquille O’Neal's remarkable career, he demonstrated exceptional skill, athleticism, and a larger-than-life personality, earning him numerous accolades and records. The 7-foot-1 center was the number one overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic and went on to win Rookie of the Year. During his tenure in the league, Shaq played for the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. Among his most significant achievements, Shaq was a 15-time NBA All-Star, a four-time NBA champion, and a three-time NBA Finals MVP. He was also recognized as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. With a career boasting numerous memorable moments, from his thunderous dunks to his entertaining interviews, Shaq has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the NBA and the world of sports. As Shaquille O’Neal hangs up his basketball sneakers, fans around the world will reflect on the incredible impact he had on the sport. Over the past 19 years, his larger-than-life presence both on and off the court has brought joy, entertainment, and excitement to countless basketball enthusiasts.

Premise: \\"Windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters make a memorable Caribbean snapshot (best from the hillside village of Gosier itself).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\"?","output":"If the given premise is true, that \\"Windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters make a memorable Caribbean snapshot (best from the hillside village of Gosier itself),\\" it provides considerable support for the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\" Let us break down the premise and its implications for the hypothesis. 1. Memorable Caribbean snapshot: The premise implies that the scene of windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters creates a striking and unforgettable image associated with the Caribbean. This suggests that the scene is visually appealing and worthy of being captured in a photograph. Consequently, the hypothesis that the scene makes for a nice photo opportunity is consistent with the premise. 2. Aquamarine waters: The use of the term \\"aquamarine waters\\" to describe the sea in the premise helps establish the setting's aesthetic appeal. Aquamarine is a visually pleasing shade of blue that evokes thoughts of calm, refreshing waters. Thus, the presence of aquamarine waters in the hypothesis reaffirms the idea that the scene would make an attractive photograph. 3. Windsurfers and sailboats: The presence of windsurfers and sailboats in the premise indicates a synergy of human activity and nature, adding an element of excitement to the scene. Sailboats and windsurfers, with their vibrant sails, contribute to the colorful and energetic atmosphere, enhancing the photogenic qualities of the seascape. This detail from the premise is carried over to the hypothesis, lending further support to the idea that the scene presents a nice photo opportunity. 4. Hillside village of Gosier: The premise states that the best view of this scene is from the hillside village of Gosier itself. This detail implies that there is an optimal vantage point from which the scene in question can be photographed. Having an ideal location to shoot from inherently strengthens the hypothesis that the aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make for a nice photo opportunity. In essence, the premise provides ample support for the hypothesis, as it depicts a vibrant and visually enticing scene of aquamarine waters, windsurfers, and sailboats. The specific mention of the hillside village of Gosier as the best vantage point further bolsters the assertion that this scene makes for an appealing photo opportunity. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The Governor, a significant antagonist in the Walking Dead, is a character from the popular comic book series and television show. He is portrayed as the ruthless and cunning leader of the Woodbury community and clashes with Rick Grimes and his group of survivors. The Governor's death is shown differently in the comics and television series, so I will discuss both instances to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding his demise. In the comic series: The Governor, whose real name is Brian Blake, meets his end in issue #48. During an assault on the prison where Rick and the other survivors have established their base, The Governor is ultimately responsible for the death of several characters, including Lori and Judith Grimes. In his attempt to kill Rick and take over the prison, he orders the prison fences to be destroyed, thus allowing hordes of zombies to invade the compound. While The Governor remains focused on successfully capturing the prison, his own people turn against him. During this intense battle, Lilly Caul, one of his Woodbury soldiers, realizes the terrible acts they have been carrying out under The Governor's orders. She becomes outraged after witnessing the deaths of innocent lives, including Lori and Judith. It's during this moment, driven by her anger and desire for justice, that Lilly takes matters into her own hands. She shoots and kills The Governor, thus ending his reign of terror. Following this event, Lilly and other remaining residents of Woodbury join forces with Rick's group to create a stronger community. In the television series: The Governor, played by actor David Morrissey, has a slightly different storyline in the television series, but his ultimate demise is not unlike that depicted in the comic books. After the initial confrontation with Rick's group and the fall of Woodbury, The Governor becomes a fugitive and eventually assumes a new identity as \\"Brian Heriot.\\" He forms a new group and attempts to take over the prison once again. In season 4, episode 8, titled \\"Too Far Gone,\\" The Governor initiates a fierce battle against the prison group. He captures Michonne and Hershel as hostages and demands that Rick's group vacate the compound. Despite Rick's pleas for peace, The Governor is adamant and proceeds to execute Hershel. Seeing this horrific act, Lilly, who was previously involved with The Governor romantically, finally understands the true nature of his malicious intent. While The Governor and Rick engage in a brutal fight, Michonne manages to wound The Governor by stabbing him through his chest with her sword. Michonne lets him suffer instead of finishing him off, as she knows that he is already a dying man. It is then that Lilly steps forward, full of disappointment and anger towards the man she once knew. She delivers the final blow, shooting The Governor in the head and ending his life. This scene highlights the recurring theme of revenge and retribution that permeates the storyline of the Walking Dead and underscores the eventual consequences of The Governor's selfish actions and manipulative tactics. In conclusion, The Governor, a notorious and ruthless antagonist in the Walking Dead, is killed by Lilly Caul.

Question: how does sagebrush effect community idaho I found the following answer on Google: Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing , invasive plant species , wildfires , and climate change . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is generally correct. Sagebrush affects the community in Idaho in several ways, primarily through its impact on the local ecosystem. Sagebrush ecosystems, which are found throughout much of the western United States, including Idaho, provide important habitat for a variety of wildlife, including species such as the Greater Sage-grouse. The threats mentioned in the answer, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing, invasive plant species, wildfires, and climate change, can all have significant impacts on sagebrush ecosystems. These threats can lead to the loss or degradation of the sagebrush habitat, which in turn can affect local communities in a variety of ways. Some potential impacts on communities in Idaho due to changes in sagebrush habitat include: 1. Loss of biodiversity: As sagebrush ecosystems degrade, the species that depend on them are likely to be affected. Loss of local wildlife can have knock-on effects on the broader ecosystem, as well as reducing opportunities for wildlife-related tourism and recreation. 2. Economic impacts: The threats mentioned in the answer can all have economic consequences for communities in Idaho. For example, wildfires can lead to significant property damage and loss, while the practice of converting sagebrush lands to agricultural use can lead to the depletion of soils over time, reducing the productivity of the land. 3. Ecosystem services: Sagebrush ecosystems play an important role in providing a range of ecosystem services, such as water regulation, soil stabilization, and carbon sequestration. As these ecosystems are degraded or lost, the ability of the landscape to provide these services can be compromised, potentially leading to negative consequences for local communities. Overall, the relationship between sagebrush ecosystems and local communities in Idaho can be complex, with a range of potential impacts resulting from changes in these ecosystems. The answer you found on Google offers a good starting point for understanding the threats to sagebrush ecosystems and their potential implications for communities in Idaho."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Birthdays often involve surprises. But this year's surprise on the birthday of the great British playwright William Shakespeare is surely one of the most dramatic. On April 22, one day before his 441st birthday anniversary, experts discovered that one of the most recognizable portraits of William Shakespeare is a fake. This means that we no longer have a good idea of what Shakespeare looked like. \\"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare might be unreliable because many of them are copies of this one,\\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The discovery comes after four months of testing using X-rays, ultraviolet light, microphotography and paint samples. The experts from the gallery say the image --commonly known as the \\"Flower portrait\\"-- was actually painted in the 1800s, about two centuries after Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they also used modern chemistry technology to check the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint dating from about 1814. Shakespeare died in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \\"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was when there was a renewed interest in Shakespeare's plays,\\" Tarnya Cooper, the gallery's curator  , told the Associated President. The fake picture has often been used as a cover for collections of his plays. It is called the Flower portrait because one of its owners, Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"There have always been questions about the painting,\\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture.\\" Two other images of Shakespeare, are also being studied as part of the investigation   and the results will come out later this month. _ Question: What makes the birthday of Shakespeare dramatic this year? Options: A: It was found that he painted a portrait in 1814 instead of in 1609. B: The Flower portrait has been found to be a fake.

Answer:","output":"Sydney decided to paint Alex's nails a shade of pink during their girl's day primarily because she wanted Alex to look good and foster a stronger bond between them through this shared activity. A girl's day usually entails spending quality time together, engaging in activities commonly enjoyed by female friends or family members. By painting Alex's nails, Sydney created an opportunity to not only help her friend look good, but also express her creative side and potentially discover new nail-shades that might suit Alex. This activity allowed them to share their personal preferences in colors and styles, leading to a deeper understanding of each other's tastes. Painting Alex's nails also demonstrated a sense of camaraderie, as it is an activity that they can enjoy together in a relaxed and comfortable environment. Additionally, the process of applying nail polish requires patience and attention, symbolizing the care and commitment Sydney has towards her friend. In this context, it is evident that Sydney painted Alex's nails to enhance her appearance, complementing their girl's day experience. Together, they likely shared laughs, stories, and strengthened the bond of friendship that they share. This nurturing and caring behavior exhibited by Sydney serves as a testament to the close relationship between the two friends and showcases the positive impact they have on each other's lives.

Any successful business depends on a sound marketing strategy that makes the community aware of the great services you will offer. Before you begin advertising, try taking some time and thinking about the information you want to convey. Consider the following:  Think about how you will describe the particular service you plan to offer. How is it different/better than what is already out there? What ages do you serve? What will your hours be? Think about the price you will charge, based on your previous market research, so that you can be competitive with other child-care businesses in the area. Think about the advantages your location offers (great parking, safe, convenient, etc.). If you have staff, think about how to market them as well. What qualifications/certifications/specialities do they bring to your business? You should begin advertising about three months before your child-care business is set to open. If you have the funds, newspaper, radio, and television ads will probably give you the greatest exposure, but these advertising formats do not come cheaply. Consider some of the following, less expensive options as well, even if you can afford more conventional advertising:  Word of mouth. Posting fliers/posters in public spaces in your community (be sure to get permission from the owner of the property/building you plan to put your fliers on first, though!). Distributing brochures/business cards at libraries, church meetings, PTA meetings, neighborhood get-togethers, etc. Placing an ad in the classified section of a local paper. You will also need to decide what, if any, your daily activities will be. Some child-care business offer little structure—they provide supervision and make toys/games/food available for the children to use, but have no set routine or schedule. Others take a more planned approach, with time set aside for playing, learning, napping, etc., based on the ages of the children being cared for. Take some time and think about what you will offer the children for whom you will be caring, and what sort of schedule you will offer. If you are unsure of how to begin, try asking parents in your area what they would like a child-care facility to offer or perhaps how they structure their child's time at home. Summary:","output":"To create a sound marketing strategy for your child-care business, it is essential to consider the following key points: 1. Clarify the unique services you offer, how they differ from existing options, the specific ages you serve, your operational hours, and the prices you intend to charge based on market research. 2. Highlight any advantages your location offers, like easy parking, convenience, and safety, and also showcase any special qualifications or certifications your staff possess. 3. Begin your advertising efforts approximately three months before your business opens and consider utilizing various channels like newspaper, radio, television, as well as cost-effective methods like word of mouth, fliers, brochures, business cards, and local newspapers' classified sections. 4. Engage with parents in your area to understand their preferences and requirements to help you develop a structured daily routine for the children under your care. This schedule should balance playtime, learning, napping, and other age-appropriate activities. Keeping these factors in mind will help you create an impactful marketing campaign that raises awareness about your child-care business in your community, ultimately guiding you on the path to success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Toyota is the world's market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, and one of the largest companies to encourage the mass-market adoption of hybrid vehicles across the globe. Cumulative global sales of Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger car models achieved the 10 million milestone in January 2017. Its Prius family is the world's top selling hybrid nameplate with over 6 million units sold worldwide .  The company was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda in 1937, as a spinoff from his father's company Toyota Industries to create automobiles. Three years earlier, in 1934, while still a department of Toyota Industries, it created its first product, the Type A engine, and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA. Toyota Motor Corporation produces vehicles under five brands, including the Toyota brand, Hino, Lexus, Ranz, and Daihatsu. It also holds a 16.66% stake in Subaru Corporation, a 5.9% stake in Isuzu, as well as joint-ventures with two in China (GAC Toyota and Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor), one in India (Toyota Kirloskar), one in the Czech Republic (TPCA), along with several \\"nonautomotive\\" companies. TMC is part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world.  Toyota is headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a 4-storey building in Toyota. As of 2006, the head office has the \\"Toyopet\\" Toyota logo and the words \\"Toyota Motor\\". The Toyota Technical Center, a 14-story building, and the Honsha plant, Toyota's second plant engaging in mass production and formerly named the Koromo plant, are adjacent to one another in a location near the headquarters. Vinod Jacob from \\"The Hindu\\" described the main headquarters building as \\"modest\\". In 2013, company head Akio Toyoda reported that it had difficulties retaining foreign employees at the headquarters due to the lack of amenities in the city. Answer the following questions: 1. Where is Toyota's headquarters? 2. What city? 3. Are its offices in a skyscraper? 4. What is taller, its headquarters or technical center? 5. By how much? 6. What is that next to? 7.

Why do they have a hard time keeping foreign workers there? 12. How many car companies sell more hybrid vehicles than Toyota?","output":"1. Toyota's headquarters is located in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, in Japan. 2. The city in which Toyota's headquarters is located is named Toyota City, after the company itself. 3. Toyota's offices are not in a skyscraper. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a 4-story building. 4. The Toyota Technical Center is taller than its headquarters. The Technical Center is a 14-story building which is significantly higher than the 4-story building that houses the main headquarters. 5. In terms of storeys, the Toyota Technical Center is taller by 10 floors. This height disparity would obviously be quite substantial, though the specific measurements in feet or meters would depend on the actual construction specifics of each building. 6. The Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant, which is Toyota's second plant engaging in mass production, are next to one another. 7. The Honsha plant, located adjacent to the Toyota Technical Center, used to be called the Koromo plant. 8. The buildings, namely the Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha (formerly Koromo) plant, are not far from the headquarters. They are described as being in a location near the headquarters, implying close proximity.  9. The Toyota headquarters is not usually described as impressive. It is said to be more modest and functional.  10. Vinod Jacob from \\"The Hindu\\" described the main headquarters building as \\"modest,\\" indicating it does not flaunt excessive grandeur or luxury while still being well-suited to its purpose.  11. Toyota has a hard time keeping foreign workers at their headquarters due to the lack of amenities in Toyota City. Akio Toyoda, the company's head in 2013, reported on this, implying the city might not offer the sort of facilities, attractions, or cosmopolitan lifestyle that might appeal to overseas employees. 12. As it stands, Toyota is the world's market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, meaning no other car companies sell more hybrid vehicles than Toyota. Its successful hybrid car models like the Prius have achieved impressive sales milestones, racking up millions of units sold worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Constantinople on February 8, 412 AD, Proclus went on to leave a lasting impact on the world of philosophy. Influenced by great philosophers such as Plotinus, Aristotle, Plato, Plutarch, and Syrianus, Proclus embarked on a journey to understand and expand upon their ideas. His work primarily focused on Neoplatonism, a school of thought that blended Plato's philosophies with religious and mystical elements, emphasizing the hierarchical structure of reality and the role of the One as the source of all existence. Throughout his life, Proclus studied under various philosophers and scholars, eventually settling in Athens, the heart of ancient philosophy and learning. While in Athens, he became the head of the Platonic Academy, an influential institution founded by Plato himself. Proclus's teachings and work, in turn, influenced a myriad of future philosophers and scholars such as Damascius, Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, Pseudo-Dionysius, Ammonius Hermiae, Marinus, Marsilio Ficino, and St. Thomas. His ideas resonated through the ages, impacting medieval Christian thought and the development of Western philosophy. Proclus passed away in Athens on April 17, 485 AD, leaving behind a rich legacy of philosophical contributions that have influenced thinkers across various eras and traditions.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.  I am facing a new situation today: David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B?

Add 1/2 cup of 7 Up to an almost full vase of cold water, insert your flowers, this will preserve the flowers. The reason why adding 1/2 cup of 7 Up to an almost full vase of cold water is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning is that 7 Up contains sugar and a little bit of citric acid. The sugar provides the cut flowers with some nutrition, helping them to stay fresh for a longer time, while the citric acid helps to lower the pH of the water, which can prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and improve the flowers' water uptake. On the other hand, buttermilk is not an ideal solution for preserving cut flowers. Buttermilk contains lactic acid, which doesn't provide the appropriate pH for cut flowers and may lead to bacterial growth in the water, ultimately shortening the flowers' lifespan."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer this question: what is the abbreviation for an element called??","output":"An abbreviation for an element is commonly referred to as an element symbol or chemical symbol. Element symbols are composed of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet, and they are an abbreviated representation of an element's name. They are used universally in various fields such as chemistry, physics, and engineering, as a means to easily identify and communicate different elements, their properties, and interactions. The chemical symbols for elements are standardized by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), which is the globally recognized authority that ensures the consistency and accuracy of chemical nomenclature, symbols, and units. The first letter of an element symbol is always capitalized, while the second letter, if present, is lowercase. This standardization allows scientists and researchers from all over the world to effectively communicate and understand the specific elements being referred to, regardless of their languages or backgrounds. For example, some common element symbols and their corresponding elemental names are as follows: 1. H = Hydrogen 2. O = Oxygen 3. Na = Sodium 4. Cl = Chlorine 5. Au = Gold (from Latin 'Aurum') 6. Ag = Silver (from Latin 'Argentum') Many chemical symbols are derived from the English element names, but some are based on their Latin, Greek, or German names, which originated from the historical context in which they were discovered or their properties and characteristics. In chemical formulas, these symbols are conveniently used to represent elements involved in chemical reactions and to show the composition of compounds and molecules. The symbols are combined with numbers, called subscripts, which indicate the relative ratio of atoms of different elements in a compound. For instance, the chemical formula for water is H2O, which means it consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. In conclusion, the abbreviation for an element is called an element symbol or chemical symbol and plays a critical role in conveying information accurately and efficiently within the scientific community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Terrified of water and screaming at the sound of rain, they were just some of the thousands of children whose lives were devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. Crammed into tents, many were mute and in shock after losing their entire families and seeing their villages flattened and flooded. For Nizma Scoffield there was only one option, to set up an orphanage to give as many children as possible, marooned by the tsunami and without any relatives, a home. Nizma Scoffield (right) has helped raise 100 orphans who lost all their families after the Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia 10 years ago, including Nina (left) who was just 10 when she lost her mother to the devastation The home runs off donations of around £600 a month - which provides food, shelter and tuition for the","output":"children - and has since evolved into a thriving community and safe haven for these young survivors. Nizma Scoffield, driven by her compassion and determination, took on the monumental task of not only providing these children with a roof over their heads but also working tirelessly to help them heal from the unspeakable trauma they had experienced. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, which claimed the lives of more than 230,000 people across 14 countries, aid organizations from around the world arrived to provide relief in the form of food, water, and medical supplies. However, with countless children left orphaned, it was clear that longer-term solutions were needed to care for and support these young victims. This is where Nizma's vision for her orphanage took root. Initially, the orphanage was set up in a temporary location, providing basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter for the children. As the number of orphans grew, Nizma searched for ways to secure permanent land and facilities to ensure their long-term care and education. This was no easy task, as funding and resources were scarce in the wake of the disaster. However, thanks to the generosity of donors and the unwavering support of volunteers and community members, the orphanage was eventually established in a permanent location. Today, the orphanage has become a vital sanctuary for these children, offering much more than just their basic needs. Along with providing housing, food, and clothing, the orphanage emphasizes education and personal development, ensuring that the children have the tools and resources they need to overcome their pasts and eventually lead successful, fulfilled lives. Through the ongoing support of the staff and volunteers, the children have been nurtured and guided back to a sense of normalcy despite the trauma. Many have even gained the courage to face their fears of water and rain, taking part in swimming lessons and activities that promote both mental and physical healing. Alongside their formal education, the children at the orphanage also receive psychological support to help them cope with their grief and loss. The team of dedicated caregivers and therapists work closely with the children to address the emotional scars left by the tsunami, using various therapeutic techniques and activities that encourage self-expression and emotional release. Moreover, the orphanage also strives to help the children maintain a connection to their cultural heritage and traditions. By cultivating a sense of community and preserving their shared history, the orphans are able to develop a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for their emotional healing and self-esteem. Over the past ten years, Nizma Scoffield's orphanage has saved the lives and restored hope to over 100 children who lost everything in the Boxing Day tsunami. Thanks to her unwavering commitment and the dedication of her team, these children have been given a second chance at life and the opportunity to grow into strong, resilient adults. As the orphanage continues to thrive and fulfill its mission, it stands as a testament to the power of human compassion and the importance of providing care, support, and hope to those who have lost so much. Through the efforts of Nizma Scoffield and her team, the orphans can now face their futures with strength, confidence, and optimism, knowing that they have a loving and supportive community to guide them every step of the way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason Isbell released his first solo album, Sirens of the Ditch, on July 10, 2007. In 2012, Isbell supported singer-songwriter Ryan Adams on his tour. Both played solo acoustic sets.  On June 11, 2013, Isbell released his fourth solo album, Southeastern. Produced by Dave Cobb and featuring accompanying vocals by Kim Richey and Isbell's wife, Amanda Shires, Southeastern received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews, earning a score of 87 on Metacritic. Southeastern led to Isbell's clean sweep of the 2014 Americana Music Awards. Southeastern won Album of the Year, Isbell was named Artist of the Year, and the song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was named Song of the Year. NPR rock critic Ken Tucker listed Southeastern at No. 1 on his top ten albums of 2013. Isbell's record received praise by artists like Bruce Springsteen and John Prine. Isbell's music video for the song \\"Traveling Alone\\" features the Jackson House, a historic home in Moulton, Alabama. In 2014, his song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was used as the weather for the Welcome to Night Vale episode \\"Visitor\\".  Isbell's fifth solo record, Something More Than Free, was released on July 17, 2015, on Southeastern Records. Dave Cobb produced, continuing the partnership created with Isbell on Southeastern. They recorded the album at Nashville's Sound Emporium studio with a full band. During the summer of 2015, Isbell was on a North American tour to promote the album, with four consecutive sold-out nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville at the end of October. In April 2016, Isbell appeared on the BBC live-music show Later With Jools Holland, singing \\"The Life You Chose\\", one of the tracks from Something More Than Free.  Isbell said that compared to Southeastern, Something More Than Free has a feeling of celebration, which reflects his upcoming fatherhood and a forward-facing momentum. One track on the record, \\"To a Band I Loved\\", is a love-letter to the band Centro-Matic, a now defunct band from Denton, Texas, Isbell played with back in his Drive-By Truckers days.  Something More Than Free debuted at number 1 on Billboard Magazine's rock, folk and country record charts. Although Isbell had had critical success in the Americana genre, this was the first time he received such high ranking across genres. The album was well received, winning two Grammy awards for Best Americana Album and Best American Roots Song (\\"24 Frames\\"). On May 11, 2016, Isbell, a four-time winner, was nominated for three more Americana Music Honors & Awards: Album of the Year (Something More Than Free), Song of the Year (\\"24 Frames\\"), and Artist of the Year. He won the first two, while Chris Stapleton won Artist of the Year.

Answer the following question: Process:  - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur.  suppose less stormy weather happens, how will it affect more roots occur.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's break down the steps and think about how less stormy weather would affect each of them: 1. A plant grows near or on a rock - Less stormy weather might provide more favorable conditions for plant growth, allowing plants to establish themselves near or on rocks. 2. The plant roots begin to grow - With better growing conditions due to less stormy weather, plant roots might have a higher chance of growing and penetrating the rock. 3. Break apart the rock - As more roots grow and penetrate the rock, the rock will be broken apart more effectively. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - This process would still occur as plants do this naturally, regardless of weather conditions. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - As more roots grow, rocks are broken into more pieces due to the combination of root growth and plant acids dissolving the rock. 6. Erosion starts to occur - Although less stormy weather may reduce the overall rate of erosion from weather-related factors, the rock is still being broken down through the biological processes outlined above. As we analyze the relationship between less stormy weather and the process of roots breaking rocks, it seems that less stormy weather indirectly impacts a step of the process. The more favorable growing conditions provided by less stormy weather can lead to more significant root growth, indirectly leading to more effective rock breakdown and erosion. Therefore, the supposed perturbation is: - indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Brett Morse, 28, has competed at two Commonwealth Games, two World Championships and the London 2012 Olympics. The Penarth product is aiming to regain his British title this weekend in Birmingham. The national championships acts as a trial for the World Championships, which will be held in London on 4-13 August. In the winter, Morse has also been moonlighting as a model to help him fund his athletics adventure. Injury and loss of form meant Morse lost his British Athletics financial support in November 2014 and he has had to look at other methods of funding. After someone spotted a picture Morse had posted on social media, an unlikely call came to help continue his sporting dream. \\"It's crazy and if someone had told me I would be modelling five years ago I would have laughed,\\" said Morse. \\"I didn't care about my appearance. \\"I had a photo shoot before the last Commonwealth Games and posted some pictures of that. \\"An agency rang me to see if I would be interested in doing it as a job. \\"I thought it was a joke at first and they were winding me up a bit. \\"I read the contract and there were no crazy clauses. \\"The next thing I know I was the face of a 'River Island' campaign a week later. \\"It's been cool. It's a crazy world completely different to anything I have thought about doing in the past. \\"I have met some good people and got to travel. Most of the shoots have been in the UK but I had five days in Madrid. \\"I am modelling clothes for different brands and I have been put up for some television adverts.\\" \\"It is very different to discus throwing! \\"Modelling is not as organised and I could get a call now saying I need to be there tomorrow whereas athletics is not like that. \\"Sometimes it's nice to take your mind of athletics and it opens different doors.\\" Morse admitted his new career has received mixed reviews among his family and friends. \\"There has been a lot of banter,\\" said Morse. \\"There have been a lot of old pictures emerging of me on social media of when I was young with three middle teeth and I was out of shape. \\"They find it hilarious, especially my sister, but that's what family and friends are for and I would be doing the same to them.\\" The serious side is that the modelling has helped Morse continue his athletics dream alongside his part-time work in a gym in Penarth. \\"I was funded as an athlete but that stopped in 2014,\\" he said. \\"There are no excuses and I understand performance targets have to be hit, which I didn't. \\"I have had to fund myself although I do have some support from Sport Wales and Welsh Athletics. \\"That is not enough to live on and I have been a normal person as well as trying to be a full-time professional athlete. \\"I worked full-time for a great company for two years and this modelling thing came along. \\"I was able to pack that in and give athletics one last shot. \\"I am not a full-time athlete but I have that mindset.\\" Morse will swap the photo shoot for the discus cage on Saturday in Birmingham as he looks to regain his British title and at least throw an A standard ahead of the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next April. Morse will compete in the first event on the two-day competition on Saturday, 1 July. \\"My aim to to regain the title I lost last year because that was hard to take,\\" said Morse. \\"If I replicate my training performances in competition I will win. \\"We will see how this weekend goes. If I can throw a season's best by a couple of metres I will be on track. \\"I would love to go to London and compete in a World Championships. \\"The Commonwealth Games has been more my focus because there is something special about representing Wales. \\"It has the world number three [Fedrick Dacres] from Jamaica, so it's going to be a high-class competition and I am looking for a medal. \\"If I don't throw a Commonwealth Games A standard in the next month I will be surprised.\\" Morse's efforts could eventually be superseded by his younger brother Jay, who does not turn 16 until July but tops the Great Britain Under-17 discus rankings and lies second in the shot putt. The pair competed against each other in the recent Welsh Athletics Championships. \\"He is very talented,\\" said Morse snr. \\"I believe he can throw a lot further than I could. \\"His physical attributes are better and he is mentally much stronger than I was at that age. \\"He is very driven and already talking about going to university in America.\\"","output":"Brett Morse is a 28-year-old athlete who has been in big competitions like the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics.

Question: Millions of people die of hunger in southern Africa every year, but when Zambia was offered thousands of tons of free maize by the US, the government politely said no. \\"We don't know whether the food is safe,\\" said Zambia's commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Dipak Patel. His worries are shared by countries around the world that are in two minds about America's genetically modified(GM,)crops.Just last week, EU member nations were discussing whether or not to import GM sweet corn from the US. Ever since people started farming, they have tried to crossbreed plants to make them stronger or better tasting. At one time, only related plants could be crossed with each other. But when GM techniques were developed in the 1970s, scientists were able to put a single gene from a living creature into an unrelated creature. This means they can make crops more productive and resistant to disease by adding genes from other species.They can also create food with special characteristics, such as \\"golden rice\\", which is enriched with vitamin A. But many people believe GM foods are a health risk. At the moment, the official argument is that GM foods \\"are not likely to present risks for human health\\". But there are still many questions to be answered as the foods are produced in different ways. Some experts believe the genetic material added to plants can transfer to humans and give damage to our bodies. Further harm could be caused by the genes from GM plants crossbreeding with naturally produced crops. People in China are also getting worried about GM foods. More than 70 percent of the country's soybean oil is produced from imported GM soybeans. Meanwhile, an investigation last November found that 12 of 60 famous foods sold across the country were GM products. The government has begun to introduce a marking system for GM goods so that people can choose whether or not to eat them. Which is the best title for the passage?

When these tiny plants fall to the ground, they take root and become new plants. This process is an example of Available choices: (1). sexual reproduction (2). asexual reproduction (3). evolution (4). extinction","output":"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given information and understand the differences between the available choices. 1. Sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parent organisms to create offspring. This requires male and female components (usually sperm and egg) to fuse and create a new organism. 2. Asexual reproduction refers to the process where a single organism creates offspring identical to itself without any fusion of gametes. This can happen through several mechanisms, such as budding, fragmentation, or binary fission. 3. Evolution is the gradual change in the inherited traits of a species over time, driven by natural selection and other factors. This process results in the formation of new species or changes to existing ones. 4. Extinction refers to the disappearance of a species when the last of its individuals dies out, usually due to environmental pressures or competition with other species. Now let's analyze the given information: A plant produces tiny plants around the edges of its leaves, and when these tiny plants fall to the ground, they take root and become new plants. This suggests that there is no involvement or combination of genetic material from two parent organisms, meaning it is not sexual reproduction. Furthermore, there's no indication of gradual change over time or extinction of a species. Based on this, the correct answer is (2). asexual reproduction, as the given process involves production of new offspring from a single parent organism without the fusion of gametes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise states that \\"Two women have a seat in a busy metropolitan area.\\" The term \\"metropolitan area\\" is another phrase commonly used to describe a densely populated urban locality or a city and its surrounding regions that form a functional economic and social unit.

I heard that Ash was tested for a breast cancer gene, so Ash reduced their risk by getting a mastectomy.  And I was wondering Why did Ash do this?","output":"Ash decided to undergo a mastectomy after being tested for the breast cancer gene to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Here is a step-by-step justification for Ash's decision: 1. Ash got tested for the breast cancer gene: Undergoing genetic testing can reveal whether a person has certain gene mutations that increase their risk of developing breast cancer. The most common genes associated with breast cancer risk are BRCA1 and BRCA2. 2. Positive test results: If Ash tested positive for a breast cancer gene mutation, it means they have a higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to the general population. Depending on the specific mutation, the risk could be significantly higher. 3. Weighing the options: After receiving the test results, Ash likely consulted with healthcare professionals to discuss their options to minimize their risk. This might include increased cancer screening, lifestyle changes, medications, or preventive surgery such as a mastectomy. 4. Decision to undergo a mastectomy: A mastectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both breasts, usually as a preventative measure for individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer. By removing breast tissue, the procedure significantly reduces the risk of developing breast cancer in the future. 5. Assessing the benefits and risks: Ash probably considered the potential benefits of a mastectomy, such as reduced cancer risk and possibly decreased anxiety about developing cancer. They would also have considered the risks and potential complications of the surgery, as well as its emotional impact. 6. Making an informed decision: After considering all the available information and discussing it with healthcare professionals, Ash decided to undergo a mastectomy to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. This choice demonstrates that Ash prioritized their long-term health and wanted to take proactive measures to protect themselves. In summary, Ash underwent a mastectomy as a preventive measure after testing positive for a breast cancer gene mutation. By doing so, they significantly reduced their risk of developing breast cancer in the future. This decision was likely based on careful consideration of all available options and consultation with healthcare professionals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

O'Fallon, Missouri (CNN) -- Nathan Halbach is 22, with a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer. He knows that \\"horrible stuff\\" lies ahead. His mother, Pat Bond, has been taking care of him full time. But when she needed help, she reached out to the Roman Catholic Church. After all, his father is a priest. Nathan was born in 1986, during a five-year affair between his mother and Father Henry Willenborg, the Franciscan priest who celebrated Nathan's baptism. In a story first reported in the New York Times, it was revealed that The Franciscan Order drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality.

This stems from the fact that the narrative of the story involves relationships between Nathan's mother, Pat Bond, and Father Henry Willenborg.

Furthermore, the statement also includes denial of inappropriate relationships with other women which is a potential issue for a priest.

Breast internet craze yet? Mamming is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects. Popular: The idea began in New York thanks to Michelle Lamont and Michelle Jaret but is now sweeping the internet. Objective: The creators hope the craze will become as big as planking or owling. Aged just 25, Michelle Lamont is a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease. Now ad agency executive Michelle, from New York, has seen her idea go global as more and more people take to the internet to post their 'mamming' poses. She said: ‘Overall the response has been very positive, although there have been some people wondering how a campaign like this is going to “cure” breast cancer. Clean act: The idea is to keep things 'PG' and not bare too much flesh. Chest file it: The photographs are all sent to thisismamming.com which urges people to 'embrace the awkwardness' The creators wanted to break through the clutter of Breast Awareness Month. ‘When I was sick, I asked my doctors about a cure - one actually told me that the best cure we have is prevention. ‘Prevention is screening like mammograms and self-exams and they are the best tool we have to catch cancer early, and catching it early is how we beat it. ‘We would love to see mamming become as big on the web as planking and owling. Part of the reason that we love mamming as a vehicle for spreading awareness is because it taps into an existing trend that is really fun and relevant to everyone. The creators of mamming say that it taps into an existing trend - and is great fun. The creator of the mamming initiative (not pictured) was a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease. Bra-vo: This mamming participant has decided to post a rather fruity picture. Mam's the word: The photographs are a way of women showing solidarity with those having to have mammograms. ‘Our goal was to create something fun that would break through the clutter of breast cancer awareness month. We've seen breast cancer awareness campaigns that use humour and sexuality, and ones that don't mention mammograms or breasts at all. ‘We wanted to do something that focused on the woman as being responsible for her breasts and her health. Overall, we hope that mamming reminds women to get screened, and maybe makes them feel a little less awkward about putting their boobs in the mammogram machine. ‘We hope people will keep it PG, but the only real rule is to make your mam awesome.

This information is essential to understanding whether there may still be a chance for the album to be considered for an award in the future. Step 2: Understand the eligibility period for Grammy Awards To be eligible for a Grammy Award, the music must have been released between specific dates. According to The Recording Academy, the typical eligibility period is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.  Step 3: Determine if Now That's What I Call Music! 59 was eligible for any Grammy Awards Since the album was released on August 5, 2016, it would have been eligible for the 59th Annual Grammy Awards (2017), as it falls within the eligibility period of October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. Step 4: Check if Now That's What I Call Music! 59 has already been nominated or won a Grammy Award There is no record of Now That's What I Call Music! 59 being nominated or winning a Grammy Award at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards or any subsequent ceremonies. Step 5: Analyze the likelihood of winning a Grammy in the future As a compilation album, Now That's What I Call Music! 59 has already been eligible for the Grammy Awards during its eligibility period but did not receive a nomination or win. Grammy Awards are awarded to new music released within specific eligibility periods, meaning an album released in 2016 would not be considered for future ceremonies.

They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers.

Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers.

Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\".

Dan takes his guitar to a pawn shop to get money for food, leaving Jan alone in the woods. As she sits there, she laments how she'd give anything to be a rock star, feeling that if she was one, people would listen to her music.Suddenly, the Earth shakes, and in a puff of smoke, a large, red-skinned creature appears, clad in a white suit. He presents Jan with his card, which claims him to be B.L. Zebub, the head of 'Devil May Care Productions.' B.L. then introduces his assistant, Wheez Weasel, who shows Jan a contract. However, the enormous amount of paperwork leaves Jan's head spinning, and she decides to sign without having thoroughly read the paperwork. After signing in her own blood, Jan is taken from the wooded area, just as Dan comes back.Wheez is put in charge of managing Jan, and conjures a band up for her. Jan's musical career spans several different music styles, and soon, she has amassed fame and fortune, and is one of the most talked-about performers on stage. Dan continues to try and see her, but is foiled at every turn by Wheez.At an outdoor amphitheater at the height of her fame, Jan performs several different genres of music, before the moon overhead is blotted out by a large bird, which happens to be B.L., come to collect her.Jan rushes out of the amphitheater, with B.L. following her and changing shape depending on where she goes. When he finally catches her, he explains the clause in her contract that states that her soul now belongs to him, given that she has achieved superstardom. Jan then points out that this takes effect at midnight,... Answer:","output":"Jan"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea.  But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

It belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages. Your text in Russian says: \\"17 For behold, at present they are planning to destroy the freedom of the people, (for thus says the Lord) which goes against the statutes, laws and commandments that He gave to His people.\\" The Russian language uses the Cyrillic script, and due to its usage in the former Soviet Union, it also has significant speakers in various Eastern European and Central Asian countries. Additionally, Russian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Russian is fairly complex, particularly in its grammatical structure, with complex case systems for nouns, pronouns, and numerals, and a verb-aspect system. Also, it has a rich vocabulary, and its literature is celebrated worldwide, with authors such as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov contributing important works to world literature.  In terms of phonetics, Russian is known for its range of vowel phonation, allowing for a distinct variety of sounds and intonations. It also has a stress system that can significantly alter the meaning of words. The vocabulary and syntax of the Russian language have been influenced by other languages, including Greek, Latin, French, German, and English, among others.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Both individuals are in their mid-to-late teenage years, with a current height of 5'6\\" and are inquiring about the possibility of reaching a height of 5'8\\" or 5'9\\". However, some key differences between the two questions are the age of the individuals and the way they are phrased. In the first question, the individual is a 17-year-old male who wishes to know if they can reach a height of 5'8\\" or 5'9\\". The second question, on the other hand, is posed by a 16-year-old individual who has not specified their gender and is asking if they can \\"gow\\" (which seems to be a typo for \\"grow\\") to 5'9\\". Although these differences exist in the questions, the core concern remains the same, which is the potential for growth in height during their teenage years. To address the question, it is still possible for both individuals to grow taller, as many people continue to grow in height until they are about 18-21 years old. However, it is important to note that height is largely determined by genetics, and there are no guarantees that they will achieve their desired height. Various factors can influence an individual's height, including: 1. Genetics: The genetic makeup inherited from one's parents is a key determinant of how tall a person is likely to become. If the majority of the family members are tall, then the likelihood of reaching a taller height could be higher. 2. Nutrition: A well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals is vital for growth. Proper nutrition during childhood and teenage years can significantly impact one's height. 3. Physical activity: Engaging in regular physical activities can help promote healthier bone growth and overall muscle development. Sports and exercises that focus on stretching, jumping, and resistance training can potentially enhance growth. 4. Hormones: Growth hormones play an essential role in determining an individual's height. Any imbalances or deficiencies in these hormones can impact growth, and in some cases, medical intervention may be needed. 5. Sleep: Adequate sleep is necessary for overall growth and development. Human growth hormones are released during sleep, so it's crucial to maintain a healthy sleep schedule. It's essential to remember that everyone grows at different rates, and there can be growth spurts even in later teenage years. While it may be possible for both the 17-year-old male and the 16-year-old individual to grow taller, ultimately, factors such as genetics, nutrition, and overall health will determine their final height. It is important to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle to ensure the best outcome and accept oneself for who they are, regardless of height."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What type of details about roy conrad  can be gathered from the following bio?

Q:Information:  - Flint corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"indurata\\"; also known as Indian corn or sometimes calico corn) is a variant of maize, the same species as common corn. Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name.  - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions.  - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals.  - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair.  - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor .  - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.  - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world.  - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour.  - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.  - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO.  - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family.  - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.

Russia wants the ability to censor the internet - but the U.S. plans to stonewall the plans at a U.N. conference later this year. Russia says it wants wants the right to block access where it is used for 'interfering in the internal affairs, or undermining the sovereignty,. national security, territorial integrity and public safety of other. states, or to divulge information of a sensitive nature'. The member nations of the United Nations will gather this December to create a treaty for the World Conference on International Telecommunications - and Russia has already made it clear which way it wants the internet to develop. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long called for a centralised control of the internet. Internet block: President Vladimir Putin, right, pictured taking part in a wreath laying ceremony this morning, wants centralised control of the web. The U.S. delegation has vowed to block any proposals from Russia and other countries that they. believe threaten the internet's current governing structure or give. tacit approval to online censorship. But those assurances have failed to ease fears that bureaucratic tinkering with the treaty could damage the world's most powerful engine for exchanging information, creating jobs and even launching revolutions. Examples of where the internet has acted as a voice for change include when social networks played a key role in the Arab Spring uprisings that last year upended regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. The wording of Russia's provision for the treaty allow a country to repress political opposition while citing a U.N. treaty as the basis for doing so. The provision also appears to contradict Article 19 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says people shall have the right to access information 'through any media and regardless of frontiers.' An amended treaty would be binding on the United States if it is ratified by the Senate. But approval is not automatic. The treaty is sure to be scrutinised by lawmakers wary of its potential impact. The U.N.'s International Telecommunication Union, which oversees the treaty, does not operate like the U.N. Security Council, where the United States has the power to veto resolutions to which it objects. The ITU works on a consensus basis. Proposals can be stopped from serious consideration if enough countries voice their objections. A global concern: Protesters from the Anonymous India group in Mumbai of hackers wear Guy Fawkes masks as they protest against laws they say gives the government control over internet usage. More than 190 nations will attend the Dubai conference and the U.S. delegation is seeking support for its positions at the preparatory meetings that will continue until the conference convenes. 'It is important that when we have values, as we do in the area of free speech and the free flow of information, that we do everything that we can to articulate and sustain those values,' Philip Verveer, deputy assistant secretary of state and U.S. coordinator for international communications and information policy, said in an interview. The drafting and debating of proposals in preparation for the Dubai conference have taken place largely behind closed doors. Public interest groups have criticised the process and said it runs counter to development of sound public policy. In response to calls for transparency, two research fellows at George Mason University's Mercatus Center launched the website WCITLeaks.org earlier this month as a way to make documents that have been leaked to them by anonymous sources available publicly. The negotiations have sparked rumors that the U.N. and the ITU are plotting to take control of the Internet from the loose coalition of nongovernmental organizations that establishes Internet policies, standards and rules, they said. Tents and protesters during a sit-in against the delay of the Egyptian presidential results and the military rulers, today: Protesting would be much harder with a censored web. The ITU's secretary general, Hamadoun Toure, has called the takeover rumor 'ridiculous.' The ITU said the preparatory process is open to all member states as well as hundreds of private sector and academic organizations. The member states, not the ITU, determine the rules of participation and are free to share documents and information as they see fit, the agency said in an emailed statement. Several. lawmakers questioned Verveer, who also testified, and McDowell about. the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Toure, the. ITU's secretary general. Their. fear is that Putin, who long has pushed for centralised control of the. Internet, will use his allegedly close ties to Toure to accomplish that. goal. Toure, a native of. Mali, received advanced degrees in electronics and telecommunications. from universities in Moscow and Leningrad. 'Is. this relationship a concern?' asked Republican Rep. Greg Walden, the. subcommittee's chairman. 'What steps are we taking to be able to. counterbalance that relationship?' Verveer told Walden he has no doubts about Toure's honesty and fairness. But. McDowell struck a more ominous tone. Putin's 'designs' need to be taken. very seriously, he said, and urged proponents of Internet freedom to be. on guard for 'camouflaged subterfuge' that could threaten the. Internet's future. The treaty, known formally as the International Telecommunications Regulations, was developed in 1988 to deal with global telephone and telegraph systems that were often state-run. The conference in Dubai, which is being held by the ITU, will be the first time in 20 years that the treaty is being opened for revisions. Independent organizations, including the Internet Society, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Worldwide Web Consortium, for years have served as the Internet's governing bodies. They handle core tasks like network and domain name administration and make decisions based on input from the public and private sectors. This system allows the Internet to evolve organically and rapidly to changes in technology, business practices and consumer behavior, according to open Internet advocates. Yet countries still grappling with how communications have been transformed by the Internet view the ITU and the treaty as the best avenues for plugging themselves into the global information economy. For developing nations that don't have an effective broadband infrastructure, bureaucratic and regulatory measures can allow them to benefit financially from the traffic that crosses their borders. But treaties are static instruments that often are unable to adapt and adjust to the fast pace of Internet innovation, said Sally Shipman Wentworth, senior manager for public policy at the nonprofit Internet Society. 'Further, we do not believe that we should simply take the 1988 regulatory model that applied to the old telephone system and apply it to the Internet,' she said. A proposal offered by a European association of telecommunications network operators would put pressure on content providers such as Google, Facebook and Netflix to offset the costs of delivering Internet traffic to end-users. Traffic increasingly includes bandwidth-hungry video, and the proposal from the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association essentially argues that the investment needed to expand and improve the transfer of data should be borne by the operators and the content providers. Verveer called the proposal unworkable. and said it would have unintended consequences, such as blocking. Harvard, MIT and other universities from putting courses online at no. cost to users in places where access to education is already limited. 'If. it became necessary to pay in order to make these courses available,. they would predictably become less available, which would be very. unfortunate,' he said. The. threat to Internet freedom won't come in the form of a 'full-frontal. assault,' Roger McDowell, a Republican member of the Federal. Communications Commission, said at a congressional hearing last month,. 'but through insidious and seemingly innocuous expansions of. intergovernmental powers.' His warning resonated with members of the House Energy and Commerce communications and technology subcommittee. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses Russia's plans to have the ability to censor the internet and the US's intention to stonewall these plans at a U.N. conference. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has consistently called for centralized control of the internet. The US delegation plans to block any proposals from Russia and other countries that threaten the internet's current governing structure or enable online censorship. The member nations of the United Nations will gather in December 2012 to create a treaty for the World Conference on International Telecommunications. The article highlights concerns about an amended treaty potentially damaging the world's most powerful engine for exchanging information, creating jobs, and launching revolutions. The article also mentions how the internet has acted as a voice for change, such as with the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, and raises concerns about Russia's censorship plans potentially contradicting Article 19 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which ensures people's rights to access information \\"through any media and regardless of frontiers.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons. As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as Stoller put it, \\"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\\" At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \\"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\\"  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the band that preachers frequently objected?

Their performances, particularly bass singer Jim Wetherington's ceaseless jiggling of his legs, caused quite a stir among the audience, leading to reactions of screams and swoons. However, their daring performance style didn't sit well with the preachers due to what they perceived as lewd movements. Despite the criticism, the Statesmen Quartet's influence certainly had a profound effect on young Elvis Presley, sowing seeds for his future stage act and contributing to his broad understanding of various musical idioms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - The Volkswagen Beetle (officially the Volkswagen Type 1, informally in Germany the Volkswagen Käfer, in Poland the Volkswagen Garbus and in the U.S. the Volkswagen Bug) is a two-door, four passenger, rear-engine economy car manufactured and marketed by German automaker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003.  - The Love Bug (sometimes referred to as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American comedy film and the first in a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions that starred an anthropomorphic pearl-white, fabric-sunroofed 1963 Volkswagen racing Beetle named Herbie. It was based on the 1961 book \\"Car, Boy, Girl\\" by Gordon Buford.  - Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing or automobile racing) is a sport involving the racing of automobiles for competition.   - In sport, racing is a competition of speed, against an objective criterion, usually a clock or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.  - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car.  - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

Here is a detailed answer on how to break down the process of translation: 1. Analyzing the structure and content of the sentence: The given sentence is organized with the conjunction \\"but\\" at the beginning, followed by the main subject-verb-object structure that contains a dependent clause introduced by the word \\"that.\\" The sentence talks about the accumulation of results and the capacity of human beings to reach the truth. 2. Understanding the meaning and specifics of each word and phrase: - But: The sentence starts with a conjunction, which implies a contrast or contradiction to a previous statement or idea. In Russian, the word \\"но\\" serves the same function. - The sum: It refers to the collective total or accumulation of something; in this case, it is about the results achieved. The translation in Russian would be \\"сумма.\\" - Of the results achieved: This phrase describes the outcomes or consequences that have been attained through some effort or work. The appropriate translation in Russian would be \\"достигнутых результатов.\\" - Confirms: To assert or establish something as true or valid. The Russian translation would be \\"подтверждает.\\" - In principle: It means essentially or fundamentally. The equivalent expression in Russian would be \\"в принципе.\\" - The human being: It refers to any individual of the Homo sapiens species. The Russian translation is \\"человеческое существо.\\" - Can arrive at: It means to reach, achieve, or attain something. The verb phrase in Russian would be \\"может прийти к.\\" - The truth: It signifies an objective reality or fact. In Russian, the translation for truth would be \\"истине.\\" 3. Combining the translated words into a coherent Russian sentence structure: Forming a coherent and grammatically correct sentence from the translated words and phrases, we get: \\"Но сумма достигнутых результатов подтверждает, что в принципе человеческое существо может прийти к истине.\\" 4. Reviewing the translation: Going through the translation again to ensure proper grammar, vocabulary, and syntax usage, we confirm that the sentence is accurate, preserves the original meaning, and makes sense in the Russian language."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ugandans cast votes in presidential elections after lengthy delays Related: Ugandan elections: what you need to know After delays blamed on slow delivery of voting materials, Ugandans have begun casting their ballots in presidential elections. Five hours after voting was scheduled to start, some polling stations in the capital, Kampala,had still not received any voting papers. People had formed long lines and ballot boxes had arrived by mid-morning, but by noon there were still no ballots. President Yoweri Museveni faces a strong challenge from Kizza Besigye, who has called Museveni a dictator and said he doubted voting would be free or fair. Many people complained of an apparent shutdown of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Godfrey Mutabazi, head of the Uganda Communications Commission, said the network failure was probably caused by an ongoing operation to contain a security threat. “It’s a security matter and I cannot answer on behalf of security,” he said. Some observers suspected it was to keep people from publicly griping about the late delivery of voting materials. More than 15 million people are registered to vote for members of parliament and the presidency. Some ballot boxes had missing lids. “We are late simply because the lids for ballot boxes are not here. The boxes and the lids should have arrived at the same time,” said Moses Omo, an official presiding over voting at a Catholic church in the central Ugandan district of Wakiso. Many of those waiting said they would not leave without voting. “This is very disappointing, but I am going to stay here under the sun until it is my turn to vote,” said Fred Mubiru, a taxi driver. “Nothing will discourage me.” Although opinion polls had shown Museveni to be ahead of his opponents, analysts expect this election to be his toughest yet, citing the massive crowds Besigye attracted across the country. Museveni, 71, remains popular in some parts of rural Uganda, where he is seen as a father figure and is beloved by those who remember his time as a guerrilla leader fighting a dictatorship. He came to power in 1986 and pulled Uganda out of years of chaos. He is widely credited with restoring peace and presiding over economic growth, and is a key US ally on security matters, especially in Somalia. But his critics worry that he may want to rule for life, and accuse him of using the security forces to intimidate the opposition. Besigye, 59, is running for the fourth time against Museveni. He campaigned on a promise to run a more effective government, vowing to stem official corruption. He said he would continue “the struggle” in other ways if he lost the election, suggesting a protest movement similar to the one that followed the last election in 2011. That movement was violently put down by security forces. The New York-based Human Rights Watch said a weak “human rights situation seriously undermines the prospects of free and fair elections and the ability of Ugandans to exercise fundamental human rights such as free expression, assembly, and association”. The Committee to Protect Journalists has also reported “a worsening pattern of harassment and intimidation of journalists” in Uganda. There has been a heavy security presence in Kampala in the run-up to the polls, with armed police patrolling the streets and armoured vehicles stationed at key junctions. Summary:","output":"People in Uganda have started voting for a new president after there were some delays. The people who are voting have to choose who they want to be their leader. The current president, Yoweri Museveni, and another man named Kizza Besigye, are both trying to become the president. Some people had to wait a long time to vote because there weren't enough papers for everyone to use. Some people were also upset because they couldn't use websites like Twitter and Facebook while they were waiting. The person who wins will help make decisions for Uganda and its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates?  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Sentence: Bionico is a dessert that requires granola as one of its ingredients. Honey can also be added to it. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"Several pieces of data can be extracted from the given sentence, providing information about the dessert Bionico and its ingredients.  1. Name of the dessert: Bionico    It mentions that the focus is on a particular dessert known as Bionico. 2. Bionico is a dessert    The sentence establishes that Bionico belongs to the category of desserts. This means it is a sweet dish typically served at the end of a meal or as a snack. 3. Requirement of granola as an ingredient    The sentence states that granola is a required ingredient for making Bionico. Granola is a breakfast food and snack made from rolled oats, nuts, and a sweetener such as honey or sugar, often baked until crisp. This suggests that Bionico includes crunchy and possibly nutritious elements in its composition. 4. Honey as a potential added ingredient    The sentence mentions that honey can be added to Bionico, implying that it is an optional ingredient. Some Bionico recipes may include honey, while others may not. Honey is a natural sweetener and has various health benefits, so its addition to the dessert may serve both taste and health purposes. 5. Inclusion of multiple ingredients    Bionico is a dessert made with more than one ingredient. It is evident from the mentioned use of granola and optionally honey. The sentence suggests a diverse range of tastes and textures within the dessert. 6. Recipe modification    The information allows us to understand that Bionico's recipe can be altered depending on the cook's preferences. The addition of honey or the type of granola used can vary, contributing to the uniqueness of each Bionico dessert created. To summarize, from the given sentence, we can extract data on the dessert's name (Bionico), the fact it's a dessert, granola being a required ingredient, the potential addition of honey, the involvement of multiple ingredients, and the possibility of recipe modification."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...

Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace.

For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","output":"The British TV series that inspired \\"All in the Family\\" is \\"Till Death Us Do Part.\\"  \\"Till Death Us Do Part\\" was a prominent and widely watched program in the UK, which aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975. This sitcom was heralded for its raw and controversial approach to dealing with social and political issues of the time, just like its American counterpart later would. The British show was created by Johnny Speight and centered around the character Alf Garnett, an unabashed conservative played by Warren Mitchell. Alf frequently argued with his left-wing son-in-law, Mike, giving the series its central conflict. Much of the political and social commentary from the show came from these two characters’ back-and-forths, with Alf's wife Else and daughter Rita often caught in the middle. \\"All in the Family,\\" the American remake, similarly focuses on the life of Archie Bunker (a character analogous to Alf Garnett), a working-class bigot who constantly battles with his son-in-law, Mike “Meathead” Stivic over themes such as racism, feminism, and other topical issues. The show was broadcast on CBS from 1971 to 1979 and was created by producer Norman Lear. Just like its British predecessor, \\"All in the Family\\" was a groundbreaking show which didn't shy away from addressing pressing societal issues, using humor as a vehicle to present and grapple with these themes. The character of Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor, became a cultural icon, while the show itself effectively pioneered the genre of the socially-conscious sitcom in American television. It maintained high rankings in the Nielsen ratings, being the number one-rated show for five years, from 1971–1972 to 1975–1976. Despite being borne out of contentious and provocative subject matter, both shows were important for their respective cultures and have left a significant legacy on sitcoms that followed them. They broke away from the perception of sitcoms as purely escapist entertainment and demonstrated the genre’s ability to tackle societal issues head-on, opening the door for many similar shows that came after them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If I ate a can of sardines everyday and ran for an hour, would this make me lose weight fast? What would happen if I ate a can of sardines and jogged two miles everyday? Pick your answer from: - no; - yes; The answer is:","output":"no. Before dissecting these questions, it is important to understand the context behind them. Both queries revolve around daily activities involving sardine consumption and some form of physical exercise. However, there are differences in the specifics of each scenario posed.  The first question, \\"If I ate a can of sardines everyday and ran for an hour, would this make me lose weight fast?\\" addresses the possibility of rapid weight loss from the combination of eating a can of sardines every day and running for an hour daily. This involves a particular amount of time set for running – an hour, which might translate to different distances covered daily depending on the individual's speed.  The second question, \\"What would happen if I ate a can of sardines and jogged two miles everyday?\\", on the other hand, queries the potential outcome from consuming a can of sardines each day and jogging a defined distance – two miles. Here, the focus is on a specific distance rather than a set duration for jogging. So while both questions involve the same kind of diet (eating a can of sardines daily) and exercise, they differ in the parameters of the exercise: one defines the exercise by time (an hour) while the other does so by distance (two miles). These differences in the parameters can impact the total caloric burn, intensity of the exercise, and overall exertion on the body, thereby affecting the ultimate outcome in terms of weight loss, body composition, fitness levels, etc. Therefore, these questions cannot be considered identical.    Additionally, the first statement is specifically asking about the speed of weight loss as a consequence of these actions, while the second question is more general and open-ended about what could potentially happen, not exclusively pertaining to weight loss nor its speed.

Keep in mind, however, that custom longboards can be created with even larger dimensions, but they are not considered standard sizes in the industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation  for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype   that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete,  occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 - December 26, 2010), better known by her stage name Teena Marie, was an American singer-songwriter, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T), given to her by her collaborator and friend, Rick James. She was known for her distinctive soulful vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was African-American. Her success in R&B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. Context: Contacted by Epic Records in the fall of 1982, after expressing dismay over her Motown contract, Teena Marie signed a worldwide deal with the Columbia Records subsidiary that also allowed her to establish her own publishing company, Midnight Magnet. Epic released the concept album Robbery, which featured the hit \\"Fix It\\" (#21 R&B), as well as \\"Shadow Boxing\\" and \\"Casanova Brown.\\" (The latter was one of many tracks Teena Marie would write over the years about her real-life romance with one-time mentor Rick James. The relationship had ended by that point, but the two continued a sometimes tempestuous friendship until James' death, in August 2004.)  In 1984, Teena Marie released her biggest-selling album, Starchild. It yielded her biggest hit \\"Lovergirl\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1985 and at No. 9 on the R&B chart. The label also released the moderate R&B hit \\"Out on a Limb\\", which peaked at No. 56 on the R&B chart but didn't break the Hot 100. \\"14k\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film The Goonies (1985) but was not a hit (only making the U.S. R&B charts at #87).  In 1986, Teena Marie released a rock music-influenced concept album titled Emerald City. It was controversial with her established fan base and not as successful as its predecessors. She also recorded the rock-influenced track, \\"Lead Me On\\", co-produced by Giorgio Moroder, for the soundtrack of the box office hit film Top Gun (1986).  In 1988, she returned to R&B and funk, releasing the critically acclaimed album Naked to the World. That album contained the hit \\"Ooo La La La\\", which reached the top of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart and was her only No. 1 single on that chart. During her 1988 Naked to the World concert tour, she suffered a fall and was hospitalized for six months.  Teena Marie released Ivory in the fall of 1990; it scored no pop hits, but it did experience two R&B hits: \\"Here's Looking at You\\" (#11 R&B) and \\"If I Were a Bell\\" (#8 R&B). Question: Most famous person she worked with?. Whats the answer?","output":"The most famous person Teena Marie worked with was Rick James. Apart from being her collaborator and friend, Rick James was also her one-time mentor and helped establish her career. Their real-life romantic relationship inspired several songs throughout Teena Marie's career. Even after their relationship ended, they continued to maintain a sometimes tempestuous friendship until Rick James' death in August 2004."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Acipenser is a genus of sturgeons.

The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia. It contains two species, which both are critically endangered:  - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - Scaphirhynchinae is a subfamily of sturgeon which includes two genera comprising a total of six species .

Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. What is probably true about Rick Saccone?  A. He hoped more republicans had come out to vote for him  B. not enough information  C. He wanted a recount  D. He was not ready to concede the race A:","output":"D.

Dame Jane Morris Goodall  (; born Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, 3 April 1934), formerly Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall, is a British primatologist and anthropologist. Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his wife Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.  In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates. She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was \\"Tanganyika\\" at that time and a British protectorate.  Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University. She went to Newnham College, and obtained a PhD degree in ethology. She became the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD there without first having obtained a BA or BSc. Her thesis was completed in 1965 under the tutorship of Robert Hinde, titled Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees, detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.

Better still, you can go without armour completely for maximum speed.  Also keep in mind that armour tends to have a big weight associated with it. Not only will wearing a heavy armour slow you down, the weight attached will bog down your weight capacity considerably. On the other hand, some sets of armour like Power Armour come with a Strength bonus, which in turn will help boost your weight capacity. One of the most common speed-related complaints in Fallout 3 is the speed penalty you get from carrying too much equipment. If you're finding your speed bogged down, try dropping or selling some of your supplies. Before too long, you should find your character running at a better rate. Aim to discard junk items and extra sets of armour, as they tend to be the heaviest items in the game. Your character will be slowed down naturally if you have any weapons out. Try to make a habit of holstering your weapons whenever you're not using them. A hefty portion of the game's not going to require constant use of weapons, so while you might want that extra bit of caution, in most cases it's unnecessary.  You can holster your weapon by holding the Reload button. Keep in mind that two-handed weapons (e.g. rifles, flamethrowers) will slow you down more than one-handed weapons, like pistols. If you're still worried about downtime while you're drawing a weapon, you can get the Quick Draw perk, which will make the holster/draw process 50% faster.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Noriko's Dinner Table Movie plot: The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo. A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school. Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at \\"home\\" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name \\"Ueno Station 54\\". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life. Six months later, 54 girls jump in front of a train at Shinjuku station and committ suicide while Noriko and Kumiko look on. It is implied that the 54 were members of the...

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello little friend! I'll answer your questions one by one. Question 1: An IP address is a set of numbers that helps identify a device on the internet, kind of like a home address for your computer or phone. Some people might use this information to understand where that device is located, or to make sure it can connect to certain websites. But, it's important to remember we should always respect other people's privacy and not use their IP address in a not-so-nice way. Question 2: People eat insects for many reasons! In some cultures, they see it as a yummy snack, or even a special treat. Insects can also be a good source of protein, which helps us grow strong and healthy. Plus, eating insects might be better for our planet, since raising insects can be more environmentally friendly than other methods of producing food. To your last question, the answers to these two questions are not the same, as they talk about different things: one is about IP addresses in technology, and the other is about the reasons for eating insects.
