Substituting the value of r, we get: [V = frac{4}{3}pi left(frac{sqrt{6}}{2}right)^3 = frac{4}{3}pi times frac{6sqrt{6}}{8} = frac{4}{3}pi times frac{3sqrt{6}}{4} = sqrt{6}pi.] Therefore, the volume of sphere O is boxed{sqrt{6}pi}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"instruction":"The set ( M = {1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 10, 20, 30, 99, 100} ) has 10 elements.

To find this minimum, we look for critical points by setting the derivative to zero: 3x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0. The above equation can be rewritten as 3(x-2)^2 - 13 = 0. This implies that the minimum slope occurs when (x-2)^2 is minimized, which happens at x = 2. Substituting x = 2 into the derivative, we get the minimum slope: y'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 12(2) - 1 = 12 - 24 - 1 = -13. We now know that the slope of the tangent line at the point where x = 2 is -13. To find the equation of this tangent line, we need a point on the curve when x = 2. Plugging x = 2 into the original function, we obtain the corresponding y-coordinate: y(2) = (2)^3 - 6(2)^2 - 2 + 6 = 8 - 24 - 2 + 6 = -12.

Among any four consecutive terms, there must be at least two consecutive rational numbers because only one irrational number cannot make up more than one pair of terms.     - Let the two consecutive rational numbers be (a_i) and (a_{i+1}). This implies:       [       a_{i+1} = a_i cdot q       ]     - Since both (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) are rational, (q) (the ratio of two rational numbers) must also be rational.     - If (q) is rational and (a_{1}) is rational, all terms in the sequence must be rational, which contradicts the presence of irrational numbers in the sequence. 4. **Conclusion by Contradiction**:     - If we assume there are more than three rational numbers, an irrational number cannot be included in the sequence without disrupting the rational sequence property.     - Thus, at most, there can be three rational numbers in this geometric progression. Therefore, the maximum number of rational terms in the given geometric progression is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"instruction":"Three machines text{P, Q, and R,} working together, can complete a job in x hours.

The total amount of pears sold in the day is the sum of the morning and afternoon sales, which is x + 2x = 3x. We are told that the total kilograms of pears sold that day is 420 kg.

As a result, we also have that AM parallel LP and that triangle AMB is similar to triangle LPB due to the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, which states that two triangles are similar if they have two corresponding angles equal. From the similarity of triangle AMB and triangle LPB, we can write the ratio of corresponding sides as follows: [ frac{AM}{LP} = frac{AB}{LB} ] Since AB = AL + LB, we can substitute AB with AL + LB in the ratio: [ frac{AM}{LP} = frac{AL + LB}{LB} ] This can be simplified to: [ frac{AM}{LP} = frac{AL}{LB} + 1 ] To find the ratio frac{AL}{LB}, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem on triangle ABC, with overline{CL} bisecting angle ACB. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created on one side of the triangle by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.

Consider the given square (ABCD). 2. Draw semicircles on each side of the square (ABCD) such that these sides act as diameters. The semicircles intersect at points:    - (E) and (F) on side (AB),    - (G) and (H) on side (CD),    - where the chords (AE), (BF), (CG), and (DH) equal the given side of the small square. 3. Because semi-circles are symmetric about the diameter, these chords are straight lines. Therefore, we have four right triangles:    - (ADE),    - (BAF),    - (BCG),    - and (DCH). 4. Specifically, consider ( angle ADE ):    - Since (ADE) is a right triangle, ( angle ADE = 90^circ ).    - Similarly, since ( angle BAF = 90^circ ), lines (AE) and (BF) make ( angle BAF = angle BAE). 5.

Furthermore, the four triangles mentioned above are right triangles formed between the edges of the original square and lines drawn to (E, F, G, H). 7. Validate your construction:    - The square (EFGH) trivially fits within the original square (ABCD), using the semicircle and chord construction.    - Each side of (EFGH) is parallel to the sides of (ABCD), given the perpendicular drop from semicircles ensures all right angles needed. # Conclusion: The original square (ABCD) is thus divided into: - A smaller square (EFGH), and - Four congruent right triangles (ADE), (BAF), (BCG), and (DCH), ensuring the division criteria are met.

This directly matches the derived condition but considering the context of necessary but not sufficient conditions, it's too restrictive. **Conclusion**: Given the analysis above, the most appropriate choice is **Option A**, {-2leqslant aleqslant 2}, as it encompasses the necessary condition for the proposition to be false without being overly restrictive.

Since there's an external angle equal to the smallest angle (3x) attached at the largest angle, the sum of the external and internal angles at that point would be (9x + 3x = 12x). For a triangle, normally the internal angles sum to (180^circ). Considering the geometry of the problem, the sum of only the internal angles (i.e., (3x + 4x + 9x = 16x)) still needs to equate to (180^circ) because the attachment of the external angle doesn't change the sum of the internal angles.

Given that the ellipse (C) has its center at the origin, foci on the (x)-axis, and an eccentricity (e = frac{1}{2}), we use the definition of eccentricity for ellipses:    [    e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} = frac{1}{2}    ]    Squaring both sides, we obtain:    [    left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}     frac{1}{4} = 1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}     frac{b^2}{a^2} = 1 - frac{1}{4}     frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{3}{4}    ] 2. The given ellipse passes through the point ( M(1, frac{3}{2}) ). Therefore, substitute (x = 1) and (y = frac{3}{2}) into the standard ellipse equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1):    [    frac{1^2}{a^2} + frac{left( frac{3}{2} right)^2}{b^2} = 1     frac{1}{a^2} + frac{frac{9}{4}}{b^2} = 1    ]    Using (frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{3}{4}), we replace (frac{1}{b^2}) with (frac{4}{3a^2}):    [    frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{4} cdot frac{4}{3a^2} = 1     frac{1}{a^2} + frac{9}{3a^2} = 1     frac{10}{3a^2} = 1     a^2 = frac{10}{3} cdot frac{3}{10}     a^2 = 4    ]    Therefore:    [    b^2 = frac{3}{4} a^2 = 3    ] 3.

If the pain subsided after 3 days and he knew that the injury would take at least 5 times that long to fully heal, we multiply 3 days by 5: 3 days * 5 = 15 days for full healing. After the injury is fully healed, James wants to wait another 3 days before he starts working out again: 15 days (healing) + 3 days (waiting) = 18 days before he starts working out. Now, James wants to wait 3 weeks before he starts lifting heavy again. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 3 weeks by 7 days: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

If Bernardo picks a 10, then any three-digit number he forms will always be larger than any three-digit number Silvia can form, whose largest possible digit is 9.

We need to show that there exists a positive integer N such that for any positive integer n > N, a_n < b_n holds.  1. **Expression for a_n:** [ a_{n+1} = frac{a_n + 1}{2} ] Subtract 1 from both sides: [ a_{n+1} - 1 = frac{a_n + 1}{2} - 1 = frac{a_n - 1}{2} ] It follows that: [ a_{n+1} - 1 = frac{1}{2} (a_n - 1) ] By iterating this relationship, we see: [ a_n - 1 = left( frac{1}{2} right)^n (a_0 - 1) ] Adding 1 to both sides, we get: [ a_n = 1 + left( frac{1}{2} right)^n (a_0 - 1) ] 2. **Expression for b_n:** [ b_{n+1} = b_n^k Rightarrow b_n = b_0^{k^n} ] 3. **Asymptotic Behavior:** Since a_0, b_0 in (0,1), hence [ a_0 - 1, b_0 - 1 in (-1, 0) ] By applying Bernoulli's inequality: [ b_n = b_0^{k^n} = left(1 + (b_0 - 1)right)^{k^n} geq 1 + k^n (b_0 - 1) ] 4. **Finding N:** We need to find N such that for any n > N, we have a_n < b_n.

Given the polynomial (p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d) with integer coefficients (a, b, c, d), and knowing that (p(1) = 2015) and (p(2) = 2017), we need to prove that the equation (p(x) = 2016) has no integer solutions. 2. First, observe the parity of the values of (p(x)) at specific integers:     - (p(1) = a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 + c(1) + d = a + b + c + d = 2015)     - (p(2) = a(2)^3 + b(2)^2 + c(2) + d = 8a + 4b + 2c + d = 2017) 3. Since both (p(1)) and (p(2)) are known:     - (p(1) = 2015) (odd number)     - (p(2) = 2017) (odd number) 4. Notice that the parity of (p(x)) depends on whether (x) is odd or even:     - For any odd (x), if we express (x) as (2k + 1):       [       p(2k + 1) = a(2k + 1)^3 + b(2k + 1)^2 + c(2k + 1) + d       ]       This simplifies to:       [       p(2k + 1) = a(8k^3 + 12k^2 + 6k + 1) + b(4k^2 + 4k + 1) + c(2k + 1) + d       ]       Summarizing the parity:       - Terms involving (k) are products of integers, hence even.       - The constant terms in the polynomial (coefficients (a, b, c, d)) sum with the constants raised to an odd power, thus the entire expression will be odd due to odd coefficients in constants. 5. For any even (x), if we express (x) as (2k):     - Evaluating at (x = 2k) similarly results in an odd number for (p(2)). 6. This observation about the parity (odd/even nature):    - (p(x)) being evaluated at all integers (x) (whether even or odd) results in odd values. 7. Hence, (p(x)) minus any even number (like 2016) always results in an odd number:     [     p(x) - 2016 = (text{odd}) - (text{even}) = text{odd}     ] 8. Implication:    - Since (p(x) - 2016) is odd for any integer (x), it can never be zero (as zero is even). 9.

The discount in December is 16% of the original price. So, we calculate the discount amount: Discount amount = 16% of 470 Discount amount = 0.16 * 470 Discount amount = 75.20 Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price in December: Discounted price in December = Original price - Discount amount Discounted price in December = 470 - 75.20 Discounted price in December = 394.80 Next, we calculate the increased price 6 months later after the holiday season when the company raised the price by 12%. Increase amount = 12% of the discounted price in December Increase amount = 0.12 * 394.80 Increase amount = 47.376 Now, we add the increase amount to the discounted price to get the new price after the holiday season: New price after holiday season = Discounted price in December + Increase amount New price after holiday season = 394.80 + 47.376 New price after holiday season = 442.176 Since prices are typically rounded to the nearest cent, the new price after the holiday season would be approximately 442.18.

Let's consider a convex polygon A_{1}A_{2} ldots A_{n} and a point X inside or on the boundary of this polygon. Our goal is to prove that the point maximizing the sum of distances to the vertices of the polygon must be one of its vertices.     2. Define the function f(X) = sum_{i=1}^n d(A_i, X), where d(A_i, X) is the distance from the vertex A_i to the point X. We need to show that f(X) is maximized at a vertex. 3. Consider any segment PQ inside or on the boundary of the polygon, and a point X dividing PQ in the ratio lambda : (1 - lambda), where 0 leq lambda leq 1. According to the section formula from vector algebra, we have:        overrightarrow{A_i X} = (1 - lambda) overrightarrow{A_i P} + lambda overrightarrow{A_i Q}        Consequently, by the triangle inequality, the distance A_i X is also bounded by:        d(A_i, X) leq (1 - lambda) d(A_i, P) + lambda d(A_i, Q)     4. Summing up the distances from X to all vertices A_i, we obtain:        f(X) = sum_{i=1}^n d(A_i, X) leq sum_{i=1}^n [(1 - lambda) d(A_i, P) + lambda d(A_i, Q)]        This can be written as:        f(X) leq (1 - lambda) sum_{i=1}^n d(A_i, P) + lambda sum_{i=1}^n d(A_i, Q) = (1 - lambda) f(P) + lambda f(Q)     5. The above inequality shows that f(X) is a convex function on the segment PQ. Therefore, the maximum value of f(X) on PQ must occur at one of the endpoints, either P or Q. Therefore, inside the segment PQ, there cannot be a point where f(X) takes a strictly greater value than at the endpoints. 6. Now, consider any point X inside or on the boundary of the polygon. We can always find a segment PQ with P and Q either being vertices of the polygon or one vertex and one point on a side, such that X lies on this segment. Then:        f(X) leq max(f(P), f(Q))     7. By iterating this argument along multiple segments connecting X to the closest vertices, we eventually establish that the maximum value of f(X) within the polygon is attained at one of the vertices. In conclusion, the point within or on the boundary of the polygon that maximizes the sum of the distances to the vertices of the polygon is indeed one of the vertices. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Determine how many integer palindromes are between 200 and 700.","output":"1.

Combining terms in the numerator gives us  frac{-x-3}{x+1} geq 0.  The solution to this inequality is the interval -3 leq x < -1. Therefore, the set B can be represented as the interval B = [-3, -1). The intersection A cap B is the set of elements that are common to both A and B, which corresponds to the interval [-2, -1) because it is the only segment where both set conditions are satisfied. The union A cup B is the set of all elements that are in A or B or both, which is the interval [-3, +infty) since it includes all the values from both A and B. Thus, we have:  A cap B = boxed{[-2, -1)} text{ and } A cup B = boxed{[-3, +infty)}.  (2) The complement of A in the universal set U, notated as complement_U A, refers to all the elements in U that are not in A. Since A = [-2, +infty), the complement is complement_U A = (-infty, -2). To find (complement_U A) cap B, we look for the intersection of (-infty, -2) and [-3, -1), which is simply the interval [-3, -2), because -2 is not included in set B.

Since ( AGCP ) is a parallelogram, its diagonals ( GP ) and ( CA ) bisect each other. This implies that the midpoint of ( GP ) is the midpoint of ( CA ), which is point ( E ).

How many days did Dakota spend in the hospital?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the specialists. Since each specialist looks at Dakota for 15 minutes, that's a quarter of an hour for each. So, for two specialists, the cost would be: 250/hour * 0.25 hours/specialist * 2 specialists = 125/specialist * 2 = 250 Now, let's subtract the cost of the ambulance ride and the specialists from the total bill to find out the cost for the hospital bed: 4625 (total bill) - 1800 (ambulance) - 250 (specialists) = 2575 Now we have the cost for the hospital bed alone. Since the hospital charges 900 per day for the bed, we can find out how many days Dakota spent in the hospital by dividing the cost for the bed by the daily charge: 2575 (bed cost) / 900/day = 2.8611 days Since Dakota can't spend a fraction of a day in the hospital, we'll round up to the nearest whole day.

Since Greg has six hours less than Jacob, and Jacob has 18 hours, we subtract 6 from 18 to find Greg's time: Greg's time = Jacob's time - 6 hours Greg's time = 18 hours - 6 hours Greg's time = 12 hours Next, let's find out how much time Patrick has left. Patrick has 4 hours less than twice the amount of time that Greg has, so we first multiply Greg's time by 2 and then subtract 4: Patrick's time = 2 * Greg's time - 4 hours Patrick's time = 2 * 12 hours - 4 hours Patrick's time = 24 hours - 4 hours Patrick's time = 20 hours Now, let's find out how much time Samantha has left.

Let us denote this sum by ( S_n ): 1. **Step 1: Examining the sum ( S_n )**    Consider the expression:        frac{a_{1}^{2}}{a_{1}+a_{2}} + frac{a_{2}^{2}}{a_{2}+a_{3}} + ldots + frac{a_{n-1}^{2}}{a_{n-1}+a_{n}} + frac{a_{n}^{2}}{a_{n}+a_{1}}.

The entire left-hand side, when compared cyclically and summed, forms a telescoping series:        (a_{1} - a_{2}) + (a_{2} - a_{3}) + ldots + (a_{n-1} - a_{n}) + (a_{n} - a_{1}) = 0.        Therefore, the cyclic shift does not change ( S_n ). 3. **Step 3: Doubling the inequality**    Now, rewrite the inequality to incorporate the summation twice:        2 S_n geq a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{n}.     4. **Step 4: Simplifying the double sum**    Then, double the terms on the right-hand side as follows:        frac{a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2}}{a_{1} + a_{2}} + frac{a_{2}^{2} + a_{3}^{2}}{a_{2} + a_{3}} + ldots + frac{a_{n}^{2} + a_{1}^{2}}{a_{n} + a_{1}} geq frac{a_{1} + a_{2}}{2} + frac{a_{2} + a_{3}}{2} + ldots + frac{a_{n} + a_{1}}{2}.     5. **Step 5: Applying the AM-GM inequality**    For positive numbers ( x ) and ( y ), using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality, we have:        frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{2} geq left( frac{x + y}{2} right)^{2}.        Simplifying further,        frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{x + y} geq frac{x + y}{2}.     6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, each term individually satisfies the inequality, which in turn implies the sum of all such terms satisfies:        frac{a_{1}^{2}}{a_{1} + a_{2}} + frac{a_{2}^{2}}{a_{2} + a_{3}} + ldots + frac{a_{n-1}^{2}}{a_{n-1} + a_{n}} + frac{a_{n}^{2}}{a_{n} + a_{1}} geq frac{1}{2} left( a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{n} right).

Since line l intersects the ellipse C at two distinct points, we require the discriminant to be greater than zero, i.e., (6m)^2 + 36(3m^2 + 4) > 0, which holds for all m in mathbb{R}. The area of triangle MNR is S_{triangle MNR} = frac{1}{2} |PR| cdot |y_1 - y_2|, which simplifies to sqrt{(y_1 + y_2)^2 - 4y_1y_2} = frac{12sqrt{m^2 + 1}}{3m^2 + 4}. Let t = sqrt{m^2 + 1} (thus t geq 1), so we can rewrite S_{triangle MNR} = frac{12t}{3t^2 + 1} = frac{12}{3t + frac{1}{t}}. Define f(t) = 3t + frac{1}{t}; this function is monotonically increasing on the interval [sqrt{3}/3, +∞). Thus for t geq 1, f(t) is monotonically increasing on [1, +∞), implying that f(t) geq f(1) = 4, Therefore, S_{triangle MNR} leq 3,  Hence, the maximum area of triangle MNR is boxed{3}, and at this time, the equation of the line l is boxed{x = 1}."},{"instruction":"(ab^2)^3= ?","output":"(-ab^2)^3 = (-a)^3(b^2)^3 = -a^3b^6.

Notice that segment ( MN parallel AD ). 2. **Determine Midpoints and Similar Triangles:**        Since ( A, B ), and ( F ) are points of tangency,    - ( A ) and ( B ) are equidistant from their respective points of tangency.    - ( K ) and ( F ) are midpoints.     - We have that ( AM = AK ), ( BM = BF ),     - Crucially, ( Q ) is the midpoint of ( MN ).

Our goal is to find the maximum value of z.

Since ( G ) is finite, it has a finite number of generators. 2. **Analyze the subgroups generated by individual elements:**    Consider the subgroups ( langle a_i rangle ) and ( langle a_j rangle ) for ( i neq j ). According to the problem, either ( langle a_i rangle cong langle a_j rangle ) or ( langle a_i rangle subseteq langle a_j rangle ) or ( langle a_j rangle subseteq langle a_i rangle ). 3. **Conclude that orders of generators are equal:**    If ( langle a_i rangle cong langle a_j rangle ), then the orders of ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) must be the same, i.e., ( |a_i| = |a_j| ).

By the given condition, either ( langle a_3 rangle subseteq langle a_1, a_2 rangle ) or ( langle a_1, a_2 rangle subseteq langle a_3 rangle ). Since ( langle a_3 rangle ) is generated by a single element, it cannot contain ( langle a_1, a_2 rangle ) unless ( langle a_1, a_2 rangle = langle a_3 rangle ). This implies ( n leq 2 ). 5. **Case ( n = 1 ):**    If ( n = 1 ), then ( G ) is cyclic and generated by a single element, which trivially satisfies the condition. 6. **Case ( n = 2 ):**    If ( n = 2 ), let ( G = langle a, b rangle ) with ( |a| = |b| = p^alpha ) for some prime ( p ) and integer ( alpha ). If ( alpha > 1 ), consider ( langle a rangle ) and ( langle b^p rangle ). Since ( langle b^p rangle ) is a proper subgroup of ( langle b rangle ), it must be that ( alpha = 1 ). Thus, ( |a| = |b| = p ). 7. **All elements have order ( p ):**    For any ( g in G ), considering ( langle g rangle ) and ( langle a rangle ), we must have ( |g| = p ). Therefore, ( G ) is an elementary abelian ( p )-group. 8. **Subgroups of ( G ):**    Any subgroup ( H ) of ( G ) must be generated by elements of order ( p ). If ( |H| = p ), it is cyclic and generated by one element. If ( |H| > p ), then ( H ) must be generated by at most two elements since ( G ) itself is generated by two elements.

According to the problem, the width is twice the length and twice the height, so we have: ( w = 2l ) and ( w = 2h ). Since the width of the foil-covered prism is 10 inches, and the cubes not touching any tin foil are surrounded by the foil-covered cubes, we need to subtract 2 from the width of the foil-covered prism to get the width of the figure created by the cubes not touching any tin foil (one layer of cubes on each side). Therefore, the width of the figure created by the cubes not touching any tin foil is: ( w = 10 - 2 times 1 = 8 ) inches. Now, using the relationships ( w = 2l ) and ( w = 2h ), we can find the length and height: ( l = w / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 ) inches, ( h = w / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4 ) inches.

And the property for square roots:        lg(sqrt{xy}) = frac{1}{2}lg(xy) = frac{1}{2}(lg x + lg y).     9. Substituting these back into the equation, we get:        lg(x + 2y) = 2lg(2) + frac{1}{2}(lg x + lg y).     10. Rearrange to isolate the term with  lg(x + 2y) :        lg(x + 2y) - 2 lg(2) = frac{1}{2} (lg x + lg y).     11.

We will approach this by considering subsets based on their smallest element. 1. **Case when the smallest element is 1:**    - If 1 in S, then 1 cdot 1 = 1 would violate the product-free condition. Therefore, no subset containing 1 can be product-free. 2. **Case when the smallest element is 2:**    - If 2 in S, then any multiple of 2 (i.e., 4, 6, 8, 10) cannot be in S because it would create a product pair (2, 2) = 4, (2, 3) = 6, etc.    - We consider the remaining elements {3, 5, 7, 9}:      - {3, 6, 9}: We can choose {3}, {6}, {9}, {6, 9}, or the empty set.

The equation log_{10}(a) + log_{10}(b) = log_{10}(a+b) presupposes that a and b are positive numbers since the logarithm is undefined for non-positive numbers. However, the addition inside a logarithm and multiplication of arguments outside the logarithm do not generally equate unless a and b are specific values that make the equation hold true.

Using the given condition repeatedly, we can conclude that f(6) = f(-2) = -f(2) = -(-f(-2)) = -(-f(6)). Thus, f(6) = -f(6). The only number that is equal to its own negative is 0, so f(6) = 0.

In other words, we assume that the center of the circular checker does not lie on a boundary between two squares or at the junction of four squares. 2. **Checker's Interaction with Board Boundaries:**    Since the checker is covering equal areas of red and black squares, some boundaries between adjacent squares must lie within the checker. If no boundary were inside the checker, the checker would be completely within a single square, covering only one color, contradicting the given condition of covering equal areas of red and black. 3. **Checker's Dimensions Relative to Square:**    The checker’s diameter is smaller than the side of any single square on the board. Consequently, there can be at most two boundaries within the checker — one vertical and one horizontal. 4. **Choosing a Relevant Boundary:**    Let ell represent one of the boundaries within the checker. We can assume ell to be parallel to the neighboring side of a square. 5. **Drawing a Diameter Parallel to Boundary:**    Consider a diameter (d) of the checker that is parallel to the boundary ell. The region of the checker strip delimited by the boundary ell and half of the diameter (d) should cover parts of one red and one black square. 6. **Analyzing the Areas Covered:**    Because the checker covers equal red and black areas, if the center were anywhere other than on a boundary, this strip’s red and black areas would not be symmetrical. 7. **Color Swap Hypothesis:**    Suppose we swap the colors within this strip. By this swap, if areas had been unequal before (due to an off-center placement), the swap would violate the condition of equal red and black areas, exposing that the original assumption is incorrect. 8. **Symmetry Argument:**    By this asymmetry, if the strip within the checker was perfectly symmetrical in colors concerning its center, this would only be possible if the center was precisely on the boundary between two squares or at the junction of four squares. 9. **Conclusion:**    Thus, our assumption that the center does not lie on a boundary must be false.

Since the leading coefficient is positive, it opens upwards, and thus the value of the quadratic is negative for x between 1 and 3. Thus if xle 1 or xge 3, we have |x^2-4x+3|=x^2-4x+3. We can solve the system in this range by setting the y-values equal, so begin{align*} x^2-4x+3&=frac{21}{4}-x x^2-3x+frac{12}{4}-frac{21}{4}&=0 x^2-3x-frac{9}{4}&=0. end{align*} By the quadratic formula, we find: x=frac{-(-3)pmsqrt{(-3)^2-4(frac{-9}{4})(1)}}{2(1)}=frac{3pmsqrt{9+9}}{2}=frac{3pmsqrt{18}}{2}=frac{3pm3sqrt{2}}{2}. A quick check shows that both solutions have either x<1 or x>3, so they are both valid in this system. We do not need to find the corresponding y-values since the problem asks only for the sum of the x-coordinates. If 1le xle 3, we know |x^2-4x+3|=-x^2+4x-3.

Thus, the total games within the first division = (4 times 3 = 12) games per team. With 5 teams, the total intra-division games in the first division frac{12 times 5}{2} = 30 (division by 2 is to avoid double-counting). - In the second division of 6 teams, each team plays the other 5 teams in its division 3 times. Thus, the total games within the second division = (5 times 3 = 15) games per team. With 6 teams, total intra-division games in the second division frac{15 times 6}{2} = 45. - Each team in the first division plays each team in the second division twice. Hence, the inter-division games = (5 times 6 times 2 = 60). Add the intra-divisions games and the inter-division games to get the total games in the season: - Total games = First division games + Second division games + Inter-division games = 30 + 45 + 60 = 135.

To find the intervals of increase and decrease, we first find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3a. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives the critical points: 3x^2 - 3a = 0 Rightarrow x^2 = a Rightarrow x = pm sqrt{a}. Since a > 0, both sqrt{a} and -sqrt{a} are real numbers, and f'(x) changes sign around these points, indicating they are points of local maxima and minima. Without loss of generality, assume -sqrt{a} corresponds to the maximum value and sqrt{a} corresponds to the minimum value. Given that the maximum value is 6 and the minimum value is 2, we have: f(-sqrt{a}) = 6, quad f(sqrt{a}) = 2. The function f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval where its derivative f'(x) is negative. From the derivative f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3a, it is clear that f'(x) < 0 when - sqrt{a} < x < sqrt{a}. Therefore, the interval where f(x) is monotonically decreasing is (-sqrt{a}, sqrt{a}).

Determine: a) The probability that exactly (k) gnomes will fall. b) The expected number of fallen gnomes.","output":"Let's solve the given problem in a detailed step-by-step manner.  Part (a) Probability that exactly ( k ) gnomes fall: 1. Let ( q = 1 - p ) be the probability that a gnome does not fall due to fright. 2. Consider the scenario where exactly ( k ) gnomes fall. To achieve this:    - The ( k )-th gnome (counting from the top) must fall.    - The ( n - k ) gnomes above must not fall. 3. Therefore, the probability is calculated by considering the above conditions:    - The probability that the first ( n - k ) gnomes do not fall is ( q^{n-k} ).    - The probability that the ( k )-th gnome falls due to fright is ( p ).    - So, the probability that exactly ( k ) gnomes fall is:      [      P(text{exactly } k text{ gnomes fall}) = q^{n-k} cdot p = p cdot (1 - p)^{n-k}      ]  Part (b) Expected number of gnomes that fall: 1.

The probability that the ( j )-th gnome does not fall is the probability that neither it falls nor any of the ( j-1 ) gnomes above it fall:    [    P(I_j = 0) = q^j    ] 4. Therefore, the expected value of ( I_j ) is:    [    E[I_j] = P(I_j = 1) = 1 - q^j    ] 5. The total number of fallen gnomes can be found by summing all indicator variables:    [    Eleft[sum_{j=1}^n I_jright] = sum_{j=1}^n E[I_j] = sum_{j=1}^n (1 - q^j)    ] 6.

This angle corresponds to triangle ( O_1OO_2 ). 5. **Triangle Consideration:**    In triangle ( O_1OO_2 ), because the angle ( angle O_1OO_2 leq 60^circ ), it implies that the side opposite this angle, which is ( O_1O_2 ), is not the longest side in the triangle ( O_1OO_2 ). 6. **Distance and Circle Containment:**    Since ( O ) lies within the circle centered at ( O_1 ) and radius ( r_1 ):    [    OO_1 < r_1    ]    Similarly, since ( O ) also lies within the circle centered at ( O_2 ):    [    OO_2 < r_2    ] 7. **Conclusion with Containment:**    Since ( OO_1 + OO_2 leq 2r ), where ( r ) is the smaller radius, the triangle inequality and our angle observation ensures that one of these conditions must hold true.

Given that ABCDEF is a hexagon inscribed in a circle and angle ACE = 90^circ, we can infer that AE is a diameter of the circle. This is because an inscribed angle that subtends a semicircle (or diameter) is a right angle. 2. Since AE is a diameter, the points A, C, and E divide the circle into two semicircles. Therefore, overarc{AC} + overarc{CE} = 180^circ. 3. We need to find the average of the measures of angle ABC and angle CDE. To do this, we will use the properties of the inscribed angles and arcs. 4. Note that angle ABC and angle CDE are inscribed angles that subtend arcs overarc{AC} and overarc{CE} respectively. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. 5. Let overarc{AC} = x and overarc{CE} = y. Since AE is a diameter, we have:    [    x + y = 180^circ    ] 6.

First Solution: 1. Consider any valid arrangement and identify the largest element, n. 2. Wherever n is in the sequence, it must be preceded by (n-1) since n's neighbors are (n-1) and any other smaller number in its place must still find this precedence valid.    If n is the last number in the sequence, it will be preceded directly by (n-1), who in turn will be preceded by (n-2), continuing backwards up to the point where we reach the smallest element left to be placed first.    This forces a sequence like ( k, k+1, ldots, n-1, n ). 3. For the smallest element, 1, it must be preceded by 2, and this continues up to the first element in line being the one decided to be first, leading to a strict sequence ( k-1, k-2, ldots, 2, 1 ).        Upon fixing the element k in the first place, there are ( binom{n-1}{k-1} ) ways to arrange the sequence from k-1, k-2, ldots, 2, 1 in this strict order while other greater elements ( k+1, k+2, ldots, n ). 4. The number arrangement sums to:   sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n-1}{k-1} = 2^{n-1}  since ( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{k} = 2^{n-1} ).  Second Solution: 1. We first prove that in any valid arrangement, the last position must be occupied by either 1 or n.    If the sequence's last element is any i strictly between 1 and n, it would necessity the conditions violating by having adjacent elements (i-1) or (i+1) ahead of both i. 2. Inductive Construction:     - The combination either places 1 or n in the last position.     - Each of the remaining n-1 elements must arrange in a sequence valid per earlier constraints.     Resulting in recurrence form: f(n) = 2f(n-1)  starting from base case ( f(1) = 1 ). 3. This results in: f(n) = 2^{n-1}   Third Solution: 1. Given a position ( k ) placed first,     each subsequent element must be either one less or one higher sequentially, formulated in binary assignments of movements to adjacent positions 0 or 1. 2.

First, express ( overrightarrow{B_1A} ) and ( overrightarrow{BC_1} ) using vectors:     [     overrightarrow{B_1A} = overrightarrow{B_1B} + overrightarrow{BA}     ]     and     [     overrightarrow{BC_1} = overrightarrow{BB_1} + overrightarrow{B_1C_1}     ] 5. Since (overrightarrow{B_1A}) and (overrightarrow{BC_1}) are perpendicular, their dot product must be zero:     [     left(overrightarrow{B_1B} + overrightarrow{BA}right) cdot left(overrightarrow{BB_1} + overrightarrow{B_1C_1}right) = 0     ] 6. Upon expanding the dot product, we get:     [     overrightarrow{B_1B} cdot overrightarrow{BB_1} + overrightarrow{B_1B} cdot overrightarrow{B_1C_1} + overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BB_1} + overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{B_1C_1} = 0     ] 7. Given the properties of the vectors in a right triangular prism:     - (overrightarrow{B_1B} cdot overrightarrow{BB_1} = -a^2) because the projection of (overrightarrow{B_1B}) on (overrightarrow{BB_1}) will be in the opposite direction.     - (overrightarrow{B_1B} cdot overrightarrow{B_1C_1} = 0) because (overrightarrow{B_1B}) and (overrightarrow{B_1C_1}) are perpendicular.     - (overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BB_1} = 0) because any vector in the base plane is perpendicular to a vertical edge.     - (overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{B_1C_1}) equals the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. Here (angle A = 60^circ) ). 8. Thus,    [    -a^2 + 0 + 0 + a * a cdot cos 60^circ = 0    ]    With:    [    cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2}    ] 9. Therefore, we have:    [    -a^2 + a^2 cdot frac{1}{2} = 0    ] 10. Solving for (a):    [    -a^2 + frac{a^2}{2} = 0    ]    [    -a^2 + frac{a^2}{2} = 0    ]    [    frac{-a^2 + a^2}{2} = 0    ]    [    frac{a^2}{2} = frac{a^2}{2}    ] 11.

By the definition of the sequence:    [    a_{N+1} = frac{b_N - 1}{2}    ]    Since (b_N) is a perfect square, let (b_N = k^2). Then:    [    a_{N+1} = frac{k^2 - 1}{2}    ]    We need to check that (a_{N+1}) is an integer.

When we talk about extending a line like AB, it implies that we are considering its infinite extension in both directions, which does not specify a particular segment or point.   - Therefore, **Option B is incorrect**. - **Option C: Extend the line segment AB**   - A line segment has two endpoints. Extending a line segment involves increasing its length from one of the endpoints, which can be done with precision to reach a specific length or endpoint.   - Therefore, **Option C is correct**. - **Option D: Construct the line AB=CD**   - Constructing a line with the condition AB=CD implies creating a line segment equal in length to another. However, the statement suggests constructing a line, which extends infinitely in both directions, not a segment. This does not align with the precision required for matching lengths of segments.   - Therefore, **Option D is incorrect**.

Show that, starting from any sequence A as above, fewer than n applications of the transformation t lead to a sequence B such that t(B) = B.","output":"We will prove the given statement by induction on n, the length of the sequence A. The statement claims that fewer than n applications of the transformation t lead to a sequence B such that t(B) = B.  Base Case: For n = 1, the sequence A can be either (0) or (0, 1). Applying t to these sequences: - t((0)) = (0), which is already stable since t(0) = 0. - t((0, 1)) = (0, 1), which is also stable since t(0) = 0 and t(1) = 1. Both sequences are stable after zero applications (i.e., they are initially stable), which is fewer than 1 application.  Inductive Step: Assume that the statement is true for all sequences of length up to n-1. We need to show it holds for a sequence of length n. Consider a sequence A = a_0, a_1, dots, a_n where 0 leq a_i leq i for each i. We apply the transformation t to A to get a new sequence t(A) = t(a_0), t(a_1), dots, t(a_n). By the definition of t, t(a_i) counts the number of terms preceding a_i in A that are different from a_i. Therefore, t(a_i) leq i because there are at most i terms before a_i. # Lemma 1: If t(a_i) = a_i for some i, then a_i is stable. **Proof of Lemma 1:** If t(a_i) = a_i, then the number of terms different from a_i before it remains the same upon subsequent applications of t. Thus, t^2(a_i) = t(a_i) = a_i, and so on. Hence, a_i is stable. # Lemma 2: If t(a_i) neq a_i, then t(a_i) > a_i. **Proof of Lemma 2:** Since t(a_i) counts the number of terms different from a_i before it, if t(a_i) neq a_i, it must be because there are more terms different from a_i than the value of a_i itself, implying t(a_i) > a_i. Now, applying t repeatedly to A, each term either becomes stable or increases until it becomes stable. Since each term a_i can increase at most up to i, and there are n+1 terms in A, it will take fewer than n applications of t for all terms to become stable. This is because each term can only increase a finite number of times (at most i times for each term a_i), and there are only n+1 terms. Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all n. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Mira has a cubical tank with each side measuring 8 feet.

Step 6: Cycle implications Consider a cycle, say ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k, A_1 ), in this graph: - Assume the edge between ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) corresponds to element ( x ). Therefore, exactly one of ( A_1 ) or ( A_2 ) contains ( x ). Now consider the cycle going from ( A_2 ) via ( A_3, ldots, A_k ) and back to ( A_1 ): - Since none of these edges are associated with ( x ), the state of containing ( x ) won't be altered along this path. Therefore, because of the cycle, the original assumption leads us to a contradiction: - Both ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) should either both include ( x ) or both exclude it, contradicting our assumption that ( exactly one ) of them contained ( x ). # Conclusion Hence, we conclude that there must exist at least one element ( x in X ) such that  [ A_1 setminus {x}, A_2 setminus {x}, ldots, A_n setminus {x} ]  are all different subsets.

Szekely*","output":"To prove that there is no distribution whose convolution square equals ( P ), we will proceed as follows: 1. **Define the Problem and Assumptions:**    - Let ( P ) be a probability distribution on the Borel sets of the real line.    - ( P ) is symmetric with respect to the origin.    - ( P ) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.    - The density function ( p ) of ( P ) is zero outside the interval ([-1, 1]) and within this interval, it is bounded between two positive numbers ( c ) and ( d ) (i.e., ( c < p(x) < d ) for ( x in [-1, 1] )). 2. **Convolution and Support:**    - Suppose there exist two independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) such that ( S = X_1 + X_2 ) has the density ( p ).    - Since ( S ) has support ([-1, 1]), ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) must have support ([-1/2, 1/2]). 3. **Symmetry and Density:**    - ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) are symmetric and have no atoms.    - Let ( mu ) be the measure such that ( mu([a, b]) = P(X_1 in [a, b]) = P(X_2 in [a, b]) ). 4. **Integral Inequality:**    - Consider the interval ([-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2} + epsilon]). If ( X_1 + X_2 in [-1, -1 + epsilon] ), then ( X_1, X_2 in [-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2} + epsilon] ).    - Therefore, we have:      [      muleft([-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2} + epsilon]right)^2 geq int_{[-1, -1 + epsilon]} p(x) , dx geq c epsilon      ] 5. **Density Behavior Near Boundaries:**    - Near the boundaries ( -1 ) and ( 1 ), the density of ( X_1 ) and ( X_2 ) would behave like ( frac{1}{sqrt{x + 1}} ) near ( -1^+ ) and ( frac{1}{sqrt{1 - x}} ) near ( 1^- ).    - This implies that the density ( mu * mu ) of ( X_1 + X_2 ) would diverge near ( 0 ), which contradicts the boundedness of ( p ) (since ( |p|_{infty} < d )). 6. **Contradiction via Summation:**    - Consider a fixed ( N ) and define:      [      a_k = muleft([-1 + frac{k-1}{N}, -1 + frac{k}{N}right) = sqrt{c}left(sqrt{frac{k}{N}} - sqrt{frac{k-1}{N}}right) + u_k      ]      where ( sum_{k=1}^n u_k geq 0 ) for all ( 1 leq n leq N ). 7. **Summation Inequality:**    - We have:      [      P(X_1 + X_2 in [-frac{1}{N}, frac{1}{N}]) geq sum_{k=1}^N muleft([-1 + frac{k-1}{N}, -1 + frac{k}{N}right) cdot muleft([1 - frac{k-1}{N}, 1 - frac{k}{N}right)      ]    - This implies:      [      frac{2d}{N} geq sum_{k=1}^N a_k^2      ]      which is false because:      [      sum_{k=1}^N a_k^2 = frac{c}{N} sum_{k=1}^N left(sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1}right)^2 + sum_{k=1}^N u_k^2 + 2sqrt{c} sum_{k=1}^N u_k left(sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1}right)      ]      and ( sum_{k=1}^N u_k left(sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1}right) geq 0 ). 8. **Final Contradiction:**    - Therefore:      [      frac{2d}{N} geq sum_{k=1}^N a_k^2 geq frac{c}{N} sum_{k=1}^N left(sqrt{k} - sqrt{k-1}right)^2 approx C frac{ln(N)}{N}      ]      which leads to a contradiction.

To create a delicious and healthy mixture that is 5.5% sugar, what should be the ratio of Cereal A to Cereal B to Cereal C, by weight?","output":"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the weights of the cereals and their respective sugar contents. Let's denote the weight of Cereal A as (a), the weight of Cereal B as (b), and the weight of Cereal C as (c). We want to find the ratio (a:b:c) such that the mixture has 5.5% sugar. The total weight of the mixture will be (a + b + c), and the total amount of sugar from each cereal will be (0.12a) from Cereal A, (0.03b) from Cereal B, and (0.07c) from Cereal C. The overall sugar content of the mixture should be 5.5%, so the total sugar in the mixture will be (0.055(a + b + c)). Setting up the equation based on the sugar content, we have: [0.12a + 0.03b + 0.07c = 0.055(a + b + c)] Expanding the right side of the equation, we get: [0.12a + 0.03b + 0.07c = 0.055a + 0.055b + 0.055c] Now, let's group the terms with the same variables: [(0.12a - 0.055a) + (0.03b - 0.055b) + (0.07c - 0.055c) = 0] Simplifying the equation, we get: [0.065a - 0.025b + 0.015c = 0] To find the ratio (a:b:c), we can express (a) and (c) in terms of (b). Let's set (b = 1) (as a reference weight) and solve for (a) and (c): [0.065a - 0.025(1) + 0.015c = 0] [0.065a + 0.015c = 0.025] Now, we can choose a value for (c) and solve for (a). Let's set (c = 1) as well: [0.065a + 0.015(1) = 0.025] [0.065a = 0.025 - 0.015] [0.065a = 0.010] [a = frac{0.010}{0.065}] [a = frac{1}{6.5}] [a = frac{2}{13}] So, for every 1 part of Cereal B and 1 part of Cereal C, we need (frac{2}{13}) parts of Cereal A to achieve a 5.5% sugar mixture. The ratio of Cereal A to Cereal B to Cereal C by weight is therefore (frac{2}{13}:1:1). To make it easier to use, we can multiply all parts of the ratio by 13 to get rid of the fraction: Cereal A: (2) Cereal B: (13) Cereal C: (13) So the final ratio by weight of Cereal A to Cereal B to Cereal C is boxed{(2:13:13)} ."},{"instruction":"An 10 by 4 rectangle has the same center as a circle of radius 5.

The origin (O) is at ((0,0)), and since (angle XOP = 30^{circ}) and (OP = 1), the coordinates of point (P) are (left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, frac{1}{2}right)). 3. Let the center of the circle (odot O_1) be (O_1(a, a)) as the circle symmetrically intersects both axes. Since the radius of this circle is the distance from (O_1) to (P), we have:     [     left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - aright)^2 + left(frac{1}{2} - aright)^2 = a^2     ] 4.

Let's construct a circle with radius R (the circumradius).  2. For any integer N, we can select N points A, B, and C on the circumference of the circle such that the sum of segments connecting these points is approximately the perimeter N l. Hence, we can find a configuration where:    [    N l < 2pi R.    ]    This shows that for large enough N, the perimeter l can be made smaller than R. Therefore (A) l > R + r is not necessarily true since we can find instances where l is made arbitrarily small. 3. Next, consider the possibility of (C) frac{1}{6} < R + r < 6l. For most practical triangles, the values R + r do not adhere to both inequalities simultaneously. Specifically:    [    frac{1}{6} < R + r    ]    and    [    R + r < 6l    ]    are not universally suitable constraints since R and r can significantly vary compared to l dependent on the shape and size of the triangle and its circumcircle/in-circle. Hence (C) is not generally correct. 4. Now, consider any triangle ABC. Construct the chords AB and BC such that AB > R and BC > R, then connect A to C to complete the triangle:     [     l = AB + BC + CA.     ]    Since initially, AB + BC > 2R > R + r, we note:    [    l > 2R.    ]    However, this does not strictly prove l > R + r or l leq R + r but merely provides a larger upper bound. Therefore any specific general equality regarding (B) is similarly not valid as definitive since counterexamples can exist dependent on AB, BC, and CA measurements in ratio to R and r. # Conclusion: Thus after examining and breaking down the options, none of the given relationships (A), (B), or (C) is universally correct for any arbitrary triangle ABC.

The total number of books when each student is supposed to receive 5 books, except the last person who receives fewer, must be at least enough for each of the x-1 students to receive 5 books, and leave at least 0 books for the last person. This gives us the inequality: [3x + 8 - 5(x - 1) geq 0] 2. However, it's also given that the last person will not receive 2 books, which means the total must be less than what would be needed for the last person to receive 2 books.

Assume ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. 2. Consider a specific type of cyclic quadrilateral, like an isosceles trapezoid (AD parallel BC). 3. Let AD = 2a, BC = 2b, and the legs (AB and CD) be equal, being c. The midpoints M and N of AD and BC respectively are connected, forming segment MN of length 2sqrt{ab}. 4. Assume point X on MN satisfies the perimeter condition. Let MX = x where x is the signed distance from M to X. 5. Calculate the perimeters of triangle ADX and triangle BCX:    [    p_{triangle ADX} = 2a + 2sqrt{a^2 + x^2}    ]    [    p_{triangle BCX} = 2b + 2sqrt{b^2 + (2sqrt{ab} - x)^2}    ] 6.

Consider specific values, for instance, a = 9 and b = 1:    [    8 + sqrt{81 + x^2} = 1 + sqrt{1 + (6 - x)^2}    ] 9. Squaring both sides:    [    (8 + sqrt{81 + x^2})^2 = (1 + sqrt{1 + (6 - x)^2})^2    ] 10. Simplify and equate:     [     64 + 81 + x^2 + 16sqrt{81 + x^2} = 1 + 36 - 12x + x^2     ] 11.

We need to show that there exists a combination of signs such that:    [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n} pm a_{n+1} = 0 ] 4. **Case 1: ( a_{n} = a_{n+1} ):**    - If ( a_{n} = a_{n+1} ), the sum involving ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1} ) and ( 2a_n ) is even, and by the induction hypothesis, there exists a combination of signs such that:      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n-1} pm (a_n - a_{n+1}) = 0 ]      Since ( a_n = a_{n+1} ), it simplifies to:      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n-1} = 0 ]    - Therefore, we have found the required combination of signs that result in zero. 5. **Case 2: ( a_{n} neq a_{n+1} ):**    - If ( a_{n} neq a_{n+1} ), introduce ( b = |a_{n} - a_{n+1}| ). The number ( b ) must satisfy:      - ( b ) has the same parity as ( a_n + a_{n+1} ) because the difference of two numbers with the same parity is even.      - Since ( 1 leq a_n leq n ) and ( 1 leq a_{n+1} leq n+1 ), ( 1 leq b leq n+1 ).    - By the induction hypothesis, there exists a combination of signs making the sum zero for the set ( {a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1}, b} ):      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n-1} pm b = 0 ]    - Since ( b = |a_{n} - a_{n+1}| ), either ( b = a_{n} - a_{n+1} ) or ( b = a_{n+1} - a_{n} ). We replace ( b ) and find:      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n-1} pm |a_{n} - a_{n+1}| = 0 ]      Which can be rewritten as:      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n-1} pm (a_{n} - a_{n+1}) = 0 ]    - Enumerating all cases of ( pm |a_{n} - a_{n+1}| ), we can cover:      [ a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n} pm a_{n+1} = 0 ] In both cases, there exists a combination of signs ( pm ) such that the weighted sum is zero. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that for any natural numbers (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n}) meeting the given conditions, one of the sums ( a_{1} pm a_{2} pm ldots pm a_{n} ) equals zero.

Vanya thought of a seven-digit number and subtracted the sum of all its digits except one. He got (9875352).

To find the greatest three-digit number fitting these criteria, we calculate how many times 45 fits into the largest three-digit number, 999, starting from 28:    - Subtract 28 from 1000 to focus on three-digit numbers: 1000 - 28 = 972.    - Divide 972 by 45 to find the maximum k: 972 div 45 = 21 remainder 27. 6. Therefore, the largest number is 45cdot 21 + 28 = 945 + 28 = 973. Hence, the greatest three-digit number that is one more than a multiple of 9 and three more than a multiple of 5 is boxed{973}."},{"instruction":"a class of 32 students, every day three students are chosen randomly to lead the morning assembly.

Our goal is to prove that for any non-complete graph G:    [    kappa(G) leq lambda(G) leq delta(G)    ] 2. **Edge Connectivity and Minimum Degree**:        To show lambda(G) leq delta(G), consider the following:    - Take a vertex v in G with degree delta(G). Removing all the edges incident to v will disconnect v from the rest of the graph.        Hence, the number of edges removed is exactly delta(G). Therefore:    [    lambda(G) leq delta(G)    ] 3. **Vertex Connectivity and Edge Connectivity**:        Next, we need to show kappa(G) leq lambda(G).     - Let F be a set of lambda(G) edges such that by removing these edges, the graph G - F becomes disconnected.    - By the definition of edge connectivity, such a set F always exists.    Now, consider any component of G - F:    - Since F is a smallest edge cut, it means that F separates the graph into at least two components. Selecting one of those components, let C be the component of G - F.    - Notice that F is a minimum edge cutset in G, meaning at most lambda(G) vertices in C are adjacent to vertices in other components of G - F. Therefore, these vertices across components are disconnected by at most lambda(G) vertex removals in case of G being disconnected. 4. **Special Case - Isolated Vertex Argument**:        Next, consider the following special case to reinforce kappa(G) leq lambda(G):    - Suppose G includes a vertex v that is not connected to any edge in F.    - If we let C be a subgraph of G - F that contains v, then there are at most lambda(G) vertices in C connected by edges in F to the rest of the graph.    - Because of the minimality of F, each edge in F connects a vertex in C with at most one vertex from other components.

Speed of the first train in m/s = 120 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 120 * 1000 / 3600 = 33.33 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 80 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 80 * 1000 / 3600 = 22.22 m/s Since the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = 33.33 m/s + 22.22 m/s = 55.55 m/s The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. The distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L meters.

Is this possible?","output":"To determine if La Reine d'Angleterre can partition the Chambre des Lords into two groups such that each Lord has at most one enemy in their group, we will employ a strategy based on reducing the number of internal enmity relations by reassigning Lords to different groups when necessary. **1. Initial Setup:**  Let's denote the Lords and their enmity relations by a graph ( G = (V, E) ) where ( V ) represents the Lords and ( E ) represents the pairs of enemies (edges). Each node in the graph has a degree at most 3, implying each Lord has at most three enemies. **2. Bipartite Graph Concept:**  We need to check if this graph can be partitioned into two groups such that within each group, no Lord has more than one enemy. This is akin to checking if the graph is almost bipartite, with the additional constraint that each vertex can have at most one neighbor within the same partition. **3. Strategy:** - Start with any arbitrary assignment of the Lords into two groups, ( A ) and ( B ). - Count the number of edges that connect Lords within the same group (internal enmity relations within groups), let's call this number ( k ). - If ( k = 0 ), then we have achieved our goal since there are no enemies within the groups. **4. Reducing ( k ):**  If ( k > 0 ), then there exists at least one Lord in each group with more than one enemy in its current group.  - Identify such a Lord and switch this Lord to the opposite group.    - **Reasoning**: When a Lord with two enemies within its current group is switched to the other group, it will now have those two enemies in the opposite group, thereby removing at least one internal enmity relation. - Recompute ( k ). **5. Iterative Process:** This process is guaranteed to reduce ( k ): - Initially, each switch decreases ( k ) by at least 1. - Iterate the process until ( k ) becomes 0. **6. Termination and Conclusion:** Since ( k ) cannot be less than 0 and decreases with each reassignment operation, the process must terminate.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the bullet train in m/s is: 69 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 69 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 69 * (10 / 36) m/s 69 * (5 / 18) m/s (69 * 5) / 18 m/s 345 / 18 m/s 19.1667 m/s (approximately) The bullet train takes 10 seconds to pass the man, and the train is 200 meters long. Therefore, the relative speed at which the train passes the man is the length of the train divided by the time taken: Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 200 m / 10 s Relative speed = 20 m/s The relative speed is the combined speed of the train and the man since they are moving in opposite directions. We already know the speed of the train, so we can find the speed of the man by subtracting the train's speed from the relative speed: Speed of man = Relative speed - Speed of train Speed of man = 20 m/s - 19.1667 m/s Speed of man = 0.8333 m/s (approximately) To convert the man's speed back to km/h, we use the conversion factor in reverse: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h Speed of man in km/h = 0.8333 m/s * 3.6 km/h Speed of man in km/h = 3 km/h (approximately) Therefore, the speed of the man is approximately boxed{3}  km/h."},{"instruction":"Calculate the arithmetic mean of the first nine powers of 3, starting from 3^1 to 3^9.

The operations involve incrementing or decrementing each element in a selected row or column by 1 simultaneously. The objective is to determine if such operations can transform all elements of the matrix ( A ) to zero. 1. **Analysis of Operations:**      - Assume we perform operations on each row ( i ) and each column ( j ), defined as ( x_i ) and ( y_j ) respectively. After several operations, the element ( a_{ij} ) at position ( (i,j) ) can be described as:     [     a_{ij} = x_i + y_j     ]     where ( x_i ) and ( y_j ) are integers and can be any integers. 2. **Uniqueness of Elements:**     - Since each ( a_{ij} ) is unique in the matrix ({1, 2, ldots, p^2}), it means that the values of ( x_i ) and ( y_j ) must also be unique considering all pairs ( (i, j) ). Without loss of generality, we can assume:     [     x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_p      ]     Similarly, we can order the ( y_j ) values:     [     y_1 < y_2 < cdots < y_p     ] 3. **Matrix Structure:**     - Construct the initial matrix assuming a sorted order for clarity. Subsequently, we need to check if through row and column operations (incrementing or decrementing all elements of a row or column by the same number), we can transition the matrix elements from ({1, 2, ldots, p^2}) to ({0, 0, ldots, 0}). 4. **Conflicts and Permutations:**     - What if the first row has elements (1, 2, ldots, p)? This structure means (a_{11} = 1), (a_{12} = 2), and (a_{1p} = p). For other rows, transitions should maintain uniqueness. For (frac{2p}{k}) blocks (modify one or multiple operations, i.e., entry into rows/columns):          Consider permutations for rows and columns since rows and columns can be swapped without altering the matrix properties effectively. 5. **Considering Column Operations:**     - Transitioning first row meaningfully via adding or subtracting complete rows by ( k ):     [     P1, P2, ldots, Pp-1     ] 6. **Number of Good Matrices:**:     - Each combination where swapping does not affect formed blocks.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein are performing their annual festive show. There is a field divided into  n times n  squares, in which the bottomleft square contains a red house with  k  Swiss gymnasts, and the topright square contains a blue house with  k  Liechtensteiner gymnasts. Every other square only has enough space for a single gymnast at a time. Each second either a Swiss gymnast or a Liechtensteiner gymnast moves. The Swiss gymnasts move to either the square immediately above or to the right and the Liechtensteiner gymnasts move either to the square immediately below or to the left. The goal is to move all the Swiss gymnasts to the blue house and all the Liechtensteiner gymnasts to the red house, with the caveat that a gymnast cannot enter a house until all the gymnasts of the other nationality have left. Determine the largest  k  in terms of  n  for which this is possible.","output":"1. **Determine the largest possible value of ( k ) for which the goal is achievable:**    The largest possible value is ( k = (n-1)^2 ). This is achievable because the ((n-1)^2) squares in the top-left portion of the grid can contain all ((n-1)^2) Liechtensteiner gymnasts while the Swiss gymnasts enter the blue house (one at a time) by moving along the empty squares. 2. **Consider ( k > (n-1)^2 ):**    Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume the first gymnast to enter a new house is Swiss. To reach the goal, there must be a point in time where all ( k ) Liechtensteiner gymnasts are in neither house. This must occur before the first Swiss gymnast enters the blue house. Furthermore, all ( k ) Swiss gymnasts must leave the red house before any of the Liechtensteiner gymnasts can enter. 3. **Claim:**    Suppose some Swiss gymnast leaves the red house while all ( k ) Liechtensteiner gymnasts are in neither house. Then, as long as the red house is not empty, it is impossible for this gymnast to reach the blue house.    **Proof:**    Since none of the Liechtensteiner gymnasts can enter the red house, there are at most     [    (n^2 - 2) - k le 2n - 4    ]    unoccupied squares on the grid.     Since all paths from the red house to the blue house require ( 2(n-1) ) moves, any Swiss gymnast must pass through ( 2n-3 ) unoccupied squares along the way. This is a contradiction because there are not enough unoccupied squares for the Swiss gymnast to reach the blue house. Hence, the claim follows.  4. **Define the set ( T ):**    Let ( T ) denote the set containing all ( k ) Liechtensteiner gymnasts and all Swiss gymnasts that were still in the red house right after the last Liechtensteiner gymnast left the blue house. Because no Swiss gymnast can enter the blue house until all ( k ) Liechtensteiner gymnasts have exited, there are at least     [    k - [(n^2 - 2) - k] = 2k + 2 - n^2    ]    Swiss gymnasts in ( T ). 5. **Analyze the set ( T ):**    No gymnasts in ( T ) can enter a new house until all Swiss gymnasts in the set have exited the red house. This implies that at some point in time, there must have been no gymnasts in ( T ) inside a house. Therefore,     [    |T| le n^2 - 2    ]    must hold. Hence,     [    n^2 - 2 ge |T| ge k + (2k + 2 - n^2) = 3k + 2 - n^2    ]    must hold.

We then subtract this probability from 1 to find the probability that the product is divisible by 8.  Step 1: Calculate the probability that the product is not divisible by 2. For the product to not be divisible by 2, all eight numbers rolled must be odd. Each die has three odd numbers (1, 3, 5). The probability of rolling an odd number on one die is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}. The probability that all eight dice show odd numbers is: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^8 = frac{1}{256}. ]  Step 2: Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 2 but not by 4. For the product to be divisible by 2 but not by 4, exactly one die must show a number with exactly one factor of 2 (i.e., the number 2 itself), and the other seven dice must show odd numbers. The probability of rolling a 2 on one die is frac{1}{6}, and the probability of rolling an odd number on one die is frac{1}{2}. Thus, the probability for this case, considering there are binom{8}{1} = 8 ways to choose which die shows the 2, is: [ 8 times left(frac{1}{6}right) times left(frac{1}{2}right)^7 = 8 times frac{1}{6} times frac{1}{128} = frac{8}{768} = frac{1}{96}. ]  Step 3: Calculate the probability that the product is divisible by 4 but not by 8. This occurs if there are exactly two or three dice showing the number 2 (and no die showing 4 or 6).

We are required to show that after performing a sequence of pinching operations, transforming mathcal{P}_6 into a sequence of convex polygons, mathcal{P}_n, the area of each resultant polygon mathcal{P}_n remains greater than frac{1}{2} for all n geq 6. 2. **Pinching Operation Description**:    - Pinching a convex n-corner involves choosing two neighboring sides, (overline{AB}) and (overline{BC}).    - Two points, (M in overline{AB}) and (N in overline{BC}), are selected.    - The sides (overline{AB}) and (overline{BC}) are replaced by (overline{AM}), (overline{MN}), and (overline{NC}), thus cutting off a corner and increasing the polygon's corners by 1, resulting in an (n+1)-corner polygon. 3. **Convex Hull and Area Argument**:    - By continually pinching, we generate polygons ( mathcal{P}_7, mathcal{P}_8, ldots ) from (mathcal{P}_6).    - Even after these operations, there are always six sides in (mathcal{P}_n) that remain subsegments of the sides of (mathcal{P}_6) since points (M) and (N) are always chosen within the original segments.    - Choosing any inner point from each of these sides, the convex hull H formed by these points is contained within mathcal{P}_n.  4. **Hexagon Area Preservation**:    - Convex hull H of the six chosen points involves these points lying on different sides of the original hexagon mathcal{P}_6.    - To demonstrate that the area of H is greater than frac{1}{2}, we generalize and consider six points A_1, A_2, ldots, A_6, with each point on a different side of mathcal{P}_6.    - The area of triangle A_1A_2A_3 depends on the perpendicular distance from A_2 to line A_1A_3. With points fixed, the area is minimized by moving A_2 to a vertex of the hexagon. 5. **Repeated Area Minimization**:    - By iterating this process, examining the other sequences of two adjacent points, the least possible area of the resulting figure is considered at the vertices of mathcal{P}_6.    - Given that the vertices of H are not exactly at the original vertices but rather within the sides, the area H thus strictly holds more than frac{1}{2}. 6. **Conclusion**:    - Since the process ensures that H remains within mathcal{P}_n and H itself maintains an area greater than frac{1}{2}, it follows that the area of the resulting polygon mathcal{P}_n is always greater than frac{1}{2} regardless of the number of pinching operations performed. Hence, the continuous pinching process applied on a regular hexagon mathcal{P}_6 to generate mathcal{P}_n ensures that the area of mathcal{P}_n is always greater than frac{1}{2} for all (n geq 6). boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Compute the sum of the series: [ 2(1 + 2(1 + 2(1 + 2(1 + 2(1 + 2))))) ]","output":"The given expression is structured similar to the original problem but involves fewer terms and uses the base number 2 instead of 3.

The derivative f'(x) is given by: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x ln x) = 1 + ln x. At x = 1, we get: f'(1) = 1 + ln 1 = 1. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at (1, 0) is 1. Using the point-slope form of a line, y-y_1=m(x-x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the point on the line, we get the equation of the tangent line as: y = 1 cdot (x - 1) + 0, which simplifies to: y = x - 1.

Given that the total number of students in the class is 25, we have the relationship:    [    E + B = 25    ] 2. **Analysis of Statements by the First Group:**    - Five students claim that if they leave, more than half of the remaining students will be bullies.    - If one of these students leaves, the remaining number of students is 24.    - To satisfy their statement, more than half of the remaining 24 students should be bullies if one of them leaves. 3. **Calculation for the First Group:**    - If one student leaves, the number of remaining bullies is ( B ), and the number of remaining excellent students is ( E - 1 ).    - Hence, the statement is valid if:      [      B > frac{24}{2} = 12 quad Rightarrow quad B > 12      ] 4. **Analysis of Statements by the Second Group:**    - The remaining 20 students claim that if they leave, the ratio of bullies to excellent students among the remaining students will be 3:1.    - If one of them leaves, there will still be ( B ) bullies, and ( E - 1 ) excellent students but applicable only for a certain number of those who might have been lying. 5. **Calculation for the Second Group:**    - The equation for a student from the second group leaving is:      [      B = 3(E - 1)      ]    - Considering all possible values of ( E ) and ( B ):      [      B = 3E - 3      ]      and by substituting ( B = 25 - E ):      [      25 - E = 3E - 3      ]    - Solving this equation, we get:      [      25 + 3 = 4E quad Rightarrow quad 28 = 4E quad Rightarrow quad E = 7      ]    - Plugging ( E = 7 ) back into ( E + B = 25 ):      [      B = 25 - 7 = 18      ] 6. **Another Possible Solution:**    - Consider the case where there are no excellent students in the second group, i.e., all 20 are bullies:    - Hence, any non-lying claim by a student in the first group will confirm more than half the classmates left are bullies.    - In this scenario, all students in the first group (5 students) would be excellent students:      [      E = 5      ]    - Thus, the number of bullies would be:      [      B = 25 - 5 = 20      ] 7. **Verification of Valid Scenarios:**    - For ( E = 7 ):      - Calculate:        - One excellent student leaves, remaining: ( 6 ).        - Total remaining: ( 24 - 1 = 23 ).        - Calculation hence checks out.    - For ( E = 5 ):      - Calculate:        - One excellent student leaves, remaining: ( 4 ).        - Total remaining: ( 24 - 1 = 23 ).        - Calculation hence confirms more than half bullies. **Conclusion:**  The possible number of excellent students is either ( 5 ) or ( 7 ).

Let's denote the rates at which Dev, Tina, and Alex work as D, Ti, and A, respectively. The rate is the reciprocal of the time taken to complete the task, so we have: D = 1 / (T + 20) Ti = 1 / (T + 5) A = 1 / (T + 10) When Dev and Tina work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: D + Ti = 1 / T Substituting the expressions for D and Ti, we get: 1 / (T + 20) + 1 / (T + 5) = 1 / T To solve for T, we need to find a common denominator and combine the fractions: (T + 5 + T + 20) / [(T + 20)(T + 5)] = 1 / T (2T + 25) / [(T + 20)(T + 5)] = 1 / T Cross-multiplying to get rid of the fractions, we have: 2T + 25 = (T + 20)(T + 5) / T Multiplying both sides by T to clear the denominator, we get: 2T^2 + 25T = (T + 20)(T + 5) Expanding the right side, we have: 2T^2 + 25T = T^2 + 25T + 100 Subtracting T^2 + 25T from both sides, we get: T^2 = 100 Taking the square root of both sides, we find: T = 10 Now we can find the time taken by Dev, Tina, and Alex when they work alone: Dev alone: T + 20 = 10 + 20 = 30 hours Tina alone: T + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 hours Alex alone: T + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20 hours The ratio of the time taken by Dev, Tina, and Alex if each of them worked alone to complete the task is: Dev : Tina : Alex = 30 : 15 : 20 To simplify the ratio, we can divide each term by the greatest common divisor of the three numbers, which is 5: Dev : Tina : Alex = 30/5 : 15/5 : 20/5 = 6 : 3 : 4 So the ratio of the time taken by Dev, Tina, and Alex if each of them worked alone to complete the task is boxed{6:3:4} ."},{"instruction":"Given that x=2 is a solution of the equation frac{k}{{x3}}frac{1}{{3x}}=1, find the value of k.","output":"Given that x=2 is a solution of the equation frac{k}{{x-3}}-frac{1}{{3-x}}=1, we substitute x=2 into the equation to find the value of k.

We denote the angle angle DAP by alpha. 2. **Triangles and Symmetric Properties**:    By the problem's conditions, triangles ADP and ABP are isosceles triangles (as shown below). 3. **Using Trigonometric Ratios**:    Draw the altitudes AF and BG for triangles ADP and ABP, respectively. From the right triangles AFD and BGP, we get the following trigonometric relations:    [    sin frac{alpha}{2} = frac{a}{2}    ]    and     [    sin alpha = frac{1}{2a}.    ] 4. **Combined Equations**:    If we can find an angle alpha and a positive value a such that both equations hold, then such a rectangle exists.

Thus,    [    sin^2 frac{alpha}{2} = 1 - cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} = 1 - u^2.    ]    Therefore, the equation becomes:    [    (1 - u^2) u = frac{1}{8},    ]    which simplifies to:    [    u^3 - u + frac{1}{8} = 0.    ] 6. **Applying Bolzano's Theorem**:    Define the function:    [    f(alpha) = cos^3 frac{alpha}{2} - cos frac{alpha}{2} + frac{1}{8}.    ]    This function is continuous.

To determine the correct statement, we need to carefully analyze the conditions ( P ) and ( Q ). 1. **Understanding ( P ):**    - ( P ) states that the dihedral angles between neighboring faces of pyramid ( V-ABCD ) are all equal.    - This implies that the faces of the pyramid must meet at equal angles along their common edges. 2. **Understanding ( Q ):**    - ( Q ) states that the spatial angles between neighboring edges of the pyramid ( V-ABCD ) are all equal.    - This means that the three-dimensional angles formed at the vertex ( V ) where edges meet must be the same. 3. **Analyzing ( P ) and ( Q ):**    - Consider a pyramid whose base ( ABCD ) is a rectangle but not a square.      - If the apex ( V ) lies directly above the center of the rectangle and the pyramid is right-angled (a special case), the dihedral angles between the lateral faces may be equal. Thus, ( P ) holds in this case.      - However, the spatial angles formed between edges meeting at vertex ( V ) will not necessarily be the same if it is not a regular square base (since the base lengths differ).

Therefore, ( Q ) does not imply ( P ).

Squaring both sides of equation (1) gives us  4x^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.  We can equate this expression to 2(a^2 - b^2) from equation (2), which yields  a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2a^2 - 2b^2.  This simplifies to  2ab + b^2 = a^2 - b^2.  Bringing terms involving b to one side and terms involving a to the other side, we get  a^2 - 2ab - b^2 = 0.

The problem requires us to find how many five-digit natural numbers are divisible by 9, where the last digit is 2 more than the penultimate digit. 2. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. 3. Let the five-digit number be represented as (abcde), where (a, b, c, d, e) are its digits and (a neq 0) (since it’s a five-digit number). 4. We are given that the last digit (e) is 2 more than the penultimate digit (d). Therefore, (e = d + 2). 5. We need to consider the values that (d) can take. Since (e) must be a single digit, (d) can only take values from 0 to 7 inclusive (because adding 2 to 8 or 9 would no longer result in a single digit for (e) which should be in the range from 0 to 9).     - If (d = 0), then (e = 2)     - If (d = 1), then (e = 3)     - If (d = 2), then (e = 4)     - If (d = 3), then (e = 5)     - If (d = 4), then (e = 6)     - If (d = 5), then (e = 7)     - If (d = 6), then (e = 8)     - If (d = 7), then (e = 9)    In summary, (d) has 8 possible values from 0 to 7. 6. Now, the condition for divisibility by 9 means (a + b + c + d + e) should be a multiple of 9.     - Given (e = d + 2), the sum (a + b + c + d + e = a + b + c + d + (d + 2) = a + b + c + 2d + 2). 7. For (a + b + c + 2d + 2) to be divisible by 9, the values of (a, b,) and (c) can freely vary from 0 to 9 (as they do not restrict the possibility when combined with (d ) values). 8. However, (a) cannot be zero since it's a five-digit number. Thus, (a) ranges from 1 to 9, and (b) and (c) range from 0 to 9. 9.

To prove that there is at least one team that lost to no more than four other teams among all 109 other teams, we proceed as follows: 1. **Lemma**: Let ( k geq 55 ), and assume that among any ( k ) teams, there is at least one team that lost to no more than four of the other ( k-1 ) teams. Then, it follows that among any ( k+1 ) teams, there is at least one team that lost to no more than four of the other ( k ) teams. 2. **Proof of the Lemma**:     - Assume for contradiction that among any set ( M ) of ( k+1 ) teams, we cannot find a single team that lost to no more than four of the other ( k ) teams.     - Consider the set ( M = { C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{k+1} } ).     - For each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k+1 ), if we remove team ( C_i ) from ( M ), among the remaining ( k ) teams, by our initial assumption, there exists at least one team ( C_j ) that lost to no more than four of these ( k-1 ) teams.     - Since ( C_j ) is not the required team for the entire ( M ), it must have also lost to team ( C_i ), meaning it lost to exactly five teams from ( M ).     - Denote such a team ( C_j ) as a suitable team for team ( C_i ).     - Every team from ( M ) that fits the criteria for at least one other team must have lost to no more than five of the ( k+1 geq 56 ) teams.     - Therefore, each suitable team lost to exactly five other teams in ( M ). 3. **Counting the Matches**:     - The number of matches among suitable teams is (frac{1}{2} s(s-1) ). In each match, one team loses.     - For each suitable team, this means it lost in at least (frac{1}{2} s(s-1) / s = frac{s-1}{2} geq 5.5) matches, implying it lost to at least six different teams, which contradicts the earlier condition. This contradiction shows that among any ( k+1 ) teams, there is indeed at least one team that lost to no more than four of the other ( k ) teams. 4. **Induction**:     - **Base Case**: When ( k = 55 ), this is true by the problem's condition.     - **Inductive Step**: Assuming the statement is true for any ( k geq 55 ), by the above lemma, it holds for ( k+1 ).     By mathematical induction, this statement holds for all ( k ) from 55 up to 110.

In one of these stacks, a coin has been replaced with a coin of a different weight, but this coin is indistinguishable from the others in appearance. 1. **Identify Two Equal Stacks**:    - To leverage the balance scale efficiently in just one weighing, we need to create two groups of equal number of coins. Let’s consider moving a coin:      - Take one coin from the stack of 7 coins and place it into the stack of 5 coins.      - Now we have two modified stacks:        - Stack A: Originally 5 coins, now 6 coins (after adding 1 coin from the stack of 7 coins).        - Stack B: Originally 7 coins, now 6 coins (after removing 1 coin).         2. **Perform the Weighing**:    - Place these two modified stacks (each with 6 coins now) on the balance scale.    - **Possible Outcomes**:      1. **Balance is Achieved**:          - If the scale balances, it indicates that the coins in both modified stacks A (originally 5 + 1) and B (originally 7 - 1) are identical in weight.          - Since the only modification was the exchange of a coin, the replaced coin must be consistent with the other coins in terms of weight.          - Thus, the original stacks (5 coins and 7 coins) contain the genuine coins.      2. **Balance is Not Achieved**:          - If the scale does not balance, it indicates a weight discrepancy due to the presence of the differing coin within these two modified stacks.          - Therefore, the original unmodified stacks (6 coins and 19 coins) must contain only genuine coins. 3. **Conclusion**:    - Based on the result of the balance scale:      - If balance is achieved, the two stacks with genuine coins are the ones originally with 5 and 7 coins.      - If balance is not achieved, the two stacks with genuine coins are the ones originally with 6 and 19 coins.

If half the maximum amount is 1200/2 = 600, and three times as many people donated this amount, then the number of people who donated 600 would be: 3 * 500 people = 1500 people The total amount from these 600 donations would be: 1500 people * 600/person = 900,000 Now, let's add the total amounts from both groups of donations: 600,000 (from 1200 donations) + 900,000 (from 600 donations) = 1,500,000 These donations accounted for 40% of the total money that Tim raised. To find the total amount of money raised, we can set up the equation: 40% * Total Money Raised = 1,500,000 To find the Total Money Raised, we divide the amount from donations by 40% (or 0.40 in decimal form): Total Money Raised = 1,500,000 / 0.40 Total Money Raised = 3,750,000 Therefore, Tim raised a total of boxed{3,750,000}  for his campaign for governor."},{"instruction":"Find the largest negative integer x which satisfies the congruence 42x + 30 equiv 26 pmod{24}.","output":"We start by simplifying the given congruence: [ 42x + 30 equiv 26 pmod{24}. ] Since 42 equiv 18 pmod{24} and 30 equiv 6 pmod{24}, the equation simplifies to: [ 18x + 6 equiv 26 pmod{24}. ] Subtract 6 from both sides: [ 18x equiv 20 pmod{24}. ] We can divide through by 2 to simplify further: [ 9x equiv 10 pmod{12}. ] To solve 9x equiv 10 pmod{12}, we look for the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 12.

Substituting sin^2 varphi = 1 - cos^2 varphi = 1 - x^2, we have: [ p sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2R (1 - x^2) + r - rx ] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root: [ p^2 (1 - x^2) = left(2R (1 - x^2) + r - rxright)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ p^2 (1 - x^2) = left(2R - 2Rx^2 + r - rxright)^2 ] [ p^2 (1 - x^2) = (2R - 2Rx^2 + r - rx)^2 ] Now, consider x = 1; hence cos varphi = 1 which leads to varphi = 0, rendering cot (varphi / 2) undefined. Therefore, x = 1 is not of interest. Subtract 1 - x from both sides to obtain a cubic polynomial: [ p^2 (1 - x)^2 = (1 - x^2)(2R(1 - x) + r)^2 ] We factor out (1 - x) from both sides: [ p^2 (1 - x) = (2R (1 - x) + r) (2R (1 - x) + r) ] Simplify further reaching a cubic equation. Upon verification against results from problem sets like 12.38 and 12.39, we find the similarity to: [ (x - cos alpha)(x - cos beta)(x - cos gamma) = 0 ] where alpha, beta, gamma are the angles of a triangle. Therefore, the cosine of the angle varphi must match the cosine of one of the triangle's angles.

From the distance formula: [ x^2 + (y - 9)^2 + z^2 = d^2, quad (x - 4)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = d^2, quad (x + 4)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = d^2. ] Subtracting the last two equations, simplifying gives x = 0. Substituting x = 0 in the first equation and comparing with the others, we find y = 0. The remaining equation simplifies to 81 + z^2 = d^2, and since d = 15 (as PB = 15), z^2 = 15^2 - 81 = 144, thus z = 12.  The base area of triangle{ABC} is frac{1}{2} times 8 times 9 = 36.

Then:    - The base of the pyramid must be a cyclic polygon. This follows because the spherical surface intersects the plane of the base in a circle.    - The center of the sphere is equidistant to all the vertices of the base polygon and the apex of the pyramid. Denote the center of the sphere by ( O ). 3. **Sufficient Condition**: Suppose the base of the pyramid is a cyclic polygon, and let ( O_{c} ) be the center of this circumcircle of the base.    - Draw a perpendicular from ( O_{c} ) to the plane containing the base, and extend this line to find a point ( O ) such that ( O ) is equidistant from the apex and each vertex of the base polygon.    - If such a point ( O ) exists, then ( O ) is the center of the circumscribed sphere. To summarize: - **If a sphere is circumscribed around the pyramid**:   - The base must be a cyclic polygon.   - The center of the sphere is equidistant from all the vertices of the base and from the apex of the pyramid. - **Conversely, if the base is a cyclic polygon and we can find a point on the perpendicular from the circumcenter of the base to the plane of the base that is equidistant from the apex and all vertices of the base**:   - Such a point is the center of a sphere circumscribed around the pyramid.

Depending on x:    - If x leq 1, then the median is 1.    - If 1 < x < 5, the median is x.    - If x geq 5, the median is 5. 4. **Forming an Arithmetic Progression (AP)**:    - **Case 1: Median is 1** (x leq 1):      The sequence 1, 1, frac{24+x}{7} must be an AP with equal terms:      [      frac{24+x}{7} = 1 implies 24 + x = 7 implies x = -17.      ]      Check x leq 1, which is valid.        - **Case 2: Median is 5** (x geq 5):      The sequence 1, 5, frac{24+x}{7} must be an AP with common difference 4:      [      frac{24+x}{7} = 5 + 4 = 9 implies 24 + x = 63 implies x = 39.      ]      Check x geq 5, which is valid.        - **Case 3: Median is x** (1 < x < 5):      The sequence 1, x, frac{24+x}{7} must be an AP. Thus:      [      frac{24+x}{7} = 2x - 1 implies 24 + x = 14x - 7 implies 13x = 31 implies x = frac{31}{13}.      ]      Check 1 < frac{31}{13} < 5, which is valid. 5. **Sum of Possible Values of x**:    [    (-17) + 39 + frac{31{13} = 22 + frac{31}{13} = frac{315}{13}}    ] The final answer is boxed{B}"},{"instruction":"Triangle PQR has PQ = 12 and PR: QR = 25: 24.
