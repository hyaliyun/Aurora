In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).

In this situation, the innate immune system is confronted with mixed signals, those from apoptotic cells and those from the infecting pathogen. Nuclear receptor activation has been implicated downstream of apoptotic cell recognition while Toll-like receptors are the prototypical inflammatory receptors engaged during infection. When the two signals combine, a new set of events takes place beginning with transrepression of a subset of inflammatory-response genes and ending with the induction of a T helper-17 adaptive immune response. This response is best suited for clearing the infecting pathogen and repairing the damage that occurred to the host tissue during infection..

Q:Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the events of the story, the NRA still: Options: - harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement. - is critical and wary of any political movements that call for political change on the topic of gun rights. - not enough information - is unwilling to compromise and agree to any law or reform that compromises the right to own guns.

E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental 'slop'(\\" does answer the question \\"Who was one early naysayer of Humanism?\\" as it mentions three early 20th-century critics who held a negative view towards humanism. To provide a more detailed answer: Ezra Pound, Thomas Ernest Hulme, and Thomas Stearns Eliot were prominent literary figures and critics during the early 20th century, each with their own influential contributions to literature and critical thought. 1. Ezra Pound (1885-1972) was an American poet and critic, and he played a major role in shaping modernist literature. As a part of the Imagist movement, he valued precision in imagery and clear, concise language. He was critical of humanism because he believed that its emphasis on sentimentality led to an excess of emotionalism, a lack of clarity, and verbosity in writing. Pound considered this \\"slop\\" as it detracted from the purity and artistic integrity of literature. 2. T. E. Hulme (1883-1917) was an English poet and literary critic, known for his association with the Imagist movement and his influence on modernist poetry. Hulme shared Pound's dislike for humanism, agreeing that its focus on emotions and individual subjective experiences made it sentimental and indulgent. Hulme called for a return to classicism, with its emphasis on restraint, discipline, and strict formal structure, thus promoting a new direction for poetry at odds with humanist principles. 3. T. S. Eliot (1888-1965) was an American-born British poet, essayist, playwright, and literary critic. He is commonly regarded as one of the most significant and influential literary figures of the 20th century. Eliot was also critical of humanism and its excessive emotionalism. As a modernist writer, he sought to explore deeper psychological and spiritual themes in his work. He believed that humanism was overly focused on emotional expression and failed to address the complexities and challenges of modern human experience. The sentence you provided gives three examples of early naysayers of humanism: Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot. Each of these critics held a negative view of humanism, believing that it promoted sentimentality and hindered the development of modernist literature. By rejecting humanism, these literary critics contributed to the emergence of new forms and styles of literature that shaped the course of 20th-century writing and literary criticism."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What was the last name of the art historian who stated that  the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga. The Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.The Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \\"Balhara\\" status as \\"one among the four principal Kings of the world\\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings. The Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is Karnata Dravida according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the Shikharas common to the Nagara style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some...","output":"The last name of the art historian who stated that the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture is Brown.

Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. Question: According to Maume's analysis, who will probably have a poor night's sleep? - Teens who feel like talking with their parents. - Teens who have friends sharing their dreams. - Teens who feel contented about themselves. - Teens who lack a sense of security at school.

Ce rapport présente des informations statistiques et économiques concernant l'industrie du film, y compris les parts de marché et le soutien gouvernemental offert au cinéma canadien. Les données fournies dans ce document visent à donner un aperçu de l'état actuel du secteur du cinéma au Canada, ainsi que de l'aide financière et réglementaire apportée par les différents niveaux de gouvernement. L'industrie cinématographique canadienne occupe une place importante dans l'économie du pays. Elle génère non seulement des revenus substantiels, mais contribue également au rayonnement culturel du Canada à l'échelle internationale. Les films produits et réalisés au Canada sont souvent reconnus pour leur qualité et leur diversité, tant dans les festivals de cinéma du pays qu'à l'étranger. En ce qui concerne les parts de marché, les films canadiens sont souvent en concurrence avec des productions étrangères (principalement américaines) qui disposent de budgets plus importants et bénéficient d'une plus grande visibilité sur le marché. Cependant, les films canadiens parviennent régulièrement à obtenir une part de marché significative, grâce à une combinaison de facteurs tels que la qualité des scénarios, la performance des acteurs et le soutien des institutions gouvernementales. Le soutien gouvernemental pour le cinéma canadien est un élément essentiel de la vitalité de cette industrie. Il se traduit par différentes formes d'aides financières et de mesures incitatives, telles que des subventions, des crédits d'impôt et des programmes de financement destinés aux producteurs, réalisateurs et autres professionnels du secteur. Ces aides sont généralement gérées et distribuées par des organismes publics tels que Téléfilm Canada, la Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC) et le Fonds des médias du Canada (FMC). En plus du soutien financier, le gouvernement canadien met en place des régulations visant à protéger et promouvoir l'industrie cinématographique nationale. Par exemple, des quotas de diffusion de films canadiens sont imposés aux chaînes de télévision et aux plateformes de streaming, afin d'assurer une présence significative du contenu local dans les médias audiovisuels. En conclusion, le cinéma canadien bénéficie d'un soutien important de la part des gouvernements et de diverses institutions.

How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of unlocking the last story in Sonic Adventure 2, you would need to complete various tasks throughout Hero and Dark storylines. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you progress through the game and unlock the last story. 1. Choose a storyline: Sonic Adventure 2 consists of two primary storylines: Hero and Dark. The Hero story features Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as the playable characters, whereas the Dark story features Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge. You can choose to play either of these storylines first, but you'll need to complete both of them eventually to unlock the last story. Completing one storyline will not directly affect the other, so feel free to switch between them as you progress. 2. Complete each stage: As you play through the storylines, you will encounter various stages or levels that will require you to navigate through obstacles, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. Each character will have their own unique play style and stages that cater to their abilities. For example, Sonic and Shadow stages will focus on high-speed action, while Tails and Dr. Eggman stages will involve mech-based shooting, and Knuckles and Rouge stages will require you to find hidden items. You must complete each stage with a passing grade to move on to the next one. Keep in mind that some stages may require you to achieve specific objectives, such as defeating a boss or uncovering hidden items. 3. Collect A-rank emblems: Throughout the game, you will receive a performance-based ranking and an emblem for each stage you complete. These ranks range from E to A, with A being the highest. Collecting A-rank emblems for all stages in both Hero and Dark storylines will not only improve your overall game score but may also unlock additional content, such as costumes and bonus content. 4. Battle key bosses: At several points in the Hero and Dark storylines, you will need to defeat crucial bosses in order to progress. These boss battles will usually involve facing off against the counterpart from the opposing storyline, such as Sonic vs. Shadow or Tails vs. Dr. Eggman. Be prepared for challenging battles and utilize your character's abilities to defeat these bosses effectively. 5. Complete Hero and Dark storylines: Once you have completed all stages and defeated all bosses within the Hero and Dark storylines, you will unlock each story's individual ending. The ending of the storyline will depict a cutscene that gives context to the overarching plot and sets the stage for the last story. 6. Unlocking the last story: Upon completing both the Hero and Dark storylines, the game will present you with a new option: the Last story. This story combines the events and characters from both storylines into a final showdown that ultimately resolves the game's story. 7. Complete the last story: In the last story, you will play as a mix of characters from both Hero and Dark storylines. The gameplay mechanics will remain the same, but you will need to use your skills and knowledge acquired from playing through the previous stages to tackle the challenges in the last story. Successfully completing the last story means you have conquered the entirety of Sonic Adventure 2 and unlocked every piece of the narrative.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? otherwise good movie","output":"To determine the sentiment of the sentence \\"otherwise good movie,\\" one must consider the context in which it is being used. On its own, the adjective \\"good\\" gives a positive sentiment. However, the presence of the word \\"otherwise\\" in the sentence can lead to some ambiguity. This word can indicate that there was something in the movie that was not favorable or perhaps a point of criticism. In the context of a longer text or conversation, the sentiment could be swayed in either direction based on the message the speaker or writer wants to communicate. It would also depend on the tone and manner of delivery. In general, the core sentiment (focusing primarily on the adjective \\"good\\") of the sentence leans towards a positive outlook, as it implies that the movie was overall enjoyable or well-made. However, the inclusion of \\"otherwise\\" introduces the possibility that there was a flaw or drawback to the film, which slightly weakens the positivity without negating it completely. To summarize, the sentiment of the sentence \\"otherwise good movie\\" is mostly positive, but there's a slight hint of negativity due to the presence of the word \\"otherwise.\\" However, understanding the full extent of the sentiment would require taking the context and tone of the surrounding discussion or text into account."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The string will attach to the door and hook, and as the door opens, the string will become tight, stopping the door from opening too far.

Dionnas cousin asks to be taken home and Vinny offers to give her a ride, allowing Dionna to stay. We soon discover the real reason he offered to take her home was to have sex with her in the back seat of his car. However, before he can finish, the two are scared off by another couple in the car behind him. As Vinny speeds off, the killer comes out of the bushes and kills the couple.While driving Dionna home, she begins questioning what took Vinny so long to drive her cousin home. Vinny offers the excuse that he had to urinate but before she can question him further, they arrive at the exact same spot where Vinny was having his affair, only now it is a crime scene. Vinny goes to investigate and to his horror, it is the same couple that scared him off. Vinny begins vomiting as he gets back to the car, telling Dionna that the .44 Caliber Killer is back.

Write a question about the following article: The Broncos' defense limited Titans' quarterback Marcus Mariota to only 88 yards passing on 6 of 20 attempts; however, the Titans controlled the first half time of possession by a 2-1 margin and led 10-0 in the first quarter. Running back DeMarco Murray rushed for a 1-yard touchdown and placekicker Ryan Succop kicked a 53-yard field goal; the latter scoring play occurred after the Titans' defense forced a fumble off Broncos' running back Justin Forsett. A 41-yard field goal by Succop just before halftime gave the Titans a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' offense did not cross midfield in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, the Broncos were attempting to cut into the Titans' lead early in the fourth quarter, but the Titans' defense stopped the Broncos on a 4th-and-goal. After forcing a Titans' punt, the Broncos finally got on the scoreboard with ten minutes remaining in the game, with quarterback Trevor Siemian connecting on a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders. After forcing a three-and-out from the Titans, the Broncos marched down to as far as the Titans' 16-yard line, but had to settle on a 34-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus to narrow the Titans' lead to 13-10 with 4:33 remaining in the game. After forcing another Titans' punt, the Broncos had one last possession, hoping for a rally. With 1:04 remaining in the game, Siemian completed a pass to tight end A. J.

Write an article based on this \\"Learn to “hold the reins. Learn to make a “lasso. Learn the pattern.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering the Art of Horse Riding: Holding the Reins, Crafting a Lasso, and Learning the Pattern Introduction Horse riding has fascinated people for centuries - it is not just a means of transport, but also an engaging recreational activity and an integral part of many equestrian sports. Becoming a proficient horse rider involves mastering various essential skills, such as holding the reins properly, creating a lasso, and understanding intricate riding patterns. In this article, we'll explore these three crucial components and explain how they contribute to building a strong foundation for any aspiring equestrian. Step 1: Holding the Reins One of the first lessons a novice rider must learn is how to properly hold the reins, as it forms the foundation of effective communication and control between the rider and the horse. An incorrect grip can lead to poor communication, tension, and discomfort. Here's how to hold the reins correctly: 1. Hold the reins firmly but with relaxed hands to avoid tension and to maintain a flexible connection. 2. Place your hands in a position that is slightly above and ahead of the horse's withers (the highest point where the neck and back meet). 3. Your thumbs should rest on top of the reins, exerting slight pressure to maintain control. 4. Keep your wrists straight and supple, allowing for smooth movements. 5. Adjust your grip as needed, depending on the horse's level of responsiveness and the desired amount of control. By mastering how to hold the reins, riders can effectively communicate with their horses, achieving great harmony and rapport. Step 2: Crafting a Lasso A lasso, or lariat, is a valuable tool for horse riders, especially in activities like team penning, calf roping, and other cattle work. Skillfully using a lasso demonstrates a rider's expertise and precision. Here is a brief guide on making a lasso: 1. Select a suitable rope material, such as nylon or polypropylene, which offers durability, weight, and smoothness. 2. Cut the rope to the desired length (usually 30 to 40 feet for cattle work). 3. Create a fixed eye loop at one end of the rope by tying a reliable knot, like the bowline or Honda knot. 4. Attach a metal swivel snap to the fixed eye loop to allow for smoother roping action. 5. Coil the remaining length of the rope neatly for easy handling and storage. Crafting and mastering the use of the lasso takes practice, but it is a valuable skill that will enhance a rider's expertise in various equestrian activities. Step 3: Learning the Pattern In horse riding, \\"the pattern\\" often refers to a sequence of specific movements and gaits executed by the horse and rider. Routines may vary depending on the discipline, such as dressage, reining, or barrel racing. Learning the pattern entails understanding the rhythm and flow of each movement. Here are some tips: 1. Begin by observing experienced riders and their horses performing the pattern. 2. Break down the pattern into smaller, manageable sections for easier learning and practice. 3. Memorize the sequence and visualize performing it flawlessly. 4. Practice each section individually, gradually linking them together until you can execute the entire pattern smoothly. 5. Continuously refine your skills and focus on establishing harmony with your horse. Learning the pattern fosters an intuitive connection between rider and horse, enhancing the rhythm and precision of their performance. Conclusion Mastering the art of horse riding takes dedication, patience, and practice. By effectively holding the reins, crafting a lasso, and learning the pattern, novice riders can build a solid foundation for their equestrian journey. These essential skills will aid them in embracing various disciplines and deriving immense joy from the incredible bond formed between horse and rider."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step-by-step like we are talking to a 5-year old. We have the equation: -4 * a - 44 = 21 * a - 47 * a First, we simplify the equation by combining the terms with 'a' on both sides. On the right side, we have: 21 * a - 47 * a Imagine you have 21 apples and then someone takes away 47 apples from you. You can write it as: (21 - 47) * a now, 21 - 47 = -26, so it becomes: -26 * a Now, the equation looks like this: -4 * a - 44 = -26 * a Now, we want to move the \\"-4 * a\\" from the left side to the right side to have all the 'a' terms together. To do this, we can add 4 * a to both sides: (-4 * a - 44) + 4 * a = -26 * a + 4 * a -44 = -22 * a (because -26 * a + 4 * a = (-26 + 4) * a = -22 * a) Now we have to find the value of 'a'. We have: -44 = -22 * a To find 'a', we can divide both sides by -22: a = -44 / -22 Now, -44 divided by -22 equals 2: a = 2 So the solution to the math problem is a = 2."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The equation is: -1970 = -85*x - 2310 First, we need to move the 2310 to the other side of the equation. That means we'll add 2310 to both sides: -1970 + 2310 = -85*x - 2310 + 2310 This simplifies to: 340 = -85*x Now, to find the value of \\"x,\\" we need to get it alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by -85: 340 / -85 = (-85*x) / -85 This simplifies to: -4 = x So the answer to the equation is x = -4.

During the Hellenistic period, Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the Syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic Judaism, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koiné Greek. The reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the Alexandrian Jews had lost the ability to speak Hebrew and Aramaic.

Write an article with the title: \\"Pemex Cuts Spending to Shore Up Finances\\" Article:","output":"Title: Pemex Cuts Spending to Shore Up Finances Introduction Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state-owned oil and gas company, has unveiled plans to enact considerable spending cuts in response to the myriad financial challenges threatening the organization's long-term stability. With the global economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and fluctuating oil prices, Pemex has experienced significant financial distress that requires urgent intervention.  Background of Pemex's Financial Struggles As one of Mexico's largest companies and revenue sources, Pemex is a vital economic linchpin for the nation. However, the company's finances have been on shaky ground even before the pandemic took its toll on the oil industry. Aging infrastructure, declining production, and rising debt levels were already putting immense pressure on Pemex, and the collapse of oil prices in 2020 has only aggravated the situation. In recent years, Pemex has struggled under the weight of its enormous debt, which now stands at approximately 107 billion, making it one of the world's most-indebted state oil companies. As global demand for oil dropped dramatically due to the pandemic, crude prices plummeted, leading to a collapse in Pemex's revenue. Attempts to stabilize prices via an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have softened the impact but have not averted the crisis entirely. Pemex's Spending Cuts Plan To combat its financial woes, Pemex has unveiled a comprehensive cost-cutting plan with both short- and long-term measures designed to strengthen its financial position. These measures include: 1. Capital Expenditure Reduction: Pemex is cutting back on investments in new projects, exploration activities, and infrastructure maintenance, with a planned reduction of about 1.4 billion in capital expenditures. While necessary to protect cash flow, these cuts may adversely impact future oil production and revenue generation. 2. Operational Expenditure Reduction: The company has announced a 1.2 billion reduction in operational expenses. This includes streamlining operations, reducing third-party contracts, and trimming administrative costs. Pemex is likely to implement employee furloughs and layoffs as part of these cost-saving measures. 3. Delaying Debt Payments: Pemex is also looking to postpone debt payments and seeking extensions or renegotiations of existing loans to ease short-term pressure on its balance sheet. In an effort to avoid default, the Mexican government has offered guarantees for some of Pemex's new financing deals, providing investors extra security. 4. Government Support: As part of a wider economic stimulus package, the Mexican government has earmarked 6.1 billion in support for Pemex. This financial aid will assist the company in fulfilling its debt and pension obligations, maintaining core operations, and funding necessary upgrades to aging infrastructure. Long-term Ramifications and Challenges While Pemex's spending cuts and financial restructuring plan offer a pathway toward short-term financial stability and potentially mitigating potentially catastrophic consequences, several long-term challenges remain. Cuts to capital expenditures, in particular, may hinder future oil production levels, which could lead to reduced revenue in the long term. Additionally, Pemex must identify new sources of capital to fund critical projects, just as private investment in the sector is becoming increasingly scarce. Furthermore, Pemex must strike a delicate balance between streamlining its workforce and maintaining its social function as a major employer in Mexico. Any job losses from cost-cutting measures must be carefully managed to avoid causing severe social and economic upheaval. In conclusion, Petroleos Mexicanos' aggressive spending cuts are necessary measures in the face of current financial challenges. However, to guarantee the company's future resilience and success, Pemex must take a long-term strategic approach that includes modernization, diversification, and improved management practices. The road to financial recovery may be long and fraught, but these measures could ultimately save one of Mexico's most crucial assets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: This article: Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother.  In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.  A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\".  At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

This article: The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor. contains an answer for the question: What had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565?, what is it ?

This defeat took place in the Battle of Talikota, where the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates overpowered the Vijayanagara forces. This marked a turning point for the empire, which eventually disintegrated and came to an end in 1646.

Answer the following question: when did superman first appear in a comic book?","output":"Superman, one of the most iconic and enduring characters in the world of comic books, first appeared in \\"Action Comics #1,\\" which was published by Detective Comics, Inc. (later known as DC Comics) on April 18, 1938. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, who originally developed the concept in 1933. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, both high school friends from Cleveland, Ohio, initially worked together on a short-lived, self-published, fanzine titled \\"Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization\\" in 1932. Their early collaboration led to the development of a character named \\"The Superman,\\" a bald, telepathic villain with aspirations of world domination. This prototype was quite different from the character that we know and love today. In 1934, Siegel revised the concept and transformed \\"The Superman\\" into a hero with superhuman abilities, including incredible strength, speed, and the ability to leap long distances. Shuster designed the iconic costume, featuring a cape and a stylized \\"S\\" on the chest, that would later become one of the most recognizable symbols in pop culture history. After several unsuccessful attempts to get their character published, Siegel and Shuster finally sold the rights to Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. in 1938 for 130. The character's first appearance in \\"Action Comics #1\\" marked the beginning of the superhero genre that would dominate the world of comic books for decades to come. The story, titled \\"Superman: Champion of the Oppressed,\\" introduced readers to the character's origin as an alien from the planet Krypton who was sent to Earth by his father, Jor-El. Adopted by the human Kent family and raised as Clark Kent in the small town of Smallville, the character would eventually move to the bustling Metropolis city and work as a reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper. Alongside his human love interest, Lois Lane, and his alter ego, Superman, the character would go on to fight for truth, justice, and the American way. Over the years, Superman's character and storylines have evolved, encompassing various iterations, retellings, and adaptations across comic books, radio shows, television series, movies, and other forms of media. Superman's enduring appeal has cemented his status as the quintessential superhero and an important figure in modern mythology. In conclusion, Superman first appeared in \\"Action Comics #1,\\" published on April 18, 1938, and created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character's introduction in this groundbreaking publication laid the foundation for superheroes' impact and influence on the comic book industry and popular culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Identify the possible referents In this case, the possible referents for \\"she\\" are Emily and Anna. Step 2: Analyze the semantics and pragmatics of the sentence The sentence tells us that Emily asked Anna to stir the pot. The second clause provides a reason: because \\"she\\" forgot to do it. The most logical interpretation is that the person who forgot to do it would be the one asking someone else to take care of the task. Step 3: Determine the most likely referent Based on the contextual analysis, it is most likely that \\"she\\" refers to Emily, as she is the one who asked Anna to stir the pot because she forgot to do it herself.

Se poate observa clar că există cel puţin un motiv foarte important: pregătirea venirii guvernului mondial; iar al doilea motiv este încă o dată de a sădi un sentiment de culpabilitate în omul european şi în cel occidental, care sunt în mod eronat consideraţi responsabili pentru toate relele din lume. Translate to English English:","output":"It is evident that there is at least one very significant reason: preparing for the arrival of a global government. A second reason is, once again, to instill a sense of guilt in the European and Western individual, who are mistakenly considered responsible for all the world's ills. The clear observation of these two reasons highlights the presence of underlying motives and agendas in the world today. The idea of a global government represents a shift towards a more centralized and powerful authority that could potentially impact individual freedoms and the sovereignty of nations. By advocating for such a system, it would change the dynamic of international cooperation and reshape the political landscape. On the other hand, cultivating guilt in the European and Western population leads to the assignment of collective blame for the problems that exist around the world. Whether it is historical injustices, current conflicts, or environmental issues, this mindset fosters a sense of responsibility that may not be entirely warranted. In turn, this creates an environment where people feel compelled to act or make concessions out of guilt, often in ways that may not be in their best interest. The consequences of these two reasons can be significant on various levels, including socioeconomic, political, and human rights aspects. The shaping of a centralized global government could lead to a decrease in the decision-making power of individual nations, potentially affecting the autonomy of these countries and their ability to address the concerns of their citizens. Additionally, the susceptibility of individuals to feelings of guilt can drive them to take decisions or adopt positions that may prove detrimental to their own well-being or the well-being of their communities. In summary, the preparation for a global government and the cultivation of guilt in the European and Western individual are two important reasons that warrant attention. The implications of these motives are substantial, involving potential challenges to national sovereignty, individual freedoms, and the overall state of international cooperation. Recognizing these underlying reasons and being aware of their consequences is essential for understanding the complexities of the world we live in today and navigating the challenges that lie ahead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not  heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her.

Accused spy Anna Chapman wasn't the only suspected Russian agent on Facebook. A tipster with access to co-defendant Mikhail Semenko's Facebook photos sent us some of his pictures. Want to see an alleged spy in a Bill Clinton costume?      Ten people were arrested by the U.S. government on Monday and accused of spying for Russia. One of the indicted, Anna Chapman, had pictures from various social networking sites posted all over the internet today (you can see those photos at the bottom of this post). Unsurprisingly, another one of the ten defendants had a significant social networking presence: Mikhail Semenko, an Arlington, Va. travel agent.      Semenko, whose LinkedIn profile has already been the subject of media speculation, worked at a travel agency called Travel All Russia, where he had a reputation for being \\"'clumsy' and 'quirky,' but highly intelligent.\\" Our tipster, who knew him slightly, says he \\"was pretty much just super socially awkward... He always said weird jokes that no one really got. Probably super smart though.\\"      So, not exactly James Bond. He and his fellow defendants are facing charges of \\"conspiracy to act as agents of a foreign government while concealing that from the U.S. government\\"—not espionage or high treason. In fact, they may not have done much spying at all. To be sure, this wasn't necessarily their M.O.; Russia may have just been hoping for vague and limited access to policymaking circles, with no specific information-gathering objectives. But mostly, Semenko and others seem to have blended in so well as ordinary Americans that, like ordinary Americans, they didn't have a lot of access to state secrets.      Semenko's Facebook photos don't really contradict that. The Seton Hall graduate looks like most goofy 20-somethings, messing around with friends at parties. How many Russian master spies do you think have been photographed wearing \\"U.S.S.R.\\" t-shirts or Bill Clinton masks?      Then again, how many 20-somethings are accused of being spies?                  Anna Chapman Photos ||||| Are you one of alleged Russian sleeper spy Anna Chapman's 181 Facebook friends? Do you subscribe to her Twitter feed? She's @nycrentalsnews. What about one of her 150 connections on LinkedIn? Were you one of the five people who recommended her on LinkedIn?                  According to documents seized by the FBI , Chapman's key tasking was to \\"search and develop ties in policy making circles in the U.S.\\" and then send intelligence reports back to Moscow Center. In today's world, connections are made online.                  Chapman's Twitter feed offers a glimpse into how her own recruitment might work. As a real estate agent, she could gain intimate knowledge of her clients. She'd know their residences inside and out, and even be in a position to recommend where a technical agent might place a listening device. Her LinkedIn resume suggests she was a prodigious networker, attaching herself to groups like the Online Marketing Association, the eMarketing Association Network and others.                  On Facebook, one of Chapman's friends posted a news alert about her arrest and asked, in Russian, whether the Anna Chapman he knew was the same person who was caught in the dragnet. There was no reply.                  How many connections away were they from folks like me and you? Were the alleged spies directly connected on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn? (Not that I could tell.)                  Folks in the intelligence community want to forbid their people from using social media, believing it to be a counterintelligence risk of the first order. There is almost no training in how to use social media to figure out who the bad guys (or gals) might be.                  When journalists communicate with tipsters on Twitter, through direct messages, who's watching? This is a digital version of the following question: when an old college friend who now works for a foreign embassy invites you for drinks and gently probes you for information about the mood inside the West Wing, are you complicit?                  The technology the alleged spies used to communicate -- steganography, WiFi brush passes, and old, regular, high-frequency Morse code -- is quite antiquated and exploitable, provided the FBI knew where to look. You can find WiFi networks with your own cell phone, and the NSA and CIA have long used devices that can suck up data from both unencrypted and encrypted networks.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What sport changed leagues back to back?\\" is in \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Now, I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man.  Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of Julian Noble, tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: \\"I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town.\\" Brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright.

Please answer the following question: But what is teacher quality? How can one measure it reliably? An analysis is issued on a sample of data from a Texas school district. Experts argue convincingly that teacher effectiveness should be measured by students' gains on standardized tests: Mr. Smith is probably a better teacher than Ms. Brown if his students consistently improve their test scores more than hers do. Though this approach is appealing, there are tricky issues. For example, what if Ms. Brown teaches in a school where students score so high there is little room for improvement? The authors try to correct for this problem, as well as other sorts of measurement issues, to generate a measurement of teacher effectiveness. The paper is primarily concerned with how this measure is related to other observable characteristics. The first finding is that there is a large variation in teacher effectiveness: some teachers consistently have a larger impact on their students' achievement than others. Second, easily observable characteristics like having a master's degree or a passing score on the teacher certification exam are not correlated with teacher effectiveness. Then what does matter? The most important single influence is experience: first-year teachers are much less effective than others. The second year is significantly better, and by the fourth year, _ . It is not entirely clear whether this experience effect is learning by doing (the more you teach, the more effective you become) or survival of the fittest (those who are not good at teaching tend to drop out early.) From my reading of the paper, both effects appear important and there is no simple answer. The data do suggest, however, that teacher effectiveness is pretty clear by the end of the second year, so the information to make an informed decision is available at that time. The authors also investigate the contentious issue of racial matching of students and teachers. Here they find strong evidence that minority teachers tend to be more effective with minority students.

Given the question: Process: - Items that can be reused are placed into recycling containers - Recycling trucks pick up the items that are able to be reused - The recyclable items travel to a recycling plant - The items are sorted by what they are made of - The items are broken down into small parts - The small parts are melted to make new raw parts - The raw parts are sold to manufactures to make new items.  Question: suppose energy cost increase and the plant has to lower its capacity to save money happens, how will it affect LESS recyling.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"More Effect When energy costs increase and a recycling plant has to lower its capacity to save money, the recycling process is likely to be affected significantly as a result. This can lead to less recycling, as the plant may have to reduce the number of items it can process, requiring more focused prioritization based on the most valuable and easily recycled materials. If the recycling plant cannot maintain its previous output, it will lead to several consequences that contribute to less recycling: 1. Collection process: With the reduced capacity of the recycling plant, recycling trucks may have to pick up fewer items to prevent overloading the plant. This can result in longer intervals between collections, causing some recyclable items to be discarded in regular trash due to lack of storage space or frustration from households and businesses. 2. Sorting and processing: As the recycling plant deals with less capacity, it might need to streamline its sorting process to focus on the most common or valuable materials to maximize efficiency. This means that some items, especially those made of mixed or less valuable materials, might not get recycled at all, further reducing the amount of materials that can be reused. 3. Raw material production: With a decrease in the processing capacity of the recycling plant, the output of raw materials produced from recycled items will also decrease. This in turn will lead to an increased demand for raw materials derived from non-recycled sources, such as mining or logging. Unfortunately, this can result in further environmental damage and resource depletion. 4. Market effects: Manufacturers that rely on raw materials from recycling plants will face a reduced supply, potentially increasing the costs of production. This can lead to higher prices for recycled products, making them less attractive to both consumers and businesses. Consequently, this may result in a decrease in demand for recycled goods, further discouraging recycling and potentially causing a vicious cycle of less recycling and higher non-recycled material use. 5. Financial strain on recycling plants: As recycling plants strive to save money due to increasing energy costs, they might have to cut back on staff, maintenance, or equipment upgrades, impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the recycling process. This could lead to a further reduction in recycling rates, as other recycling facilities might face the same challenges and also reduce their capacity. In conclusion, when energy costs increase and a recycling plant has to lower its capacity to save money, it could significantly affect the amount of recycling, creating a more significant effect on the entire recycling process and its desired outcomes. This can lead to a potential increase in waste accumulation, environmental damage, and a shift away from recycling as a viable solution to waste management."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Last month, Mr Adams said he had asked his solicitor to contact the PSNI on the matter and said he was available to speak to them if they wished to speak with him.      Mr Adams denies any involvement in the murder of the Belfast mother-of-ten.      Speaking tonight, he said he had no role whatsoever in what was one of the most controversial murders of the Troubles.      In a statement, Mr Adams said while he had concerns about timing, he is \\"voluntarily meeting with the PSNI this evening\\".      He said that \\"well publicised, malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these.      \\"While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent of any part in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs McConville\\".

She also questioned the timing of \\"this latest decision by the PSNI\\" and said she believed it was “politically motivated and designed to damage Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin.\\"      Mrs McConville was abducted by an IRA gang after being accused of passing information to the British army and later shot in the back of the head and buried 80km from her home.      The IRA did not admit her murder until 1999.      Mrs McConville’s remains were found on Shelling Hill, beach, Co Louth in 2003.      Nobody has ever been charged with her murder. ||||| A woman in her late 50s has been arrested in connection with one of the most notorious murders of the Northern Ireland Troubles – the abduction, killing and secret burial of the west Belfast widow Jean McConville.      The 57-year-old woman was detained by police officers in the west of the city on Wednesday morning and taken to Antrim police station for questioning.      She has since been released pending a police report being sent to prosecutors.      McConville was the most famous of the \\"disappeared\\", up to 16 victims of the IRA who were murdered and then buried secretly across Ireland in the 1970s and 80s.      Last month a former IRA negotiator with the British government, Ivor Bell, was charged with aiding and abetting in the murder of the 37-year-old mother of 10. Bell, who is out on bail, denies any involvement.      McConville, a Protestant-born widow, was dragged out of her flat in front of her children by armed IRA members in the Divis area shortly before Christmas in 1972. The IRA only admitted they had killed her in 1999 after a high-profile campaign by families of the \\"disappeared\\".      The IRA alleged that she was an informer but an investigation by the former police ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan concluded the widow was not working for the security forces as an agent.      Her murder has cast a long shadow over the peace process and the political settlement in Northern Ireland. The former IRA hunger striker and one-time commander of the Provisionals in Belfast Brendan Hughes alleged that the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, gave the order that McConville be buried in secret and that the future leader of the republican movement came up with the idea of creating a covert IRA unit that would \\"disappear\\" suspected informants.      Adams has always denied any role in the murder and has protested that he was never in the IRA.      Hughes, a former friend of the Sinn Féin chief who died in 2008, made his allegation on a tape recording for the Belfast Project, an archive of testimonies from ex-IRA and loyalist paramilitaries who would speak frankly about their involvement in violent acts during the Troubles.      The case against Bell is allegedly centred on another tape recording for the archive, which was meant to become a groundbreaking historical project for Boston College in the United States. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland pursued the tapes through the courts in the US and have acquired some of the material which allegedly relates to the McConville murder. ||||| A tape recording of a deceased Belfast IRA commander in which Gerry Adams is accused of ordering the murder and secret burial of a widowed mother of 10 in 1972 will be broadcast for the first time this week.      A former IRA hunger striker, Brendan Hughes, alleges the Sinn Féin president was one of the heads of a unit that kidnapped, killed and buried west Belfast woman Jean McConville. Hughes, who died in 2008, is recorded as saying: \\"There was only one man who gave that order for that woman to be executed – and that man is now the head of Sinn Féin.\\" Hughes also says that Adams went to the McConville children after their mother was abducted and promised an internal IRA investigation. \\"That man is the man who gave the order for that woman to be executed. I did not give the order to execute that woman. He did.\\"      Adams is challenged on the BBC's Storyville programme over whether he was a senior Provisionals commander in Belfast at the time McConville was abducted, just before Christmas 1972. \\"That's not true,\\" Adams replies, adding that he has not \\"shirked\\" his own responsibilities in the conflict. The Sinn Féin leader has always insisted that he was never in the IRA.      In response to the tape, Adams, who is the Sinn Féin member for Louth in the Irish parliament, accuses his former friend of lying. \\"Brendan is telling lies,\\" Adams tells the programme. He adds: \\"I had no act or part to play in the abduction, killing or burial of Jean McConville or any of the others.\\"      An expert forensic detective tells the joint BBC Northern Ireland-RTE production that the IRA sometimes weighed bodies down with heavy stones to ensure that the corpses would not surface if the bogs they were buried in ever dried up.      Storyville reveals that the first of the \\"disappeared\\" to be found back in 1999, north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, had received the last rites from a Catholic priest. The priest saw Molloy tied naked to a bed and asked his captors if any of them had rosary beads that their prisoner could hold when he was to be shot.      Security sources in the Republic told the Observer last week that up to four additional men who were \\"disappeared\\" by the IRA have not yet been identified by the organisation set up to find the Troubles' missing victims. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) has so far found eight of the \\"disappeared\\", including McConville, but seven on their official list are still unaccounted for.      A spokesman for the ICLVR, Geoff Knupfer, said: \\"At this moment there is no information to suggest there is any addition to the list.\\" However, security sources insist that at least four IRA victims were buried in secret.

Let's break down the sentences to highlight the similarities and differences: 1. \\"In 1951, he appeared again with Secombe when they appeared on the same bill in variety.\\"    - \\"appeared again\\" implies that the subject has had previous experience or instances of performing with Secombe.    - \\"when\\" acts as a subordinating conjunction, connecting the two parts of the sentence.    - \\"appeared on the same bill\\" suggests that both performers were scheduled as part of a single event or show.    - \\"in variety\\" implies that the format of the performance was a variety show, which is a type of entertainment composed of different acts. 2. \\"In 1951, he performed with Secombe again, when they appeared on the same bill in variety.\\"    - \\"performed with Secombe again\\" also indicates that the subject had previous interactions or performances with Secombe.    - \\"when\\" serves the same purpose in this sentence, connecting the two parts.    - \\"appeared on the same bill\\" again suggests that they were part of the same event or performance.    - \\"in variety\\" has the same implication as in the first sentence, denoting the variety show format. In summary, both sentences describe the same scenario and convey the same meaning, even though they use slightly different phrasings. The main difference lies in the choice of words - \\"appeared\\" versus \\"performed\\" - but they do not significantly impact the overall meaning of the sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"No, these two questions are not inquiring about the same information. They are addressing two completely different topics - one is related to the Python programming language, specifically mathematical operations, and the other question is about the hiring practices of startup companies. Let's break down each question and provide detailed information on both topics. Question 1: To calculate 2+3 in Python, we don't need to import math. Why in case of square root? In Python, basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed directly with the built-in operators. In the case of calculating the sum of 2 + 3, it's as simple as using the \\"+\\" operator, like this: result = 2 + 3 However, when you want to calculate the square root of a number, it requires a different approach. Python does not provide a built-in operator specifically for finding the square root. That's why you need to use a math library function like sqrt(), which is available in the math module to perform this calculation. The math module provides a range of mathematical functions, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and other useful functions that go beyond the basic arithmetic operations. To use sqrt() from the math module, you'll need to import the module and then call the function like this: import math number = 9 square_root = math.sqrt(number) In this example, you first import the Python 'math' module, then you call its sqrt() function by passing the number whose square root you want to calculate. The result is stored in the variable 'square_root.' Question 2: Startup companies hire freshers? Startup companies are newly established businesses that are usually in the early stages of their development. They often hire freshers, which are recent graduates or entry-level professionals, for a variety of reasons: 1. Cost-effective: Hiring freshers can be more cost-effective compared to experienced professionals, as they usually demand lower salaries. Startups often have limited financial resources, and hiring freshers can help them manage their budget effectively. 2. Enthusiasm and energy: Freshers typically bring enthusiasm, energy, and a willingness to learn and adapt to new environments. Startups need employees who can contribute positively to the growth and development of the company. 3. Adaptability: Since freshers do not have prior experience in a specific domain or industry, they are more likely to be open to learning new things and adapting to the startup's culture and work environment. This adaptability can be valuable in the rapidly changing marketplace. 4. Growth opportunities: Startups offer excellent growth opportunities for freshers, including hands-on experience, the chance to work on a wide variety of projects, and the opportunity to quickly take up significant responsibilities. This can be an attractive proposition for fresh graduates looking to fast-track their careers. 5. Updated knowledge: Freshers often come straight from an educational institution and have the most recent knowledge in their field. They can bring new insights, ideas, and up-to-date technical skills to a startup company. In conclusion, these two questions address different topics: one discusses specific functions in the Python programming language, while the other focuses on the hiring practices of startup companies. Each question demands separate and detailed information to provide a thorough understanding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine. Several of his albums received certification of silver or gold. He received two lifetime...

Answer the question...the keiretsu tradition in japan serves as a??","output":"The Keiretsu tradition in Japan serves as a significant organizational structure and a unique approach to managing business relations within the Japanese economy. Keiretsu refers to a network of closely related, interdependent companies that have strong, long-term ties with each other. The various businesses within this network hold minority shares in each other's companies, and they pursue mutual cooperation by engaging in joint ventures, sharing technology, and aligning their operations to create synergies. This results in an integrated and resilient system that fosters stability, loyalty, and mutual support. As a unique business model, the Keiretsu tradition serves several essential purposes in Japan: 1. Economic Stability: Keiretsu structure emphasizes long-term relationships and commitments, leading to a more stable economic environment. The businesses within a Keiretsu tend to collaborate instead of competing, making it possible for them to pool their resources, create economies of scale, and reduce the risk of market disruptions and hostile takeovers. 2. Risk Diversification: The horizontal nature of Keiretsu allows the companies to spread their risks across various industries and sectors, which may result in higher financial resiliency. This diversification enables companies to withstand economic downturns and mitigate losses if a particular industry or company underperforms. 3. Expansion of Resources and Capabilities: The tight-knit network among Keiretsu companies enables them to share information, technology, and resources with ease. This cooperative approach can lead to accelerated innovation and the development of new products and services, thereby providing a competitive advantage to the companies within the Keiretsu. 4. Access to Capital: The interlocking of share ownership allows Keiretsu companies to source capital from their business partners. This provides an alternative to traditional bank loans, reduces the pressure for short-term financial performance, and allows businesses to focus on long-term growth and development. 5. Talent Development and Retention: Keiretsu tradition fosters strong relationships not only between the companies but also among employees, who benefit from extensive training and development programs. The stability of career paths within Keiretsu companies may result in higher retention rates, lower turnover, and a stronger workforce. 6. Flexibility and Adaptability: Although Keiretsu may appear rigid in nature, this business model allows participating companies to adapt quickly to market changes and develop new strategies. They can do so by leveraging the expertise, resources, and collaborative relationships within the Keiretsu network. 7. Trust and Loyalty: A significant advantage of the Keiretsu tradition in Japan is the high-degree of trust and loyalty developed over time within the network of companies. This trust keeps the businesses interconnected and promotes cooperation during challenging economic times. In conclusion, the Keiretsu tradition in Japan serves as a vital organizational structure that supports stability, diversification, resource sharing, access to capital, talent development and retention, adaptability, and the formation of trust and loyalty among participating businesses. Rocked by Japan's post-WWII economic challenges, the Keiretsu system has played an essential role in transforming the Japanese economy into a robust, cohesive force that has emerged as a global standard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"oklahoma 's dead reckoning\\" Text:","output":"Title: Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning: A Journey Through the Heartland's Dark Heritage Introduction Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning delves into the hidden chapters of the state's dark heritage, exploring a mosaic of untold tales, unsolved mysteries, and forgotten tragedies that lie beneath its rolling prairies, tranquil plains, and fervent zeal for progress. A dead reckoning, in the parlance of navigators, is an estimate of one's position based on previously known data, with limited scope for perception or foresight. In a similar vein, this account takes the reader on a journey through Oklahoma's intricate past, attempting to reassemble its sinister fragments in order to trace the indelible marks left on the cultural fabric of the state and its people. Chapter 1: Puritans and the Promised Land The first chapter narrates the grim antecedents of European settlers who arrived in Oklahoma, fleeing persecution and seeking religious freedom. Their zealousness to establish a veritable Promised Land often led to the brutal displacement of native populations and the demonization of indigenous spiritual practices, setting the stage for a troubled history of conflict, polarization, and resistance. Chapter 2: The Shadow of Slavery and the Trail of Tears Oklahoma's connection to the institution of slavery is multilayered and complex, intertwining the fates of Native American tribes, African slaves, and White Americans. This chapter examines the forced relocation of the Five Civilized Tribes—including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole—who held slaves and were expelled from their ancestral lands in the southeastern United States, leaving behind a legacy of suffering, exploitation, and betrayal known as the Trail of Tears. Chapter 3: The Great Land Run and the Dawn of a New Era Like a modern-day reenactment of Exodus, thousands of hopeful settlers raced across the Oklahoma Territory in 1889, eager to stake their claim in what many believed to be the land of opportunity. This chapter presents a vivid portrayal of the Oklahoma Land Run, a tumultuous time of land grabbing, fraud, and bitter disputes that transformed the landscape and forced native inhabitants into further obfuscation and disadvantage. Chapter 4: Dark Tales of the Dust Bowl The 1930s saw Oklahoma's abundant farmland turn into a barren wasteland, as the state became the epicenter of the Dust Bowl, a devastating environmental disaster that brought death, despair, and poverty to thousands. Amidst the choking dust storms and swirling sands, the state bore witness to an astronomical rise in crime, dislocation, and social tensions that changed the course of its future. Chapter 5: Legends of Outlaws and Lawmen Oklahoma has a storied history of outlaws, bandits, and desperadoes that prowled the frontier, leaving a trail of blood, plunder, and legend in their wake. This chapter takes the reader on a thrilling ride through the lives of infamous personalities like Belle Starr, Bill Doolin, and the Dalton Gang, as well as the lawmen who dared to challenge their nefarious exploits. Chapter 6: Oklahoma City Bombing: A Day of Infamy On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, claiming the lives of 168 people and forever altering the city's landscape. This chapter delves into the motives, planning, and impact of the worst act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, exposing a darker undercurrent of extremism, distrust, and disillusionment festering within the heartland. Conclusion Oklahoma's Dead Reckoning serves as a stark reminder that history is seldom a linear progression, and that even the most picturesque landscapes and pastoral settings can conceal darker truths. While the state has made significant strides in healing old wounds, embracing diversity, and moving towards a brighter future, it is crucial to bear in mind the sobering lessons of the past, lest they be swept away by the ever-present winds of change. At its core, the book serves as an ode to human resilience, and to the indomitable spirit of those who call Oklahoma their home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key information in both sentences. Sentence 1: different man, stood before them Sentence 2: not recognize, man standing before them Step 2: Analyze the meaning of both sentences. Sentence 1 suggests that the man standing before them may have changed his behavior or appearance. Sentence 2 states that the people were unable to recognize the man standing before them. Step 3: Compare the sentences to determine if the first sentence being true means the second sentence is true. If it was a different man who stood before them (Sentence 1), it is possible that they could not recognize him due to the change or difference (Sentence 2). However, not recognizing the man is not the only possible outcome from Sentence 1; they could possibly still recognize the man, despite the differences. Result: If the first sentence is true, the second sentence could be true, but it is not guaranteed to be true. There are other possible outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is sale used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? I got some great bargains at their annual sale. They held a sale to reduce their inventory.","output":"To determine if \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same thing in these two sentences, let's analyze them step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the meaning of \\"sale\\" in each sentence. 1. In the first sentence, \\"I got some great bargains at their annual sale,\\" the word \\"sale\\" refers to a special event in which items are discounted, allowing the customer to buy them at lower prices than usual. 2. In the second sentence, \\"They held a sale to reduce their inventory,\\" the word \\"sale\\" refers to an event organized by the seller to sell items at discounted prices in order to decrease their stock or inventory. Step 2: Compare the meanings identified in both sentences. In both sentences, \\"sale\\" refers to a special event where items are being sold at discounted prices. However, the focus is slightly different: 1. In the first sentence, the emphasis is on the positive outcome for the customer (i.e., getting great bargains). 2. In the second sentence, the emphasis is on the purpose from the seller's perspective (i.e., reducing their inventory). Step 3: Determine if \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same thing in both sentences. After comparing the meanings in both sentences, we can conclude that \\"sale\\" is used to mean the same fundamental concept: a special event with discounted items. The slight difference in focus (customer's perspective vs. seller's perspective) does not change the core meaning of the term \\"sale\\" in each sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Manuel Carlos Prado y Ugarteche was a Peruvian banker and political figure, born in Lima on April 21, 1889, and passed away on August 15, 1967. He was the son of former Peruvian president Mariano Ignacio Prado and had a brother named Leoncio Prado Gutiérrez, who was a military hero.  Prado served as the President of Peru twice, first from 1939 to 1945 and then again from 1956 to 1962. As a young army officer, he played a key role in the coup that overthrew Peruvian President Guillermo Billinghurst in 1914. In 1934, he became the president of the Central Reserve Bank. Manuel Prado was a conservative patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family, and reached the presidency of Peru with the help of the left-wing Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA) party. Upon taking office, Prado announced that he would declare a general political amnesty and put an end to the proscription of political parties.  During Prado's second presidency (1956-1962), the only significant proscribed party was the APRA, which was thrown out of power and outlawed in 1948 by President Manuel Odría. Prado promised to submit a bill to the newly elected congress to legalize the APRA once again. The bill was eventually passed, and the APRA's founder, Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, returned from foreign exile.  In terms of foreign policy, Prado was known for making Peru the first South American nation to break off relations with the Axis powers in 1942 during his first presidency. He was expected to side firmly with the United States in foreign policy matters. In summary, key details about Manuel Prado Ugarteche include his role as a Peruvian banker and political figure, having served as the president of Peru twice and the president of the Central Reserve Bank, his involvement in the coup that overthrew President Billinghurst, his association with the APRA party, and his foreign policy stance, particularly related to the Axis powers and the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pirates and Reds Renew a Rivalry The teams traded National League pennants at the start of the 1960s and again at the dawn of the â70s, when they both won two titles. Neither team reached the playoffs in the 1980s, but both started the â90s as division champions. They fell on hard times in the early 2000s, despite moving from multipurpose bowls to charming little ballparks along riverbanks. Joe Morgan played his last Reds playoff game in Pittsburgh. Roberto Clemente played the last game of his life in the playoffs in Cincinnati. The teams matched up four times in the N.L.C.S. in the 1970s, and again in 1990. âThe rivalryâs been very, very good over the years, simply because of the similarities of the cities,â said Jay Bell, the Piratesâ hitting coach and their former shortstop. âThereâs a Midwest type of atmosphere in both cities, and the personalities of the fans are very similar. Theyâre passionate about their teams.â Bell still remembers the final inning of the 1990 series, with the Reds leading by a run in Game 6 in Cincinnati. With one out and a man on, the Piratesâ Carmelo Martinez drove a ball to deep right field. Over the fence, and the Pirates would be three outs away from forcing a seventh game. âCarmelo knocked the snot out of it,â Bell said. âItâs a home run. But they were playing no-doubles, and Glenn Braggs reached up over the fence and caught it.â The series ended one batter later, and the Reds went on to sweep Oakland in the World Series. The Pirates went on to lose seven-game heartbreakers to Atlanta in 1991 and 1992, precipitating two decades of losing seasons. The Reds have not won a postseason series in 18 years, but no team has suffered quite like the Pirates. The Reds, who have lost two division series in three years, cannot match the Pirates for sustained suffering. A Market Square rally Monday was just part of a citywide baseball catharsis. âFor many of us out there, this organization was a crown jewel in your adolescence, when you were growing up â and then there was a famine,â Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle said. âAs I shared with the people today, the heart is the most wonderful muscle that God has put in our body, and weâve twisted yours for 21 years. But to show the strength of it, what are you feeling today?â The pride in this city should be evident Tuesday, with players encouraging fans to wear black, to match the teamâs jersey. The Pirates will start the left-hander Francisco Liriano, who went 16-8 with a 3.02 earned run average after signing for a guarantee of only 1 million. His success put into effect a guaranteed contract with the Pirates for next season. âIn the past, when people came here, it was more of a rehabilitation center,â said Andrew McCutchen, the homegrown center fielder who will probably be named the N.L.âs most valuable player. âItâs true â guys came here at the end of their careers, thinking they were going to boost their game, have a good year and go somewhere else. Now, people come here because they want to be here. They want to be a part of a team that can change things, part of a team that can win.â The Pirates, whose home park favors pitchers, scored the fewest runs of any playoff team this season (3.91 a game). But they fortified their lineup in late August by trading for right fielder Marlon Byrd, who hit .318 after a trade from the Mets, and first baseman Justin Morneau, who hit .260 after coming over from Minnesota. Byrd is 7 for 12 with a home run in his career against the Redsâ Johnny Cueto, who will start on Tuesday. Then again, Cueto has dazzled in his career at PNC Park, with a 1.90 earned run average in 13 starts, mostly against inferior Pirates lineups. More important than the statistics will be Cuetoâs health. He has started only twice since late June and made three trips to the disabled list this season with back problems. Cueto, who pitches with an exaggerated back twist, was forced from his playoff start in San Francisco last October after one batter because of back spasms. The Reds lost the series in five games. âLast year, we were positioned pretty good,â Manager Dusty Baker said. âThe only problem we had last year is we didnât have Johnny Cueto.â The Reds would have hosted this game if they had taken a series from the Pirates last weekend in Cincinnati. Instead, they lost three in a row, after falling twice to the Mets. They finished the regular season on a five-game losing streak, scoring only eight runs. âThereâs only 10 of us left standing, and weâre proud to be one of the 10, no matter how you got there,â Baker said, referring to the playoff field. âThey say you back in, you limp in. It donât matter how you got there, just get there.â The surroundings are familiar for the Reds, but the charged atmosphere is unlikely to be their biggest impediment to a division-series date with the St. Louis Cardinals. Liriano is much more imposing. In his career, he has handcuffed some of the Redsâ best hitters, including Shin-Soo Choo (6 for 31), Jay Bruce (0 for 11) and Joey Votto (2 for 10). For all of the teamsâ shared history, the game will not come down to black T-shirts or Jolly Roger flags or the longing of a proud and loyal fan base. Even Hurdle, who leads the cheers, concedes that. âThe beauty of it is, once the game starts, youâve got a game again,â he said. âOur guys are looking forward to the opportunity.â Summary:","output":"The Pirates and Reds baseball teams have a long history and rivalry. They both had good times in the 1960s and 1970s when they won some championships, but they both had some bad times too. The fans in both cities love their teams a lot and are very excited when they play each other. The players and coaches remember many close games and special moments from their past games. Now, the teams are getting ready to play against each other again, and everyone is excited to see what will happen."},{"instruction":"Q:The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

Monetarists believed that by controlling the growth of the money supply, they could maintain low inflation and stable economic growth. Their primary tools for controlling the money supply were interest rates and open market operations. By adjusting interest rates and buying or selling government securities, central banks could influence the amount of money in circulation and, therefore, control economic activity.

In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. What do museums think about Chihuly's works becoming part of their exhibits? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. they probably wouldn't be interested  B. they may or may not have interest  C. not enough information  D. they probably would be thrilled","output":"D. They probably would be thrilled. Museums would most likely be thrilled to have Dale Chihuly's works become part of their exhibits. His ingenious artistry, talent, and unique vision have been recognized all around the world, granting him numerous awards and accolades. Chihuly's creations are included in over 200 museum collections worldwide, signifying his global reputation as a master glass artist. Having Chihuly's work in their exhibits not only adds cultural prestige to the museums but also works as a substantial draw for art enthusiasts, growing their visitor numbers. The combination of Chihuly's dedication to pushing the boundaries of his craft and the broad appeal of his intricate glass installations make his works highly attractive to museums. They would relish the opportunity to include his exceptional art pieces in their collection. Over the years, Chihuly has exhibited his works in numerous museums such as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where they organized the Chihuly at the V&A exhibition in 2001, and the Tower of David Museum in Jerusalem. His artwork has been displayed and admired by millions of people through various exhibitions, solidifying his position as a highly sought-after artist. In conclusion, museums would likely be thrilled to have Dale Chihuly's works as part of their exhibits due to his outstanding reputation, innovative approach to glass art, and the ability of his striking creations to attract and captivate a wide audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the equation 475*q - 7832 + 29222 = -524*q + 286*q for q, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with the q variable on both sides of the equation.  On the left side of the equation, there are no terms to combine. On the right side, we have two terms that contain q: -524*q and 286*q. Combine these terms: -524*q + 286*q = (-524 + 286)*q = -238*q So, the updated equation is: 475*q - 7832 + 29222 = -238*q Step 2: Move all q terms to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To move the -238*q term to the left side of the equation, we need to add the 238*q so that it cancels out: 475*q + 238*q - 7832 + 29222 = 0 Next, add the constant terms, -7832 and 29222: 713*q + 21390 = 0 Step 3: Isolate the q variable. To isolate q, subtract 21390 from both sides of the equation: 713*q = -21390 Now, divide both sides by 713: q = -21390 / 713 Step 4: Simplify the result to find the value of q. q ≈ -30 So, the answer is q ≈ -30."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At the end , Princess Minnie entitles Mickey , Donald and Goofy Royal Musketeers . Options are:  + no.  + yes.","output":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning, though with slight differences in the choice of words. In both sentences, the context is set towards \\"the end,\\" indicating that this event takes place at the conclusion of a story or journey. The main character, Princess Minnie, takes action to honor three other characters – Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. In the first sentence, the verb \\"dubs\\" is utilized. To dub someone means to honor or confer a title, name, or nickname upon an individual. In this case, Princess Minnie dubs Mickey, Donald, and Goofy \\"royal musketeers.\\" This signifies that she is bestowing this prestigious title upon them, perhaps in recognition of their accomplishments or as a means of inducting them into a group of esteemed warriors or protectors. The second sentence employs the verb \\"entitles.\\" In this context, to entitle someone means to give them an official title, designation, or right. Consequently, the act of entitling Mickey, Donald, and Goofy \\"Royal Musketeers\\" suggests that Princess Minnie is formally awarding these characters a distinguished title, possibly as a reward for their achievements or as an acknowledgment of their membership in an elite force. While both statements convey slightly different nuances, they essentially share the same gist: Princess Minnie is honoring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy by bestowing the title of \\"Royal Musketeers\\" upon them at the end.

The judge suggested that the farmer ought to find a wife before the ban comes into effect. This intriguing story unfolds in the rural reaches of County Kerry, where a seemingly ordinary court hearing took a unique twist. Step 1: Discuss the details of the court hearing At the recent court hearing, the bachelor farmer, who hails from an isolated part of County Kerry, was facing charges for drink-driving. The judge assigned to the case chose to impart some wisdom upon the defendant before passing the judgement. In an unorthodox move, the judge encouraged the single man to find a life partner before the driving ban is implemented. He believed that having a significant other would positively impact the farmer's life and possibly save him from further drink-driving incidents in the future. Step 2: Evaluate the circumstances faced by the bachelor farmer The suggestion came at a time when the bachelor farmer was feeling the strain of his isolation. With no family around, the burden of managing his farm and daily chores were taking a toll on his wellbeing. Added to this was the looming drink-driving ban, which would restrict his mobility and prevent him from attending social events, further exacerbating his feelings of loneliness and isolation. Step 3: Discuss possible reasons for the judge's unusual advice It may appear that the judge's advice stemmed from his concern for the farmer's overall wellbeing. Recognizing the bachelor's difficult circumstances, the judge might have believed that finding companionship could alleviate his sense of isolation, ultimately resulting in reduced instances of drink-driving. Moreover, having a spouse who could potentially share the responsibilities of farm work and daily tasks might lessen the man's stress and ensure a more balanced lifestyle. Step 4: Explore the societal pressures and issues faced by rural communities The bachelor farmer's situation can be seen as a reflection of the challenges faced by many inhabitants of rural communities. The pressures of isolation, a lack of social connections, and the demands of farm life can take a substantial toll on mental health and overall wellbeing. In such cases, measures to combat loneliness and promote human interaction are essential for maintaining life balance and preventing dangerous behaviors like drink-driving. Step 5: Conclusion and a look towards the future In conclusion, the judge's unorthodox advice for a bachelor farmer from an isolated part of County Kerry has shone a light on the struggles faced by many rural dwellers. While it is uncertain whether the farmer will take the judge's counsel to heart, this unusual court ruling raises essential questions about the mental wellbeing of those living in rural communities and the importance of companionship in ensuring a balanced life.

Fine art treasures from many countries are kept in an art museum called the Louvre   in Paris, France. The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum. It is a place where art treasures are kept for everyone to enjoy. Every year millions of people from all over the world come to the Louvre to see the masterpieces.

How do you do this: To reheat pasta in the microwave without ruining the texture,","output":"To reheat pasta in the microwave without ruining the texture, follow these simple steps: 1. Put the pasta in a microwave-safe container: Find a container that's safe for the microwave. It should be big enough to hold the pasta. Remember to always use a microwave-safe container. 2. Add a little water: Pour a small amount of water into the container with the pasta. It will help create steam, which will keep the pasta from getting too dry or hard. 3. Cover the container: Use a microwave-safe lid, or even a microwave-safe plate, to cover the container. This helps to keep the steam inside, so the pasta stays soft and moist. 4. Microwave on low power: Set your microwave to a low power setting, like 50% or lower. This will help the pasta heat up slowly and evenly, which is important for keeping the texture nice. 5. Stir the pasta: After about 1 minute of heating, stop the microwave and carefully remove the lid. Be careful, as steam can be hot! Then, stir the pasta so that it heats up more evenly. Put the lid back on and continue heating. 6. Check the pasta: After another 1 to 2 minutes, take the pasta out of the microwave and check if it's heated through. Be careful when removing the lid, as steam can be hot! If it's not warm enough, give it another stir and heat it for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, until it's just right. And that's it! Your pasta should be nice and warm, without getting dry, hard, or soggy. Enjoy!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Let's dissect the sentence and examine the reasons why it can be deemed correct: 1. Morphology: Morphology is the study of the formation and structure of words in a language. In the given sentence, each word has a clear and appropriate structure. \\"The\\" is a definite article, which specifies a particular noun that follows. \\"Man\\" is a common noun that denotes a person, specifically an adult male. \\"Went\\" is the simple past tense of the verb \\"to go,\\" showing an action that took place in the past. \\"To\\" is a preposition that indicates direction, and \\"store\\" is a common noun representing a place where goods are sold. 2. Syntax: Syntax is the study of the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. In English, the standard word order is subject-verb-object (SVO). In our sentence, \\"The man\\" is the subject, \\"went\\" is the verb, and \\"to the store\\" is the object. The sentence follows the SVO order, making it syntactically correct. Moreover, all the necessary elements are in the sentence: a subject (the man), a predicate (went), and a complement that provides more information about the action (to the store). 3. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language. In the given sentence, all words are clear in their meaning and together, they create a coherent statement, which is easily understood. The sentence uses proper grammar and conventional language, and its meaning is unambiguous – an adult male performed the action of going to a store in the past.

Article: A team of engineers at Apple couldn't extract information from an iPhone belonging to one of the two teens who went missing last summer, but one of the families is still pushing for further testing.      Austin Stephanos' cell phone was retrieved from the capsized boat he and his friend Perry Cohen, both 14, had taken on a fishing trip off the Jupiter Inlet when they disappeared last July 24.      The phone was discovered in March when a Norwegian supply ship found the boys' capsized 19-foot SeaCraft off the coast of Bermuda. The phone, which was still on the boat, was then handed over the Stephanos' family.      Blu Stephanos, Austin's father, said in a statement that he received a call Tuesday night from his attorney, Michael Pike, who told him the phone couldn't be restored by Apple engineers.      Pike said he spoke to Apple representatives Tuesday and his client is \\"devastated.      \\"It's just a tragic, devastating situation,\\" Pike said. \\"I know the families are very disappointed relative to the outcome of not being able to power on the phone.\\"      In a statement, Perry Cohen's mother Pamela said that according to Apple, there were other experts who may be able to extract data from the phone. She said the company offered to hand over the phone to experts if the families can come to an agreement.      \\"As I said before, I owe it to Perry to exhaust every possible avenue in pursuit of finding out what happened to him,\\" Pamela Cohen said. \\"We look forward to working cooperatively with Austin's family toward this transition. We are not giving up on the iPhone's potential for evidence until all viable efforts have been exhausted.\\"      An extensive search by the U.S. Coast Guard, law enforcement agencies, private groups and others couldn't locate the pair.      The boat was initially found by the U.S Coast Guard off the coast of Daytona Beach two days after they disappeared, but drifted away because it wasn't secured.      On March 18, the Edda Fjord, a Norwegian supply vessel, came across the boys' boat off the coast of Bermuda.      The discovery of the phone sparked a brief legal dispute, with the Cohen family filing a lawsuit against the Stephanos family and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The Cohen family wanted the phone to be examined to determine whether any information on it could shed light on where the boys were before disappearing.      The families agreed to send the phone over to Apple to see whether any data could be retrieved from it.      Apple had to take the phone apart \\"in order to run the diagnostics, clean and restore components and perform a chemical workup\\" in an effort to analyze the data, according to Blu Stephanos' statement.      \\"One of the problems that we seem to have run into is even if the phone was able to be powered on, it is running the 8.4 iOS [operating system] software, which is very challenging, if not impossible to break the access code/password,\\" Pike said.      Stephanos said he was told Apple had a team that worked \\"around the clock\\" on his son's phone. He thanked the company for trying to assist his family.      \\"Needless to say, we were disappointed, having hoped to get some information or maybe just some final memories from Austin's phone,\\" he said in the statement. \\"But the fact that it can no longer function doesn't diminish its value as a cherished memory of my beloved son.\\"      Apple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment.      Stephanos added that now the phone has been deemed unusable, he hopes the family can grieve in private.      kjacobson@sunsentinel.com, 561-243-6547 or Twitter @katejacobson ||||| But the phone — which did not have a case and could have spent eight months waterlogged in the capsized boat — was not salvageable, said Austin’s father, Blu Stephanos. He said he got the crushing news from his attorney on Tuesday night after speaking with Apple.      \\"Unfortunately, Austin’s iPhone could not be restored to working order,\\" Stephanos said in a statement. \\"They also told him that the phone is currently in several pieces, since testing required them to disassemble it in order to run the diagnostics, clean and restore components and perform a chemical workup.\\"      Related: Families Cling to Hope That iPhone Holds Clues to Florida Teens Lost at Sea      The phone belonged to Austin but was also used by Perry — which led Perry’s family to challenge Stephanos in court to ensure the device was being properly preserved. Ultimately, the families agreed to have Apple handle it.      \\"It’s our understanding that Apple had a team assigned to the iPhone around the clock, and for that we are truly grateful,\\" Stephanos said.      Stephanos added that the family is disappointed that the phone, which was found in a compartment on the boat, could not be revived. They lost call logs, text messages, pictures and other information that could have led to clues to help find the boys, who are officially classified as missing.      Fourteen-year-olds Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos are seen in this handout provided by the United States Coast Guard in Miami on July 26, 2015.      The phone was found in the teens' 18-foot, single-engine Seacraft vessel, which was discovered in March by a Norwegian supply ship about 100 miles off the coast of Bermuda. The body of the two teens — experienced boaters — were not found.      The pair had set out on a fishing trip on July 24 from the Jupiter Inlet, just north of West Palm Beach, as severe weather approached.      Their disappearance led some family members to suggest the possibility of foul play.      Related: Foul Play Possible in Florida Teens' Disappearance at Sea      Perry's stepfather, Nick Korniloff, had contacted the FBI and the state to voice his concern that the boys may have been abducted, according to a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission report.

(AP) — The parents of two teen fishermen who disappeared in a storm off Florida clashed again Wednesday after Apple said it could not retrieve any data from an iPhone discovered in the wreckage of their boat eight months after they capsized.      Blu Stephanos announced Wednesday that the iPhone belonging to his son Austin was too damaged to be fixed. Pamela Cohen, whose son Perry also vanished, doesn't want to give up yet.      Austin and his friend Perry Cohen, both 14, disappeared last July after their 19-foot boat overturned during a storm off the coast of Jupiter, Florida. A massive sea and air search never found their bodies, but a Norwegian cargo ship picked up their boat near Bermuda in March. Austin's phone was found on board, and the families hoped it would provide clues to what happened.      Other remnants of their lives are on their way home: The boat and recovered fishing gear are scheduled to arrive back in Florida on Monday aboard a cargo ship.      Meanwhile, Stephanos said in a statement that he will keep the phone as a memento of his son.      \\"The fact that it can no longer function as a phone doesn't diminish its value as a cherished memory of my beloved son,\\" he wrote. \\"It's a small piece of him; something he used to call me at night when he needed to talk to someone, something he put his stickers on and carried with him every day. As any parent would understand, to me, it's not a broken phone, but a memory of my son that I will hold close to my heart and treasure for the rest of my life.\\"      Perry's mother, Pamela Cohen, issued her own statement, saying she wants to work with the other boy's family to have the phone examined by more experts.      \\"I owe it to Perry to exhaust every possible avenue in pursuit of finding out what happened to him,\\" wrote Cohen, who took Stephanos to court last month when he balked at having Apple examine the phone.      \\"According to Apple, there are other experts in the field who may be able to pick up where Apple left off, to continue the work,\\" she wrote. \\"We are not giving up on the iPhone's potential for evidence until all viable efforts have been exhausted.\\"      Austin and Perry were close friends, but rifts have appeared between their families since they disappeared. Last October, Pamela Cohen asked the other boy's parents not to use her son's name and likeness while fundraising for their new foundation.

I care about his general well-being, but he pushed me out of his life, so I don't feel like it's my responsibility anymore to make sure he is okay. Am I being selfish? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The two questions you've asked are quite different in nature and do not hold the same meaning, but they both revolve around the theme of experiencing and expressing complicated emotions in difficult situations. 1. \\"I hate my dad, should I feel bad if he loses his job?\\" In this question, you're expressing a negative emotion (hatred) towards your father, and you are wondering whether, despite this emotion, you should feel sympathy or concern for him if he were to lose his job. This is a complicated emotional situation, as it is possible to have negative feelings towards someone and still empathize with their struggles. It is essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid - if you have a difficult relationship with your father, your emotions are justified. However, feeling bad for someone who is going through a tough time doesn't necessarily mean you need to forgive them or forget about your feelings. In this situation, it might be helpful to reflect on the reasons behind your negative emotions towards your father and consider if those reasons warrant you not feeling any sympathy for him. It is also important to remember the significance of empathy in such cases. Empathy means putting yourself in someone else's shoes and trying to understand their emotions and actions better. You might still dislike your father, but acknowledging the challenging time he may be going through if he loses his job can be beneficial for your growth and understanding of the situation. 2. \\"Should I contact my ex about losing his job?\\" In this question, you are concerned about whether or not to reach out to an ex-partner after learning of their job loss. You mention that multiple people have suggested you check on him, but you feel it is not your responsibility anymore, as your ex-partner pushed you out of their life. This situation is also emotionally complex. You are caught between caring for your ex's well-being and maintaining the boundaries that occurred as a result of your separation. It's normal to feel conflicted in such situations, and it's important to consider your own feelings and mental well-being when deciding whether or not to contact your ex. You mentioned that your ex-partner pushed you out of their life, which might indicate that reaching out to them may not be well-received or positively impact your emotional state. Setting healthy boundaries in relationships, even past relationships, is necessary, and it's important to respect and nurture your well-being. Evaluate your reasons for wanting to reach out and consider potential outcomes of the interaction. Remember that it is not selfish to prioritize your mental health and emotional well-being. In conclusion, these two questions do not have the same meaning but are both centered around navigating complicated emotions in challenging situations. It's essential to prioritize your well-being, acknowledge your emotions, and practice empathy when navigating these scenarios. Reflect on the reasons behind your emotions, seek to understand, and then choose the most appropriate action based on your personal growth and the possible outcomes of your decisions."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

How does the sentence end? See options at the end Robert was very stubborn but Matthew always was willing to compromise, so  Choose your answer from: - Robert refused to accept advice.; - Matthew refused to accept advice.;","output":"Robert was very stubborn but Matthew always was willing to compromise, so Robert refused to accept advice.  The sentence implies a comparison between two characters, Robert and Matthew, with distinct personality traits. Here, we learn that Robert is a stubborn person, a characteristic usually associated with inflexibility, rigidity, and an unwillingness to change one's mind or accept advice. On the other hand, Matthew is depicted as a compromising individual, which suggests a predisposition towards flexibility, open-mindedness, and willingness to meet others halfway.  Given these descriptions, which establish a clear contrast in their behavioral patterns and their predilections to act in specific ways, it is more logical and consistent with their characterized traits to state that \\"Robert refused to accept advice.\\" His stubbornness and obstinacy would be consistent with a refusal to accept advice, as it corroborates the characterization of him having a closed mind and an unyielding attitude.  Meanwhile, the portrayal of Matthew as a compromising person would be inconsistent with the assertion that he's the one who refused to accept advice. This action contradicts the essential attribute attributed to Matthew - that of being open to negotiations and changes of plans. Compromisers tend to be good listeners who value the input and advice of others as they seek a satisfactory resolution for all parties involved.  Therefore, given the behavioral traits of Robert and Matthew, as depicted in the sentence, it is accurate to resolve the sentence by saying, \\"Robert refused to accept advice.\\" Consequently, this statement is reflective of his stubborn, inflexible character that aligns with a closed-minded approach to external input."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: In the courtyard of Teatro Lux, a theater in Pisa, Italy, the performance of an experimental production on Saturday offered an unusual spectacle. The play, called “Mirages,” was not performed from a stage, but throughout the theater by different actors in different places. The audience moved through the play as one might move through a gallery. Then, the surreal scene got even more so: An actor performing a monologue in which he simulated hanging, either accidentally or purposefully, hung himself for real in front of a single member of the audience. Now, 27-year-old Raphael Schumacher is dead, and two directors and two stage technicians are being investigated for manslaughter, as ANSA News reported. “The actor was supposed to perform a short monologue, revolving around the difficulties experienced by a 15-year-old boy and including a hanging simulation at the end,” prosecutor Giancarlo Dominijanni told Il Tirreno. “The original script included an interaction between the spectator and Schumacher before the tragic event. It was performed successfully earlier on Saturday evening, when he ended the scene laying his head in the noose.” Schumacher, as the BBC reported, was rescued by the audience member, who happened to be a recently graduated from medical school and who, though Schumacher’s face was covered, saw his body twitching. But the damage was irreversible. He never recovered consciousness and was declared clinically dead Thursday. Questions about how he could have met such a tragic fate — and speculation over whether he meant to kill himself — have been raised as details of the strange incident slowly emerged in Italian media and English-language outlets. “I strongly believe he did not try to commit suicide,” the actor’s mother, unnamed in an Il Tirreno report, said. “… His father died recently and he had just broken up with someone, but he had soon regained inner peace. He didn’t leave any messages and had no reason to kill himself.” However, others pointed out that Schumacher had changed the original ending of his scene in “Mirages.” “The script included a different ending, a gunshot. Raphael changed it without telling us,” Andrea Vescio, one of the managers of Teatro Lux, said. Vescio added: “All I can say is that I saw a 27-year-old boy on the ground, unconscious. He was performing a hanging scene in front of a sole spectator, the young graduate who called for help.” (The ANSA report that confirmed Schumacher’s death did not name the theater staff under investigation.) “We are truly shocked,” Gabriele De Luca, art director of the theater, told Il Tirreno. “We don’t know what happened exactly, nobody knows. We immediately started collaborating with the investigators. … We just hope Raphael will get better soon.” In the wake of the tragedy, the theater has closed. “Following the imponderable tragedy that occurred at the Theater Lux in the night of Saturday 30 January, we believe it is appropriate to suspend all activities of the theater, including the shows,” the theater said in a statement translated to English on its Facebook page. “As soon as the activities will resume it will be our care to communicate through our website, our profiles on social networks and the media, the press. We will of course to reimburse as soon as possible all those who had already bought tickets. Some of your understanding we hope you can respect this silence, we salute you.” Schumacher graduated from drama school last year; Teatro Lux is a venue in downtown Pisa that includes a movie theater, bar and performance space. An English translation of a mission statement posted to its website reads: “We want to dispel the myth … that theater is something boring and challenging, suitable only for young ladies in fur coats and tails, and rediscover the playful and popular — in the best sense of the term — soul of the theater.” Wife crashes her own funeral, horrifying her husband, who had paid to have her killed Justin Wm.

Answer this question: the place where the peasants struggled against the indigo plantation system??","output":"The place where the peasants struggled against the indigo plantation system was the Bengal region of British India, which is now divided into the Indian state of West Bengal and the independent country of Bangladesh. The indigo plantation system was introduced by the British in the 18th and 19th centuries as a means to exploit the fertile lands of Bengal for the production of indigo, a natural blue dye that was in high demand in Europe. The indigo plant (indigofera plant) required specific climatic and soil conditions to grow, which made the Bengal region a suitable place for its cultivation. The British colonizers imposed the indigo plantation system on the local peasants to maximize their profits. They set up oppressive contracts with the peasants, forcing them to cultivate indigo on their land instead of traditional crops like paddy or jute. The British planters paid very low prices for the indigo crops and often manipulated accounts to keep the peasants indebted, which in turn forced the peasants to continue producing indigo. The exploitation and injustice in the indigo plantation system led to widespread poverty, hunger, and misery among the peasants. The conditions became unbearable and eventually sparked a peasant uprising known as the Indigo Rebellion or Nil Bidroho (also called the Blue Mutiny) in 1859-60. The Indigo Rebellion was concentrated in the Nadia, Murshidabad, Jessore, and Faridpur districts in the Bengal region. Peasants organized themselves and resisted the indigo planters to fight against the unjust practices. With the support of native intelligentsia, the rebellion gained momentum, and the peasants refused to sow indigo seeds or pay the unjust debts. One key figure who played a significant role in the struggle against the indigo plantation system was Dinabandhu Mitra, a Bengali playwright, and a leader of the Indigo Rebellion. His famous play 'Neel Darpan' (The Mirror of Indigo) depicted the oppressions faced by the indigo cultivators and exposed the exploitative British planters. The play became a potent symbol of the revolt and fueled more resistance against the plantation system. Within a few years of the rebellion, the British authorities recognized the gravity of the situation, and in 1861 the government enacted the Indigo Commission. This commission was tasked with investigating the grievances of the indigo cultivators, and its findings led to the implementation of policy changes that reduced the exploitation of peasants. The indigo planters were instructed to discontinue the forceful cultivation of indigo, and peasants were allowed to break their contracts without repercussions. Due to these changes, the indigo plantation system gradually declined in Bengal, and the peasants were able to return to cultivating their traditional crops. The struggle of the Bengal peasants against the indigo plantation system serves as a powerful example of resistance against colonial exploitation and marked an important phase in the long journey towards Indian independence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Among these issues were the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, war, and terrorism – each explored through different movies. Schindler's List, in particular, addresses the Holocaust, which was the state-sponsored genocide of millions of innocent people, including six million Jews, perpetrated by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II. Schindler's List is a poignant film that tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist and a member of the Nazi party, who eventually becomes an unlikely hero by saving the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. The film depicts the inhumane treatment and persecution that Jews experienced during these dark times and highlights themes like grief, guilt, resilience, and hope for humanity. Spielberg's portrayal of the Holocaust helps to remind audiences of a gruesome era in history, encouraging them to confront and discuss the atrocities that occurred during the Holocaust. Furthermore, the sentence also notes other important films directed by Spielberg and the respective humanistic issues they address. For instance, Amistad discusses the transatlantic slave trade, while multiple movies like Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, War Horse, and Bridge of Spies are based on different aspects of war. Munich, on the other hand, takes on the subject of terrorism. Overall, the sentence answers the question by pointing out the issue Spielberg explored in Schindler's List – the Holocaust. Simultaneously, it gives an overview of other humanistic issues explored by Spielberg in his later films, showcasing the breadth and depth of his work as a director."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It would mean that a the price of bottle of wine, would rise by 10p. Pints of low-strength beer would go up by 2p and continental lager by 3p. Proposal put forward by right-wing think tank Centre for Social Justice. Article:","output":"Title: Innovative Rehab Funding: A 1p Surcharge per Alcohol Unit to Offer Help to Alcoholics The Centre for Social Justice, a prominent right-wing think tank, has recently put forth an innovative proposal for a 1p per unit surcharge on alcohol sales to fund much-needed rehabilitation programs for alcoholics in the United Kingdom. This bold initiative tackles the alcohol abuse crisis while acknowledging the need for accessible and affordable recovery options for those suffering from alcoholism. Under this proposed scheme, the cost of an average bottle of wine would increase by a mere 10p, while the price of pints of low-strength beer would rise by 2p and continental lager by 3p. These minuscule surcharges could generate a significant amount of funding for rehabilitation facilities and support programs aimed at helping alcoholics regain control over their lives. Alcohol abuse remains a critical issue in the UK, with devastating consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. The surcharge proposal addresses the urgency of the problem while simultaneously leveraging the alcohol sales industry to provide essential financial support for rehabilitation services. The benefits of such a small surcharge on alcohol unit prices are manifold. First, it can actively contribute to the creation of new rehabilitation facilities with modern, evidence-based treatment methods. Moreover, the additional funding would allow existing rehabilitation clinics to expand or enhance their programs and services to accommodate a larger number of recovering alcoholics. One of the key advantages of the 1p per unit surcharge is that it will not disproportionately affect those from lower income brackets. Despite the minimal increase, consumers are likely to remain undeterred from purchasing their preferred beverages. Consequently, the surcharge will not compromise inclusivity, as the price hikes will remain economically sustainable for a vast majority of individuals. The UK government has implemented various taxes and regulations on alcohol consumption in the past to curb the rising rates of alcohol-related disorders. Although these initiatives have yielded mixed results, the proposed 1p per unit surcharge is unique in its approach. By earmarking the collected funds explicitly for rehabilitation efforts, this proposal directly addresses the need for accessible and affordable recovery options for alcohol addicts. Critics might argue that implementing this surcharge places an undue burden on alcohol consumers, effectively punishing them for the poor choices and actions of others. However, the proposal ensures that the surcharge remains marginal and is socially fair by refraining from singling out any particular group of consumers.  In conclusion, the Centre for Social Justice's proposal for a 1p per unit surcharge on alcohol sales is both innovative and promising. By leveraging alcohol sales to generate funds for rehabilitation programs, the proposal offers a sustainable and intelligent solution to address the ever-growing need for accessible treatment options for alcoholics across the United Kingdom. With minimal price increases that are unlikely to deter consumption, this surcharge presents a socially fair and effective means of raising much-needed funding for alcohol rehabilitation, all the while tackling a significant public health issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Why are you study habits different from those of your friends? Why do you seem to learn faster in some classes while more slowly in others? One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic  .  Visual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you. Auditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy. Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it. Of course, you can learn best by making full use of labs or other class activities. Hope you learn better by knowing what your personal learning type is.

In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees.

They were given a titular church in Rome or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.  Step 2: Look for specific locations While the original text does not provide specific locations outside of Rome where ecclesiastics were assigned, it does mention they were appointed from \\"outside Rome,\\" which means they could have come from any location within the broader Church hierarchy. Step 3: Deduction Based on the given information, we cannot pinpoint specific locations where these ecclesiastics were assigned. However, we can deduce that they came from various locations outside Rome, likely from different cities and regions in Italy and possibly even from other countries, depending on the Pope's connections and preferences.

Job 2 - The second job was more of a career in the insurance industry , where he would start at the bottom, and after many years and many long hours eventually rise to the top (if he was good).

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

People will need to do your work while you're gone; you should make this as easy as possible for them, without overburdening any one person. The Harvard Business Review suggests you “prepare a list of your core responsibilities, dividing them into tasks that can be assumed by other and those that aren't so easy to delegate, such as client relationships.” Think about who in your organization might fill each role, and consider hiring someone to cover for you if necessary. This involves more than just telling the good news that you're pregnant. You'll also need to let them know the additional responsibilities they'll be taking on. This does not have to be a burden for them. Especially for subordinates, it can be an opportunity to take on new, higher-level responsibilities and to progress their career. You'll need to let your clients know that you will be stepping away, and also introduce them to the person who will be taking over for you in your absence. If you serve as the primary contact for anyone else – suppliers if you're a restaurant manager, for instance – you'll need to let them know your plans, too. The more you can tie-up before you leave, the less you will have to stress about while gone, and the easier the transition will be for your coworkers. It can be very hard to step right in after 3 months away if you have not kept in touch. Your company should know that you will not always be available, but do plan to check in regularly by email or via a short, weekly scheduled call. If you are going to be heading back to full-time work, there is a good chance you will need to enroll your child in daycare or to find a nanny. You don't have to wait until your child is born to start looking.  Daycare – Ask for friend's recommendations. Look for a daycare that is near your home or work, and which offers flexible pick-up and drop-off times. Visit and talk to the staff about their philosophies on childcare and discipline. Nanny – Nannies are more expensive, but they also offer more flexibility for working parents. To cut the cost, consider a nanny-share. These work best if the children are about the same age and the parents have similar child-raising philosophies, so choose people you know, or be sure to interview both the nanny and the parents you will be sharing with. Partner - Your partner's company may have better leave policies than your own. If your partner can get paid leave, then consider having him or her stay home with the baby while you transition back to work. Knowing your partner is home with the baby can make for a much less stressful transition than sending your child to daycare. Don't forget the little things. It's best to take any personal belongings you treasure home, as you can't be certain they won't be disturbed. In some cases, another worker might even be using your desk when you're gone, so be sure to also remove personal files like performance reviews. And don't forget to set out-of-office messages that tell the caller or emailer who they can contact in your absence.

They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village harmed less fisheries?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] The answer is:","output":"Davin village harmed less fisheries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer provided does not accurately answer the question regarding who accompanied King Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade. Therefore, I would advise against validating this answer in its current form.  A more detailed and appropriate response to the question would be: King Louis VII of France was accompanied by several key figures during the Second Crusade (1147-1149). Most notably, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, his wife at the time, accompanied him, bringing her own contingent of troops from Aquitaine. Other important participants who joined the French King on the crusade include nobleman Thierry of Alsace, Count of Flanders, Robert I, Count of Dreux, who was King Louis VII's brother, William, Count of Nevers, and Alphonse I, Count of Toulouse. The famous abbot, Suger of Saint-Denis, who served as regent during Louis VII's absence, played a crucial role in supporting and encouraging the King's participation in the crusade. The primary goal of the Second Crusade was to reclaim the city of Edessa, which had been captured by Muslim forces led by Imad ad-Din Zengi in 1144, consequently threatening the Christian presence in the region. The crusade was officially endorsed by Pope Eugene III and had significant participation not only from the French forces led by King Louis VII but also from the Holy Roman Empire forces, which were spearheaded by King Conrad III of Germany. In summary, numerous individuals accompanied King Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade, but some of the most essential figures were Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, Thierry of Alsace, Robert I of Dreux, William of Nevers, and Alphonse I of Toulouse. As a result, the suggested answer initially provided does not directly address the main question, and it would be inappropriate to validate it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"1\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many hijackers have been named?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"1\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"How many hijackers have been named?\\".

Question: After the Japanese leave where does Miller hide the girls? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Flowers of War Context: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

If you've ever dreamed of a fairytale tree house, complete with twinkling lights and romantic bridges, it probably looks a lot like this. The Buckland retreat, nestled in pristine woodland in the heart of Atlanta, has now been listed on AirBnB, and it even comes with wifi! Set amid the branches of a 150-year-old Southern Short-Leaf Pine tree, the enchanting tree house is the handywork of creative couple Peter and Katie Bahouth, and consists of three separate rooms that are connected by rope bridges strewn with fairy lights. If you go down to the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise... This stunning tree house is nestled amid lush woodland in Atlanta. Peter and Katie Bahouth bought the land in 2000 and spent six months designing and building the fairytale retreat, which they now rent out. Former Greenpeace executive director Mr Bahouth, bought the pretty woodland spot in 2000, and spent the next six months designing and building the perfect forest hideaway. The cosy living room is decked out with a masterful blend of beautiful antiques and up-cycled furniture, including a chandelier to add a touch a glamour to scheme, and an 80-year-old butterfly window. And just in case you feel like entertaining, there is even an indoor dining area with room to comfortably seat six people. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the interior with natural light, while pretty fairy lights and swishy curtains add a dash of romance to the scheme. The rustic living room has been decked out with shabby chic furniture, while colourful accessories add warmth to the cosy scheme. Over in the bedroom, you'll be able to enjoy nature without leaving the comfort of your bed, as it can be pushed out onto a platform overlooking a local stream. You don't even have to worry about catching a chill  - the  organic linen bedding has been teamed with a heated mattress pad to keep you toasty all night long. The tree house consists of three separate rooms which can be reached via rope bridges strewn with fairy lights to light the way. Outside, a generous decking area seats up to 10 people and comes complete with a hammock for day-time dreaming or star-spotting at night. But if you do get the urge to leave the confines of the tee house, the Bahouth's have provided a list of local beauty spots to explore. Or, like some guests, you could just order pizza delivered straight to your branch. But enchanting beauty doesn't come cheap. A minimum two night stay at the retreat will set you back £236 per night - but we reckon it's worth it! The couple have even installed wifi in the tree house for those guests who feel the need to stay connected to the outside world. Pretty mirrored furniture and pooling curtains create a sense of romance in the retreat's only bedroom. The luxurious double bed is on wheels and can be pushed out onto the mezzanine for guests who want sleep outdoors. It's no surprise this Peter Pan-style tree house comes with a five-star rating from former guests. One former occupant called Brent said: 'I surprised my wife with a visit for her birthday. The whole visit was like something out of a fairy tale... all lit up in the night. 'I enjoyed the rickety bridge and the feeling that we were on a pirate ship. Every detail is quirky and fun, including a bed that pushes out on a track so you can sleep on a plank under a canopy of trees - unbelievable.' But don't worry, you won't catch a chill.

A gym’s main benefit is convenience: it has cardio machines, weight machines, and free weights (among other equipment) all in 1 place. If your main exercise goals are to improve your heart rate, lose weight, or bulk up on muscle, a gym is the best place to start.  Don’t worry about feeling intimidated by other gym members, either. Most people at gyms are supportive of one another, and mind their own business. Average gym membership costs can range from 20-45 USD per month. If that’s more than you can afford, try looking around for a discount gym in your area. Discount gyms may have fewer machines and weights, but can cost as little as 10 USD per month. Yoga is a great add-on exercise to a cardio routine, and it is very relaxing. Look into yoga if you’d like a calming, centering experience that also stretches and builds tone in your muscles. Many YouTube channels offer yoga guidance. You can also look into taking a yoga class at a nearby gym. Being around a group of other people who are doing the same exercise routine as you are can be fun. You’ll be motivated to keep up with everybody else in the group, and can make some friends among your classmates. Taking classes is also a great way to figure out which type of exercise you enjoy most and would like to pursue further. Most gyms and workout facilities offer classes at all different skill levels. If you’re just starting a new type of exercise—e.g., a spin class or yoga class—check out the beginner-level course. A trainer can familiarize you with the gym, show you how equipment works, and answer any exercise-related questions you may have. Even if you don’t plan to work with a personal trainer long-term, having 2 or 3 sessions with a trainer can be a great way to learn about different types of exercise and find one that you enjoy.  Depending on the gym you’re a member at, you may be entitled to a free session with a personal trainer just for signing up. Once the free sessions have expired, you’ll be looking at an average cost of 80-125 USD per session to work with the trainers. If you’d like a less-expensive option, see if trainers at the gym offer group-training sessions.  You can also hire a private personal trainer to come to your home, but this is a much more expensive option. If you don’t have the time or money to purchase a gym membership, you can easily find ways to work out at your own home. You can purchase a few small weights and do simple exercises while lying on your bed. Or, carry a heavy object around with you while you’re going about your day. You can purchase barbells or dumbbells at a local sport-supply store. If you’re more inclined towards cardio, purchase a jump rope and jump for 15–20 minutes a day. Nobody starts out curling 85 pounds (39 kg) or bench pressing 200 pounds (91 kg). Begin your weight training with simple, reliable workouts that effectively build muscle. Start doing 4 to 8 different exercises, making sure to work out different muscle groups. Don't go for heavy weight when you start—it's better to lift lighter and maintain the right form. Good weight lifts include:   Squats, lunges, deadlifts, and step-ups for the lower body.  Push-ups, pull-ups, rowing, and free weights for the upper body. Planks and sit-ups for your core muscles. Take steps to avoid sore muscles if it becomes a problem. If you have a smartphone or tablet, download 1 or 2 fitness tracker apps to log your progress and monitor weekly improvements. Using an app can help motivate you to work out regularly, by allowing you to track calories, steps, sleep cycles, and other elements related to exercise and health. Try out apps like:  MyFitnessPal, which allows you to track calories in the food you eat and features a step counter. Sworkit, which provides exercise videos that show you how to perform over 200 types of workout. MapMyRun, which will present you with multiple route options in your area based on how far and long you want to run for. It’s easy to get burned out on exercise if you’re doing it alone. To prevent this fatigue, find a friend who wants to start an exercise program too. Ask if they’d like to join you on your bi-weekly trips to the gym, or a daily jog. Having a friend or 2 around to work out with will help keep you accountable and ensure that you stick to your exercise schedule. If you have a friend who already regularly works out, ask if you can join in on their schedule.","output":"This article highlights the benefits of joining a gym for convenience, access to various equipment, and supportive environment, while also discussing alternative options like discount gyms, yoga, personal trainers, exercising at home, and finding workout buddies for motivation and accountability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The situation is extremely dangerous, but panicking will only hinder your ability to adapt to the situation and survive.  Breathing techniques are an excellent way to keep calm, if the air is not too smoky already. Choices:  a). If heat is roaring, then you will need to do things fast to stay more composed. If you are alone in the chamber, you may need to prepare some blankets and cover to minimize the heat.;  b). The reason fires are less dangerous is because water is more concentrated in the air.

Take a deep breath in for four seconds, then exhale slowly for four seconds. Repeat until you feel more calm and in control, but again, if the air is already smokey you should not take deep breaths.

It tells us HOW to do these breathing techniques, just like someone teaching you how to do something. It says to breathe in slowly for four seconds and then breathe out slowly for four seconds too. This sounds very calming! Option a) goes off-topic and talks about what to do if heat is roaring or if you're alone in a chamber. This is not about the breathing techniques the story was talking about. Option b) is incorrect because it is not very logical.

In 1997, Rachel is honoured by her daughter Sarah during a release party in Tel Aviv for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.

How will the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes help in reducing black money and corruption? How will black money and corruption be stopped by banning 500 and 1000 notes? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from the following. - no; - yes;","output":"- yes; Both questions essentially ask how the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will help in reducing black money and corruption. The focus of both questions is to understand the impact of banning these currency denominations on black money and corruption. Now, let's focus on answering the question: Scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes can help in reducing black money and corruption by: 1. Eliminating counterfeit currency: One of the main objectives of demonetization is to eliminate counterfeit currency in circulation, which is often used to fund illegal activities and corruption. By removing these high denomination notes that are easier to counterfeit, the government can strike a significant blow to the operations of counterfeiters. 2. Encouraging digital transactions: Scrapping high denomination notes can facilitate a shift toward digital transactions. When people use digital payment methods, the transactions are recorded, making it difficult for individuals to engage in corruption or tax evasion, as their transactions can be traced. 3. Uncovering undeclared income: When high denomination notes are scrapped, people holding large sums of undeclared income in cash must either deposit the money into a bank account or exchange it for new notes. This may lead to the declaration of previously undisclosed income, helping the government track and tax black money. 4. Disrupting corruption and black money networks: Large cash transactions in high denomination notes are often linked to corruption and black money. By scrapping these notes, the government forces individuals and businesses to find alternative ways to conduct transactions, often using more transparent channels, which can help curb corruption and slow down black money generation. 5. Temporarily limiting means to buy influence: In the short term, the scrapping of high denomination notes can make it more difficult for people to engage in corrupt activities and buy illegal goods or influence as cash is the preferred mode of payment in such transactions. This creates an environment that discourages corruption, even if temporarily. Overall, the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes can have a significant impact on reducing black money and corruption, though it's essential to note that this is not a comprehensive solution. Long-term strategies to tackle corruption require systemic changes, including improving governance, transparency, and law enforcement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Programming in anderoid mobile? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"After analyzing both questions, I can conclude that they are not the same. They address different topics and require separate responses: 1. The first question asks about people with black money evading the demonetisation process. This is related to finance and economics. 2. The second question refers to programming in Android mobile devices, which is about software development and technology. Now, I will attempt to address both questions independently. 1. Evading demonetisation: People with black money may have used different methods to escape the demonetisation process: a. Converting cash into other assets: Some individuals might have invested their black money in gold, real estate, or other physical assets. This would help them avoid depositing cash in banks, where it would be subject to scrutiny. b. Swapping old notes for new notes: People may have approached others to swap their old currency notes with new ones, allowing them to keep their undeclared income out of banks. c. Money laundering: Black money holders could have used other people's bank accounts (such as friends, family, or even dummy accounts) to deposit and later withdraw new currency notes. d. Hiding funds in shell companies: Some people might have hidden their undeclared income by channeling it through shell companies, which can be a way of avoiding taxes and scrutiny from the authorities. 2. Programming in Android mobile: This question seems to inquire about developing applications for Android mobile devices. To do this, developers typically use Android Studio, an integrated development environment provided by Google. a. Install Android Studio: First, download and install Android Studio on your computer, which will include required libraries and the SDK for Android development. b. Learn programming languages: Obtain knowledge in Java or Kotlin, which are the programming languages associated with Android application development. c. Create a new project: Open Android Studio, and start a new project. Follow the setup wizard and select a suitable template for your application. d. Write the code: Use Java or Kotlin to write the code for your application in the provided editor. Develop the desired functionality based on your initial idea. e. Test the application: Utilize Android Studio's built-in emulator or a physical Android device to test your application, making necessary changes and fixing any issues. f. Publish the app: Once you're satisfied with your application, you can publish it to the Google Play Store for others to download and use.

In this case, we need to get rid of the -14 on the right side by adding 14 to both sides of the equation. -10 = 2*a - 14 -10 + 14 = 2*a - 14 + 14 Step 2: Simplify. Now, we simplify the expression by combining the constants on the left side of the equation. 4 = 2*a For the right side of the equation, since the -14 and +14 cancel each other out, it leaves us with just 2*a: 4 = 2*a Step 3: Solve for a. Now, to find the value of a, we need to isolate a by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. This is because the coefficient of a is 2 (i.e., a is being multiplied by 2). By dividing both sides by 2, we are essentially undoing this multiplication. 4 / 2 = 2*a / 2 Step 4: Simplify again. Now, we simplify the expression by dividing the constants on the left side of the equation and canceling out the 2's on the right side of the equation. 2 = a Thus, the solution to the equation -10 = 2*a - 14 is a = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What group of people were the most abundant in Brazil in 1872? ?  White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. The answer is:","output":"The most abundant group of people in Brazil in 1872 were the browns, comprising 38.3% of the population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A California judge has thrown out a proposed ballot initiative that advocated killing anyone who engages in gay sex, calling the measure \\"patently unconstitutional.\\"      Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Raymond Cadei relieved California's attorney general late Monday of the duty to clear the so-called Sodomite Suppression Act for signature-gathering. Cadei said it would be \\"inappropriate, waste public resources, generate unnecessary divisions among the public, and tend to mislead the electorate\\" for Attorney General Kamala Harris to process the proposal.      Harris had asked for a judge's permission in March to reject the initiative through a legal complaint against its sponsor, Orange County lawyer Matthew McLaughlin. After McLaughlin did not attempt to defend the measure in court, the attorney general last week sought a default ruling in her favor, a request Cadei granted.      \\"This proposed act is the product of bigotry, seeks to promote violence, is patently unconstitutional and has no place in a civil society. I applaud the court's decision to block its title and summary,\\" Harris said in a statement Tuesday.      McLaughlin did not immediately reply to a telephone call seeking comment on Tuesday. He has not commented publicly on his motivations for pursuing the initiative since he paid 200 to submit it for processing.      The initiative sought to amend the California penal code to make sex with a person of the same gender an offense punishable by \\"bullets to the head or by any other convenient method.\\" It also would have made the distribution of gay \\"propaganda\\" punishable by a 1 million fine or banishment from the state.      Harris has said that if a judge did not block the measure, she would have had no choice but to give McLaughlin the go-ahead to seek the nearly 366,000 votes needed to qualify the measure for the November 2016 ballot.      The attorney general has not attempted to stop another citizen's initiative that has worried LGBT groups in California. Her office on Tuesday issued an official title and summary for a proposed law that would require transgender people to use the public building restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their birth sex instead of the gender with which they identify.      Transgender people with a revised birth certificate, a court order recognizing a gender change or medical evidence of transitioning would be exempt from the law, which also seeks to authorize private businesses to enact similar restrictions on bathroom use.      California's legislative analyst says the initiative violates state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity and gender expression. If it qualifies for the ballot and is approved by voters, the measure also could put the state at risk of losing federal funds if the U.S. government determines that it conflicts with laws and regulations covering sex discrimination. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

To properly answer the question, you should provide the criteria that define a dwarf planet. A dwarf planet is a celestial body that fulfills the following criteria, as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU): 1. It orbits the Sun (or any other star in the case of extrasolar planetary systems). 2. It has sufficient mass and gravity to assume a nearly round shape. This happens when a celestial body has enough mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and achieve hydrostatic equilibrium. 3. It has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other debris and celestial bodies. This means that a dwarf planet may have other objects in its orbital path, unlike a full-fledged planet which would have \\"cleared the area.\\" 4. It is not a moon or satellite of another celestial body. Dwarf planets are distinct from standard planets primarily due to not having cleared the neighborhood around their orbits.

Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, making it possible to improve the damping of spurious resonances.

You can find tung oil at a local paint store or hardware store.  1 quart (0.95 L) of tung oil or Waterlox will cover about 15 feet (4.6 m) of butcher block. If you’d rather apply a longer-lasting product than tung oil, you can seal the butcher block using a more substantial chemical sealant, like Waterlox. Both products are food-safe. Dip a clean, dry cotton cloth or rag into the container of tung oil or Waterlox. Then use the cloth to rub the sealant across the surface of the stained butcher block. Work in long, straight strokes that parallel the direction of the boards in the butcher block. Give the sealant a full 12 hours to dry. Sealing the butcher block is a time-consuming process. It will need several layers of tung oil or Waterlox. Use the same method for each layer: saturate a clean rag with sealant and then rub it along the surface of the butcher block. Use a clean cloth to remove any excess sealant. Ensure that each layer has at least 12 hours to dry before applying the subsequent layer. Avoid using the counter for 7 full days so the oil has enough time to fully soak into the wood. Once the week has passed, you can use your stained butcher block counters.

Who does the man that killed the bounty hunter's wife pay to help him?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A preacher witnesses his family and a group of refugees seeking shelter in his church murdered by a gang of ruthless outlaws led by Colonel Cusack.  After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie, takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack.  Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses.  The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang. The Preacher, now armed, tells the Sheriff that the squatters have a right to stay. Gunfire ensues, and The Preacher shoots the sheriff. The rest of the bad guys run off. A:","output":"Based on the given context, the man that kills the bounty hunter's wife is Colonel Cusack. Colonel Cusack is the leader of the gang of ruthless outlaws who murders the preacher's family and the group of refugees seeking shelter in his church. In this story, Colonel Cusack has the local sheriff on his payroll, meaning he pays the sheriff in exchange for his loyalty and assistance in carrying out various illegal activities, such as running off squatters from the land they rightfully paid for. The sheriff and his gang, under the financial influence of Colonel Cusack, act as allies to him and his outlaw gang. Colonel Cusack's attempts to further extend this network of allies by trying to persuade the preacher, now a bounty hunter, to join his mob. When the preacher refuses to join Cusack's gang, the situation escalates as the sheriff's posse, loyal to Cusack, starts to target those who are either helping or being helped by the preacher. For instance, they send a message to the preacher by roughing up Maggie, a woman with a past who taked the preacher into her home after he was beaten up defending another woman in a saloon. However, the preacher is prepared to take a stand against both Cusack and the crooked sheriff. He reclaims his weapon, confronts the sheriff and his gang, and ultimately shoots the sheriff in order to protect the rights of the squatters. This action leads to a disruption in the alliance between Colonel Cusack and the sheriff, as the remaining bad guys from the sheriff's gang flee the scene after witnessing the preacher's determination and courage. In summary, Colonel Cusack, in his role as the main villain, pays the local sheriff to work with him and carries out various unlawful activities.

He cleverly stops the truck, and when the LA County authorities find only gasoline in the tank, he shoots the tank and cocaine pours out of the bullet hole. Meanwhile, Cash arrives at his apartment driving an old Corvette. His hair is long and shaggy, and he is dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and a waist-length jacket. He is shot by an intruder, but is protected by a bullet-proof vest, and captures the shooter in a parking garage after a car chase. At the police station, Cash forces the shooter to tell him about a deal scheduled to take place that night.However, the \\"deal\\" is really a plan by Perret to frame Tango and Cash for murder. Tango and Cash separately go to an empty building, preceded by a man who is revealed later in the film to be Requin (Brion James), Perret's lead henchman. After surprising each other, the two detectives find a dead man with audio equipment hidden under his clothing, and a team of FBI agents swarms in. Wyler, the agent in charge, finds Cash's pistol on the floor and arrests both Cash and Tango.At their murder trial, the detectives are incriminated by an audio tape, secretly given to Wyler by Requin and verified in court by an audio expert, which appears to reveal them shooting the FBI agent after discussing a drug purchase. They plead \\"no contest\\" to a lesser charge in exchange for reduced sentences in a minimum-security prison, but are transported to a maximum-security prison to be housed with many of the criminals they arrested in the past.Once in prison, Tango and Cash are rousted from their bunks and tortured by Perret, Requin, and a gang of prisoners until Matt Sokowski, the assistant warden, rescues them. Sokowski recommends that they escape, and provides them with a plan, but Tango refuses to go along with it. When Cash tries to escape, he finds Sokowski murdered and is attacked by prisoners.

Context: Austria-Hungary precipitated the Bosnian crisis of 1908-1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878. This angered the Kingdom of Serbia and its patron, the Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russian Empire. Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the \\"powder keg of Europe.\\" In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting Treaty of London further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian state while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania in the 33-day Second Balkan War, further destabilising the region. The Great Powers were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.

Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible, and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge. But after the first season, the show started degrading, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real. The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode, but in the end, this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show. If you are gonna watch it, go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second. Thereafter I would not waste my time. Myself, I gave the show up midway through season 3.

Now, let's analyze the information given about the two patients: 1. Patient A has a high blood glucose level. 2. Patient B has a low blood glucose level. Since insulin helps to lower blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake into cells, logically, a person with high blood glucose levels, such as patient A, would require more insulin to help reduce their blood sugar. On the other hand, a person with low blood glucose levels, like patient B, would require less insulin, as their body is already effectively regulating their blood sugar levels.

No.","output":"[c]. No. It would be incorrect to draw the conclusion that Hector and the Search for Happiness has no story. The film is based on the novel by François Lelord and has a plot that follows the journey of the protagonist, Hector, a psychiatrist played by Simon Pegg. The narrative centers around Hector's quest for happiness, which involves him traveling around the world and encountering different people and cultures as he searches for the secret to a happy life. He embarks on this journey because he feels disillusioned with his own life and that of his patients, who struggle to find happiness despite their material wealth. Through Hector's journey, the filmmakers explore various themes, including self-discovery, the meaning of happiness, and the societal pressures that may impact an individual's pursuit of happiness. Along the way, Hector interacts with different characters, including his girlfriend Clara, portrayed by Rosamund Pike, who has contrasting opinions and beliefs about the concept of happiness. These character interactions allow the narrative to delve into different perspectives on happiness and its complexities. The story is presented as a comedy-drama and incorporates elements of humor, adventure, and drama. As Hector meets new individuals during his travels, he learns valuable life lessons that ultimately contribute to his understanding of happiness. These elements collectively form a coherent narrative that explores the concept of happiness in a meaningful and entertaining manner. Therefore, it is not accurate to conclude that Hector and the Search for Happiness has no story.

Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.

Ben's girlfriend said, \\"It's just like the present you gave me! It makes me so happy to see it.\\" They decided to follow the butterfly to see where it was going. It led them to a magical garden with lots of flowers and more butterflies like the one they followed. There were also bees buzzing around, collecting nectar to make yummy honey. Ben and his girlfriend played with the butterflies and smelled the flowers. They felt happy and grateful for the trust and love that they shared. From that day on, they continued to tell each other the truth and surprise each other with little presents. Their relationship grew even stronger, just like the roots of a big tree that can stand tall through rain and sunshine. And they lived happily ever after, always remembering the beautiful day at the park when they followed the rainbow butterfly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible answers: [I] Samuel was grateful.. [II] Craig was grateful..","output":"Over the course of his recovery period, Samuel was immensely grateful for the unwavering support and assistance that his close friend Craig provided. As someone who had always been fiercely independent, Samuel found it difficult to rely on others for help, especially in vulnerable situations such as this one where his physical health was compromised. Despite his initial hesitance, the sheer compassion and patience exhibited by Craig had a profound impact on Samuel. Craig took on the role of caretaker without any expectations or demands, offering his time, resources, and emotional support to Samuel in the form he needed the most. From brewing hot cups of herbal tea to picking up prescriptions and medications, making nourishing meals, and keeping Samuel company during the long, sleepless nights, Craig did everything in his power to alleviate Samuel's discomfort and facilitate his journey to recovery. As Samuel started to regain his strength, he found himself experiencing a whole new level of appreciation for their friendship. Craig had not only been a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on, but had also taught Samuel the invaluable lesson of accepting help from those who genuinely care. The bond between them had grown stronger than ever, with a newfound sense of trust and mutual understanding. Meanwhile, Craig was grateful as well for the opportunity to be there for his friend. Although it was undoubtedly a taxing and challenging experience, seeing Samuel recover and regain his health was worth every sleep-deprived night and every exhausting day. In the process, Craig discovered just how deep their bond ran and how much strength it provided both of them in times of need. Moreover, stepping into the shoes of a caretaker allowed Craig to develop a heightened sense of empathy and concern for those around him, making him a better friend and overall a more compassionate human being. Assisting Samuel through this trying time had also taught Craig the true meaning of friendship - it extended beyond casual conversations and nights out, manifesting in a genuine, unwavering commitment to support and care for one another in the darkest of hours. In the aftermath of Samuel's recovery, both friends found themselves changed in subtle yet significant ways. For Samuel, the experience not only strengthened his bond with Craig but had also made him more open to relying on others in times of need. For Craig, it solidified his understanding of the importance of compassion, empathy, and being there for those he loved. Ultimately, as Samuel's health continued to improve and both friends returned to their normal routines, they carried with them a genuine and lasting realization: true friendship knows no bounds and can endure even the most difficult of trials, making both friends more resilient and closer than ever before."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A:","output":"A: The last step of the process after completing all the tasks mentioned would be to: 1. Close the dishwasher: Gently push the bottom rack back into the dishwasher, ensuring that it slides in smoothly and is properly positioned. Make sure none of the dishes are obstructing the rack from fitting into place or blocking the spinning arms. Next, carefully close the dishwasher door, ensuring that it is completely shut and securely latched. The door must be properly closed to prevent any leaks and ensure the dishwasher runs efficiently. 2. Adjust settings and start the wash cycle: Once the dishwasher is securely closed, check and confirm the appropriate wash settings for the specific load of dishes you have. You can choose between various settings such as heavy, normal, light, or eco, depending on the dishwasher model and the user's preferences. Some dishwashers also have additional options such as high-temperature wash, sanitize, or delay start. Select the desired settings, keeping in mind the soil level of the dishes and any other specific requirements. 3. Activate the dishwasher: After selecting the appropriate wash settings, press the \\"Start\\" or \\"Power\\" button, depending on your dishwasher model, to activate the dishwasher and begin the wash cycle. The dishwasher will now start filling with water, automatically dispensing the detergent from the soap cup, and spraying water throughout the dishwasher to clean the dishes.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise \\"I am sorry, my friends\\" seems to contradict the hypothesis \\"I refused to apologize for anything.\\" To analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, let us first break down the meaning of each statement and examine their logical structure. Premise: \\"I am sorry, my friends.\\" The premise here is an apology directed towards an unspecified group of friends. By apologizing, the speaker acknowledges that they have done something wrong or caused some harm, whether intentional or unintentional, and seeks forgiveness or understanding from the affected friends. The statement implies remorse and a willingness to take responsibility for one's actions. Hypothesis: \\"I refused to apologize for anything.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, represents a stance in which the individual is unwilling to admit wrongdoing or take responsibility for their actions. By refusing to apologize, the person conveys that they do not believe they have made any mistakes or caused any harm, or they might simply refuse to acknowledge it. This attitude contrasts with the willingness to apologize and express regret demonstrated in the premise. Now, examining the relationship of the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that they are logically opposed. The premise \\"I am sorry, my friends\\" entails an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, remorse for one's actions, and the desire for forgiveness or understanding. Meanwhile, the hypothesis \\"I refused to apologize for anything\\" denies any acknowledgment of wrongdoing, remorse, or willingness to apologize. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis but rather contradicts it. The two statements express different attitudes and viewpoints concerning the act of apologizing and admitting responsibility for one's actions. While the premise demonstrates an individual's remorse and willingness to make amends, the hypothesis suggests a refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing or offer an apology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says \`Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap. *possible spoilers from here on* Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was \`Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet. You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were \`well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, \`You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words \`the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. \`The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake. Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read \`the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the \`one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way. A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection \`started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. \`Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well. Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is highly negative and disappointed. The reviewer expresses frustration and dissatisfaction with the American adaptation of the Pokémon movies, particularly in regards to changes and alterations made to the plot, characters, and overall message.

A: Available options:  a). substrates;  b). phospholipids;  c). hydrogen;  d). peptidoglycan; Answer:","output":"d). peptidoglycan The cell wall is an essential part of bacterial cells that provides structural support, maintains cell shape, and prevents them from bursting in a hypotonic environment. Bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes have different types of cell walls, which contribute to the functional and taxonomic distinctions between the three domains of life. In bacteria, the cell wall is composed mainly of peptidoglycan, also known as murein. Peptidoglycan is a complex polymer that consists of two types of sugar molecules, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM), linked via β(1→4) glycosidic bonds. These glycan strands form a lattice-like structure that surrounds the cell. Interspersed within this sugar network are peptide chains (usually short, 3-5 amino acids in length), which are attached to the NAM sugar unit. The peptide chains crosslink adjacent glycan strands, creating a mesh-like structure that provides rigidity and strength to the cell wall. The peptidoglycan layer is unique to bacteria and not found in archaea or eukaryotes. In archaea, the cell wall is composed of various molecules called pseudopeptidoglycans or other unique polymers, such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or proteins. These structures may provide similar functions as the bacterial cell wall, but their biochemical composition and organization are significantly different. Eukaryotic cells can also have cell walls, but these are primarily found in plants, algae, and fungi. The main constituent of the eukaryotic cell wall is cellulose, a polysaccharide composed of glucose molecules linked via β(1→4) glycosidic bonds. Unlike peptidoglycan, cellulose does not contain peptide chains. Plant cell walls may also contain other polysaccharides like hemicellulose and pectin, as well as proteins and lignin for additional support. Interestingly, the presence of peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls is also a target for many antibiotics, such as penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. These drugs disrupt the synthesis or cross-linking of peptidoglycan, weakening the cell wall and ultimately leading to cell lysis and bacterial death. In summary, the cell wall in bacteria is made of peptidoglycan, a complex polymer that consists of sugar molecules and peptide chains. This structure is unique to bacteria and provides critical structural support to the cell. It is distinct from the cell walls of archaea and eukaryotes, which have different compositions and architectures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: As a goalie, you are in the unique position among your teammates that you can see the entire field of play. By paying close to the game at all times, you not only help your team gain advantages, but also ensure that you’re prepared to defend the goal if the opposing team charges it. Always keep your eye on the ball, even if it’s at the other end of the field. You wouldn’t want to be surprised if it is kicked to your end of the field. Since a goalie can see the entire field of play in soccer, it is important for him to effectively communicate what he sees to his teammates. This will help them know which opponents to watch or any patterns of play. The goalie can also provide motivation for tired or lagging teammates.  Tell your teammates about certain opponents or patterns of play either during a time out or while they’re on the field. It’s important that they know these things because it not only helps them on the field, but also will help them do their job defending you and the goal area. You can also develop and use hand gesture to cue your teammates about opponents or your own planned course of action. Don't shout at your teammates too often.  Be specific, concise, and decisive in your suggestions, but deliver the message in a polite manner. Remember, that you’re not the coach. If an opposing player is charging down the field to take a shot on goal, your job as goalie is to anticipate what move he’s going to make and then aggressively defend the goal. How you react in these situations can the difference between a save and the other team scoring.  Charge oncoming players to cut down the angle of their kicks and to make yourself bigger. Charging is also a useful tool to intimidate opposing players. Moving your legs and standing on the tips of your toes will help you react more quickly to incoming plays. Those few split seconds often make a big difference in the outcome of a situation. Make yourself larger inside the goal to intimidate charging players. You can do this by raising your hands above your head or holding them out to your side. This is also a psychological trick used to make a kicker unsure of where he is kicking the ball. Reading the body language of players coming down the field. For example, if you notice a player planting his foot to kick, you can easily anticipate that the ball will follow the trajectory of the shot. Watching a player’s eyes can also give you cues about where he plans to kick the ball. Any ball traveling in the direction of the goalie can end up between the goal posts. It’s important to actively anticipate and attack any ball that comes towards you so that you don’t give the other team easy goals. Meaning, even if it is kicked higher than your height, jump! There are different ways to defend the goal area from catching the ball to kicking it or punching it out over the net. Choosing which defense strategy you use will depend on how the ball is approaching the goal area.  Catch the ball when you can. This will give you the option to punt it towards your teammates, giving them a chance at a goal. When you catch a ball to save it from going in the goal, you have two options of how to play it: you can either throw it back to your teammates with your hands or directly kick it to one of your teammates further down the field. There are times when it is not practical to catch the ball, for example if it is kicked too high or too fast. In these cases, you can deflect the ball with the palm of your hand or the tips of your fingers, or you can punch it over the net. Kick the ball without first catching it only in an emergency situation, such as an immediate threat to the goal area. If a ball is low to the ground or approaching you at a flat angle, dive for it and then get up quickly. Get up quickly if you dive, catch or kick a ball. You never know when you'll need to make a second save. Summary:","output":"As a goalie, you have the advantage of seeing the entire field of play and should maintain constant focus on the game to effectively defend the goal. Efficient communication with your teammates is crucial, informing them about opponents, patterns of play, and using hand gestures to guide them in the game. Always be polite and concise while giving suggestions. Anticipating the moves of the opposing players and aggressively defending the goal is your primary responsibility. Make yourself appear larger to intimidate them and read their body language to gauge their next move.  Actively anticipate and attack any ball coming your way and choose the appropriate defense strategy depending on the ball's approach. Catch the ball when possible, giving you the option to either throw or kick it back to your teammates. Deflect or punch the ball when catching is not feasible. Dive for low balls and always get back up quickly, staying prepared for any additional saves needed. In summary, a goalie's role involves effective communication, anticipation, and quick reactions to successfully defend the goal and assist their teammates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At that point our teachers were helping to translate so I understood more . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why was the narrator moved by the cemetary ?","output":"The narrator was moved by the cemetery experience for several reasons: 1. Presence of a knowledgeable guide: The fact that someone with extensive knowledge in the field came and talked to the narrator and their group had a significant impact. This person was able to share their wisdom, insights, and passion, allowing the narrator to gain a deeper understanding of the cemetery and its significance. 2. Connection to famous activists: The guide led the group around the cemetery, pointing out the graves and memorials of well-known activists.

Role of educators in translation: The narrator's teachers played an essential role in facilitating their understanding by translating the guide's words. This enabled the narrator to grasp the importance and meaning behind the different tombstones and memorials, deepening their emotional connection to the cemetery and those buried there. 4.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Bob Clampett's 'An Itch in Time' milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching. The cartoon switches between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope with it. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can't be scratched, the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid! It sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only Clampett could. There are several other elements which make 'An Itch in Time' pure Clampett. There's the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh. There's the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat. Most notably, there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog's behind which causes the flea to wolf-whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor. He momentarily breaks off to address the audience: \\"Hey, I better cut this out. I may get to like it\\"! With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique, minutiae-based cartoon. Like an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is practically about nothing but very funny with it.

What I received is words to read and a voice reading the words.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","output":"This review portrays the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer, being a teacher, expected a movie or animation to accompany the Bible stories and assist them in teaching. However, the product delivered did not meet these expectations. Instead, it only provided the text and a voice reading the words, which was not what the reviewer was looking for. The main reason why this review can be considered unflattering is that it highlights a lack of clarity in the product description. The fact that the reviewer had to point out the absence of a crucial feature in the product description suggests there might have been some miscommunication or inadequate information provided about the product. As a result, the reviewer's experience with the product was not satisfactory, and they found it necessary to share their disappointment with potential customers. Furthermore, the reviewer seems to imply that the product is not suited for their specific needs, which might be an important factor for other potential customers in making a decision to purchase the product. The lack of visual aids in the form of movies or animations may discourage other teachers or people looking for similar resources from considering this particular product. In summary, the review depicts the product in an unflattering light due to the unmet expectations of the reviewer, the lack of clear information in the product description, and the absence of a crucial feature (movies or animations) required by the target audience.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.  and the situation: Bob was studying about Earth's atmosphere.

In the early twentieth century ozone layer was relatively stable. Bob labeled that time as time A. But in the late twentieth century situation changed with seasonal depletion of ozone layer.

Step 1: Understand the background information According to the background, the increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has led to a reduction in marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15%.

Bob has labeled two different time periods: Time A representing the early twentieth century when the ozone layer was relatively stable, and Time B representing the late twentieth century, which saw seasonal depletion of the ozone layer. Step 3: Determine the phytoplankton levels at each time period As mentioned in the background information, increased solar ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion in time B has reduced phytoplankton by as much as 15%. Since the ozone layer was relatively stable in time A, it can be inferred that the phytoplankton levels were higher during this period. Step 4: Answer the question based on the gathered information Given that marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) was reduced by 15% during time B due to ozone depletion, it can be concluded that time A would see more phytoplankton since the ozone layer was relatively stable during that time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. William Turvill. Warrant: Andrew Rutter, who has been sentenced to six and a half years in jail for shaking his baby, is on the run. A father who violently shook his baby because he wouldn’t stop crying went on the run part-way through his trial, which saw him sentenced to six and a half years in prison. Andrew Rutter, 28, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, disappeared as evidence mounted against him over his cruelty to his son, Jacob. His trial, at Bolton Crown Court, continued in his absence after he went missing on Tuesday, and, after sentencing him, the judge issued a warrant for his arrest. While babysitting for the seven-month-old, Rutter sent a series of desperate text messages to the infant’s mother, Samantha Harper, 22, who was at work. ‘He is doing my head in, he won’t stop screaming,’ he wrote. ‘I can’t handle him,’ he said in a second message. And a third read: ‘If you keep being soft with him I’ll never have him again.’ The alarm was raised after Rutter sent a fourth text saying: ‘He can’t open his eyes, he’s gone all floppy.’ This was followed up with the message: ‘He won’t wake up - I’m getting worried now.’ Ms Harper called the out-of-hours doctors service for advice but the baby’s health deteriorated and he was taken to a walk-in centre. Staff examined him and called an ambulance to take him to hospital where was found to have been shaken so violently he suffered a bleed to his brain. Scans showed the youngster had suffered a subdural hematoma and he had to spend more than a month in hospital. Now two years old, Jacob is currently living with his grandparents and, despite his injuries, is not thought to have suffered any long-term problems. Rutter, who had been on bail, turned up for the start of his trial on January 20. But he failed to appear on Tuesday after the prosecution finished its case against him - and he has not been seen since. On Thursday a jury - who heard the incident was a ‘moment of madness’ - convicted Rutter in his absence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and cruelty to a child by wilful neglect. Texts: Rutter, from Walkden, Greater Manchester, went missing part-way through his trial at Bolton Crown. He sent a series of desperate text messages to the infant's mother, Samantha Harper, while babysitting. Today, Rutter was the subject of a. police man-hunt after Judge Timothy Clayson issued a warrant for his. arrest and said he would face six years and six months jail when he is. captured. Judge Clayson said: ‘The defendant had become increasingly frustrated with Jacob. ‘Medical. evidence in the case indicates that Jacob was significantly subjected. to a violent shaking that resulted in a serious injury to his brain.’ He added: ‘There is a trail of evidence via text messages that demonstrates what happened. ‘The. defendant didn’t take any steps to summon any medical help. He didn’t. reveal what he had done to his girlfriend. Samantha did contact the. walk-in centre but was not in a position to say what had happened. ‘The next day the baby was taken to a medical centre and then the hospital and received treatment some weeks thereafter. Judge Timothy Clayson sentenced Rutter to prison after the trial continued in his absence this week. ‘There is no up-to-date progress but his grandparents seem to be positive and it’s to be hoped that there are no serious long term problems.’ The incident occurred on May 13 2012 while Rutter, who has 22 previous convictions, but none relating to violence, was alone with Jacob. He became ‘frustrated’ with his son’s crying. Prosecutor Rob Hall said of the text messages: ‘It indicates that Rutter shook him in a manner that is beyond anything appropriate and then knowing what he had done, failed to do anything to assist the child in getting any sort of care. ‘These are the type of messages you might get from a parent who was losing their self-control and displaying increasing anger.’ Defence counsel Wayne Jackson, said: ‘While I concede there was a shaking injury at some point, I say the evidence does not support any shaking on the day in question.’ Ms Harper was cleared of child neglect at an earlier hearing after the prosecution discontinued proceedings against her. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"A man named Andrew Rutter shook his baby, Jacob, because the baby wouldn't stop crying. This hurt the baby, and he had to go to the hospital. Andrew was supposed to go to a special meeting called a trial to talk about what he did, but he left in the middle of it. The people in charge of the trial decided that Andrew should go to jail, but they have to find him first. The baby, Jacob, is now living with his grandparents, and might be okay even though he got hurt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Can you speak to dolphins? Of course you can but you won't be able to understand them! We interviewed a biologist and asked her what research on dolphin communication has shown. This is what she told us. Just like dogs, cats and other mammals, dolphins communicate by using sound, vision  , touch and taste. Each dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself and to call others. Dolphins don't have the ability to smell, but their hearing and eyesight are excellent. We also asked Jane if dolphins have got their own language. She told us that they have and that dolphins started talking to each other from birth. They make different sounds, including whistles, squeaks and click. Sometimes they even sound like a heavy metal band! We then asked Jane if any interesting experiments have been done. She told us that a very interesting experiment had been done with a mother dolphin and her two-year-old baby in an aquarium. They talked to each other over the telephone! The two dolphins were in separate tanks which were connected by a special under water system. Unfortunately the biologists couldn't understand what the dolphins were talking about because they haven't been able to decode   dolphin language yet. However, it was very clear that the dolphins knew what they were talking about. Finally we asked Jane if there was hope that we would be able to understand dolphins in the near future. She told us that she and her team have been listening to dolphins for more than 17 years, using special equipment to record and analyze their language. Unfortunately they haven't been able to decode it yet, but who knows -- maybe one day we'll get a phone call from a dolphin. Answer:","output":"Which method did researchers use to observe dolphin communication in an experiment mentioned in the article? A. Studying their body language from a distance B.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 84 Days to Decide: Democrats Roll Dice With Education Aid Vote House Democrats are rolling the dice Tuesday after returning from a recess that had barely begun to pass a 26 billion teacher jobs bill -- at a time when calls for fiscal restraint are dominating the campaign landscape. Democrats and Obama administration officials say the package is paid for and will not add to the deficit. The bill, which is expected to pass, allows supporters to tout their role in saving tens of thousands of teachers and other government workers from being laid off before the start of the school year, and before the November election. \\"This bill ... will help keep 160,000 teachers around the country in the classroom as we start school the next couple weeks rather than on the unemployment line,\\" Education Secretary Arne Duncan told Fox News on Monday. But at the same time, the vote takes members of Congress off the campaign trail to vote for yet another multibillion-dollar aid bill. And Republicans are not missing the opportunity to cite the looming vote as the latest example of Washington's addiction to spending -- something they claim they'll cure should they win back the majority in Congress. \\"It amounts at this point in time to asking the citizens of responsible states like ours to subsidize those places who have been more reckless,\\" Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"It's probably not going to help the economy.\\" He described the continuing stream of state aid as a form of \\"trickle-down government\\" that is not spurring private job growth. The bill is paid for with a cut to food stamps benefits and a tax increase on some multinational companies based in the United States. House Minority Leader John Boehner cited the provisions in claiming the jobs bill would have an adverse effect. Boehner said the vote just shows how oblivious Democrats are to concerns about spending. \\"The American people don't want more Washington 'stimulus' spending -- especially in the form of a payoff to union bosses and liberal special interests,\\" he said in a statement last week. \\"This stunning display of tone-deafness comes at the expense of American workers, who will be hit by another job-killing tax hike because Washington Democrats can't kick their addiction to more government 'stimulus' spending. Democrats should be listening to their constituents.\\" Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, whose state reportedly is set to receive 250 million in education money from the bill, said that some of the \\"stimulus funding\\" has helped, but eventually it has to stop. \\"I think it has to end soon because the federal government is running out of money,\\" he said on CNN's \\"State of the Union.\\" \\"We cannot continue to have all of the states rely on the federal government.\\" Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, though, said that while the states do need to make cuts, the funding in the 26 billion package is necessary. \\"This is not for bureaucracy. This is for people -- real people who need real help out here. And this bill was entirely funded,\\" she said. The state with the most to gain from the bill is California, set to receive 1.2 billion for education. The amount is projected to save up to 16,500 teacher jobs. With California and other states still struggling to close gaping budget shortfalls, many lawmakers welcomed the congressional package. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a written statement that the money comes \\"just in time\\" for the start of the school year. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called lawmakers back to Washington last week after the Senate broke a GOP filibuster that paved the way for the bill's passage -- just days after the House went on recess. The bill is meant to provide both teacher and Medicaid funding to the states. Summary:","output":"House Democrats want to pass a 26 billion bill to help save teacher jobs when school starts. They say it won't add to the country's money problems because it is already paid for. Some people think this is a good idea to help teachers and schools, while others think it's just spending more money that we don't have and not helping the economy. The money for this bill comes from cutting food stamp benefits and increasing taxes on some big companies. Some states like California would get a lot of money from this bill to save teacher jobs, while other people think we should stop relying on the government for money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which scientist read less about aphid honeydew?  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. A:","output":"Based on the given information, Ellie read less about aphid honeydew. Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.

Can you tell me the answer to when did world war 2 in the pacific end??","output":"World War II in the Pacific came to an end on September 2, 1945, following the official surrender of the Empire of Japan. This conclusion brought about the end of a brutal conflict that had lasted for six years and cost countless lives. The Pacific theater of World War II was a significant part of the broader global conflict that occurred between 1939 and 1945, pitting the Allies, primarily the United States, the British Commonwealth, and the Republic of China, against the Axis powers, led in the Pacific by the Empire of Japan. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, brought the United States into the war and marked the beginning of open hostilities between the two nations. Over the course of the following years, the war in the Pacific saw numerous hard-fought battles, including the Battle of Midway (June 1942), the Battle of Guadalcanal (August 1942 - February 1943), the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 1944), and the Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 1944). As the tide of war turned against Japan, the United States and its allies engaged in a concerted island-hopping campaign to reclaim Japanese-held territory and establish a foothold closer to the Japanese mainland. This campaign included the Battle of Iwo Jima (February - March 1945) and the Battle of Okinawa (April - June 1945), each characterized by intense and bloody fighting. With Japan increasingly pressed by the advancing Allies, the nation's leaders still showed little inclination to surrender. However, this calculus shifted with the dropping of atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) by the United States. These bombings, coupled with the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan on August 8, 1945, ultimately led to the Japanese decision to capitulate. Emperor Hirohito announced the acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, which called for Japan's unconditional surrender, in a radio address on August 15, 1945. This day became known as Victory over Japan Day (V-J Day) and signaled the end of World War II in the Pacific. However, it was not until September 2, 1945, that the formal surrender was signed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, presided over by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur, thereby conclusively ending World War II in the Pacific."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Question: Barend was: Answer: Options are:  A). handsom kid  B). boring looking kid  C). not enough information  D). smart kid The answer is:","output":"B). boring looking kid"},{"instruction":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When I was seven years old, my family made me an ant farm. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box. Then we waited for the ants to arrive. After the ants were in the glass farm, they started to make tunnels . I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. Each had its own job. On the fifth day a tragedy  happened. I put my face so close to the glass farm that I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of sadness. They simply could not stand that their tunnels were gone. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about the natural world, but it taught me much more. Over the years, I came to realize the importance of teamwork. Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently: Adversity  is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, we cannot give up when we are sad. We have to realize that if a tunnel is gone, we must build another. Giving up, I say, is not a good choice. Question: What did the writer learn from the ant tragedy a few years later?

Write an article based on this summary: A man died after being given an antibiotic containing penicillin, an inquest heard.","output":"Title: Inquest Reveals Tragic Death After Administration of Penicillin-Containing Antibiotic Introduction A recent inquest held in the local court revealed that a man passed away due to a fatal reaction caused by the administration of an antibiotic containing penicillin. This tragic incident highlights the importance of careful assessment and proper medication management by healthcare professionals as well as increased awareness among patients about potential allergies and their consequences. Step 1: Investigation of the Incident The inquest was initiated to determine the cause of death and to investigate if there was any negligence on the part of the attending medical practitioners. It involved consultations with several experts, a thorough examination of the medical records, and testimonies from the involved healthcare staff. This allowed the court to gather a comprehensive understanding of the sequence of events leading up to the man's untimely demise. Step 2: Findings of the Inquest It was during the course of the inquest that it was discovered that the man had been administered an antibiotic containing penicillin, which ultimately led to his fatal reaction. Penicillin is a common component of various antibiotics, and though being critical in treating bacterial infections, it may cause severe reactions to patients with a penicillin allergy. In this case, the patient's allergy to penicillin was/is unknown or undocumented. Step 3: Analysis of the Healthcare System's Role The inquest highlights a significant issue within the healthcare system: the protocols surrounding patient assessment, history-taking, and documentation. Ensuring that healthcare professionals are well-equipped to identify and avoid administering medication with potentially fatal consequences for patients with allergies is crucial for preventing similar incidents in the future. Additionally, the court investigated the need for ongoing training and awareness programs for healthcare staff to prevent similar accidents. Step 4: Public and Patient Awareness Following this unfortunate event, there is a call for increased patient awareness and advocacy. Patients must be encouraged to maintain up-to-date health records, including information regarding allergies, and communicate these details to every healthcare professional they encounter. In addition, the public must be educated about the risks associated with undisclosed allergies, particularly to medications like penicillin and other commonly prescribed antibiotics. Step 5: Conclusion and Recommendations The tragic death of the man due to the administration of an antibiotic containing penicillin emphasizes the need for heightened vigilance among healthcare providers in handling patient information and medication management. This incident serves as a reminder that medical errors can occur and that patients should be proactive in disclosing their personal health information, including allergies to medications. Recommendations derived from the inquest include: 1. Implementing robust protocols for patient assessment, history-taking, and documentation. 2. Regularly updating healthcare professionals' knowledge on potential medication allergies and their consequences. 3. Encouraging patients to maintain accurate and updated health records, including information about allergies. 4. Increasing public awareness about the importance of disclosing allergies to healthcare providers to avoid potentially fatal complications."},{"instruction":"Residents socialized, played dice, and people smoked all at the busy landing of the what?

Eight years ago, one of Europe's best-known orchestras moved their rehearsal rooms to a secondary school on this housing estate and pupils from Tenever found themselves sharing their corridors and lunch tables with professional musicians. Since then the school's results have improved, its drop-out rates have fallen to less than 1% and the atmosphere in the wider neighbourhood has been \\"transformed\\", according to Joachim Barloschky, a local official who oversaw a programme of renovation and regeneration in the area. Next month, the pupils who started at the school at the same time as the orchestra will sit their final exams. There is optimism because the number of pupils leaving school with the lowest qualifications has plummeted and the number staying on to take the Abitur exam at the end of secondary school has risen sharply. This might sound like the plot of a feelgood film. But for the pupils of Bremen East comprehensive school (known in German as GSO), the musicians of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen have become part of their daily lives. The unusual arrangement happened by accident. The orchestra was looking for a new rehearsal space at the same time that the school was being renovated. The city authorities made the connection, the builders made sure the rooms had excellent acoustics, and the orchestra moved in shortly afterwards. At first, the arrangement was not popular on either side. \\"We had thought we would move to an iconic building in the centre of the city,\\" says Stephan Schrader, a cellist in the orchestra. \\"The teachers thought the kids already did not have enough time for learning without having to skip another maths or English lesson to talk to musicians,\\" says Annette Rueggeberg, co-head teacher. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch The school and the orchestra devised a series of projects to bring musicians and students together. Musicians would visit classes to talk to pupils and once a year the musicians would help pupils and residents of Tenever to write and perform an opera. But what makes the partnership unique is the sheer volume of interactions between musicians and pupils. Whenever they are not playing, the musicians are based in the school. They sit with pupils over lunch and talk to them about their lives. Pupils are allowed to watch the orchestra rehearse, sitting between the musicians rather than in front of them as an audience. Ms Rueggeberg says: \\"Normally you only see an orchestra dressed up for a concert, but the kids mostly see them running around in jeans and find them very approachable. It has broken down the barriers.\\" The improving results and the presence of the orchestra have changed people's opinions. \\"For a very poor area where so many students come to us with German as a second language, this is really quite something,\\" says Ms Rueggeberg. \\"The whole atmosphere of the school has improved and we no longer have such problems with fighting or aggression or graffiti.\\" Students from all over Bremen now want to join the school. \\"In the past you could not imagine pupils travelling from well-off parts of Bremen to a very poor area but now we have to turn them away because we do not have enough space. We have become the most popular school in the city.\\" The orchestra has helped to remove the stigma attached to the neighbourhood surrounding the school, says the former district manager Joachim Barloschky. \\"People used to say about Tenever, 'Don't go there, they are poor, they are from different countries, many of them are criminals,'\\" says Mr Barloschky. \\"Now we are known as the district that has the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and everyone has more self-confidence.\\" \\"After one community opera, a child ran up to me and asked: 'Did you see the people coming all the way from Hamburg to see us in a very big Maserati?' They are no longer ashamed of where they come from but proud of their school and their district.\\" Is there something special about music that has led to these improvements? Research has suggested links between music education and improved reading comprehension, language development, IQ scores and creative skills. \\"While other activities can be beneficial, music seems to have a wider range of benefits,\\" says Professor Susan Hallam at UCL Institute of Education. The pupils also benefit from encountering people from the unfamiliar background of classical music. Max Haimendorf, head of secondary at King Solomon Academy in central London, says his school has improved since it became compulsory for every pupil to play in an orchestra. \\"By performing at places like the Barbican and working with people from a classical instrument background, the knock-on conversations, opportunities and experiences our pupils get has really broadened their perspectives,\\" he says. But the orchestra in Bremen plays down the role of music. There are many music education schemes that teach pupils for a week or invite them to a special concert, says Lea Fink, who runs the education programme for the orchestra. \\"But the value of our project lies in the long and persistent groundwork and the feeling of trust that has developed between the children and the musicians.\\" \\"We do not try to be music teachers, but we let them see that we are normal people,\\" says Mr Schrader. \\"I ask students about their families and tell them about mine. \\"When they have a problem, I know about it. I am not the one who will find the solution, but I am one more adult person they have contact with.\\" So should other top orchestras, cultural organisations or even sports teams consider moving into a school? Mr Schrader thinks so. \\"The experience has actually improved us as an orchestra,\\" he says. \\"When the children sit between us at rehearsals, our concentration is better. We can actually see their eyes grow wide with excitement when we play certain chords or play quickly. \\"It reminds us of the reason we make music, which is sometimes easy to forget.\\" Summary:","output":"The relocation of a well-known orchestra to a secondary school in a housing estate in Bremen, Germany, transformed the school's performance and atmosphere, reducing dropout rates and increasing the number of pupils taking higher level exams."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Who ate the cake?

He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan's Theater District, he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend Maria. After a disastrous fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic functions one by one. As the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelgÃ¤ngers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy's lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy's interest in Hazel sparks...

One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits. He used the basket A fruits to make some candied fruits, but was too lazy to use the basket B fruits. He just kept the basket B fruits on his kitchen top.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will basket A fruits be preserved or get spoiled?  Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] A:","output":"Basket A fruits will be preserved. Since Greg used the fruits from basket A to make candied fruits, the process of placing the fruits in heated sugar syrup will absorb the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserve it.

We have this problem: 1758*q - 36*q - 13284 = 246*q Now we'll find all the pieces with a 'q' in them so we can put them together. We have 1758*q, -36*q on the left side, and 246*q on the right side. Let's move the -36*q to the right side. Since it's -36*q, we'll add 36*q to both sides to cancel it out: 1758*q - 36*q + 36*q - 13284 = 246*q + 36*q That gives us: 1758*q - 13284 = 282*q Now, let's put all the q's together. We want to move the 282*q from the right side to the left side. To do that, we'll subtract 282*q from both sides: 1758*q - 282*q - 13284 = 282*q - 282*q Our new problem looks like this: 1476*q - 13284 = 0 Now, we're going to find q by itself. So, we're going to divide both sides by 1476: (1476*q - 13284) / 1476 = 0 / 1476 This simplifies to: q - 9 = 0 Almost there! We just need to get q by itself. To do that, we'll add 9 to both sides: q - 9 + 9 = 0 + 9 And that gives us: q = 9 So, the answer to the puzzle is q = 9.

The paragraph provides details about his role as a Nigerian traditional ruler and politician, his ascension to the position of Emir of Borgu, and his term until his death in 2015, but it does not offer any insight into his character, leadership qualities, or the opinion of the people who were under his rule. To evaluate the hypothesis accurately, we would need to consider additional information, such as accounts from people who were close to him or impacted by his rule, historical records that offer insight into his leadership style and accomplishments, and reactions to his death from the community he served and the general public. Factors that might contribute to the perception of him being well-loved could include his commitment to improving the lives of his people, his involvement in charitable work or social causes, his promotion of cultural and educational initiatives, or his general reputation for being a just, kind, and caring leader. On the other hand, if he was perceived as corrupt, unjust, or indifferent to the needs of his people, the hypothesis would likely not hold true.

His 22-year-old daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams), returns home from Europe, announcing that she is engaged to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), a man from an upper-class family from Bel-Air, despite them only having known each other for three months. The sudden shock turns the warm reunion into a heated argument between George and Annie, but they quickly reconcile in time for Bryan to arrive and meet them. Despite Bryan's good financial status and likeable demeanour, George takes an immediate dislike to him while his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), accepts him as a potential son-in-law. George and Nina meet Bryan's parents, John and Joanna MacKenzie. Though George feels comfort from John also expressing how shocked he had initially been at Bryan's engagement, he quickly gets into trouble when he begins nosing around and eventually ends up falling into the pool when cornered by the MacKenzies' vicious pet Dobermans.

The plan was announced by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro on 1 May as a way of bringing the country together but opposition politicians have denounced it as a \\"fraud\\" and a way to further delay overdue gubernatorial elections.

News article: U.S., BONN AND JAPAN END SYNTHETIC FUEL PLAN The United States, West Germany and Japan agreed yesterday to abandon a cooperative 1.55 billion coal liquefaction project that less than a year ago was hailed by Department of Energy officials as a centerpiece of the nation's drive to reduce dependence on imported oil. The synthetic fuel plant, which was to have been built in Morgantown, W.Va., was to have converted 6,000 tons of high-sulfur coal into 20,000 barrels of oil and gas daily using a process developed by the Gulf Oil Company. Gulf joined with a Japanese consortium led by Mitsui and Ruhrkohle A.G. of West Germany to form SRC International Inc., a venture that was to have provided 100 million for the project and served as prime contractor. The Governments of West Germany and Japan each agreed to cover 25 percent of the costs, and the United States was to pay the remaining 50 percent. ''This is a precursor of wonderful things to come,'' President Carter said, as the Ambassadors of West Germany and Japan looked on during the signing of the agreement in the Rose Garden last July 31. The decision to cut off the Government subsidies, thus effectively killing the project, came after two days of meetings in Bonn. It had been considered inevitable by many experts on synthetic fuels. West Germany began expressing doubts last December about continuing its participation in view of rising costs. The original cost estimate had grown from 750 million, to 1.4 billion, by last summer. Early this year, Energy Department officials began using 1.55 billion as the figure. More important than the West German qualms, however, was the proposal this spring by the Reagan Administration to shift virtually all financing of synthetic fuels programs to the private sector as part of its economic recovery program. No funds for the project were included in the fiscal year 1982 budget that is now before Congress. U.S. Proposed Cancellation A communique published by the West German Ministry for Research and Technology at the end of the meetings yesterday said that alternatives, including reducing the size of the project, had been considered. After a cost-benefit analysis of the alternatives, the American delegation had proposed ending the project, and the West Germans agreed, the statement said. In Washington, an Energy Department spokesman said that the size reduction considered would have halved the amount of coal put through the process daily, but that Gulf's feasibility study indicated it would not have come close to halving costs. The three nations also considered and rejected the idea of paying about 70 million to continue design work for two more years, she said. The decision to kill the project disappointed the Japanese, who have been hoping to develop technologies to exploit vast coal deposits in Australia and China. They also viewed the cooperative effort as symbolically important. In Pittsburgh, a Gulf spokesman noted that the Governments had not questioned th technical feasibility of the solvent refined coal process, known as SRC-2 to distinguish it from another coal liquefaction process developed by Air Products and Chemicals Inc. and Wheelabrator-Frye Inc. 'Examine Ways to Continue' ''We will examine ways to continue development of the technology with our partners in SRC International,'' the Gulf spokesman said. ''Until we are notified, we don't know how or when the project will end, but I would expect productive activity to halt quickly.'' That activity included design work that has cost SRC International 35 million, according to a Gulf spokesman, and the Department of Energy about 100 million, according to a department spokesman. The West Germans and Japanese have paid a total of 28 million, but that money has not been spent and may be returned, the Energy Department said. Termination expenses should be about 16 million. At the time the financing agreement was signed, the SRC-2 project was thought to be the most ambitious international energy project ever. Yesterday's announcement said that the three Governments felt that some benefits had been derived from the cooperative effort and that opportunities for other joint projects would be sought. The process developed by Gulf operates at higher temperatures and pressures than the SRC-1 process in order to produce various liquids than can be used in place of oil. The SRC-1 process produces some liquid, as well as desulfurized, low-ash coal that can replace oil in utility boilers without adding expensive air pollution equipment. The SRC-1 project, scheduled to be built in Newman, Ky. and on line in 1985, is now estimated to cost 1.72 billion. It, like the SRC-2 project, did not receive funding in the proposed Reagan budget. But backers managed to get 135 million, which had not been spent this year, carried over for work next year. ''I don't think you can expect any impact on SRC-1 from the decision to kill SRC-2,'' said a spokesman for the International Coal Refining Company, the partnership set up by Air Products and Wheelabrator-Frye, from Air Products' Allentown, Pa., headquarters. ''The initials are the same, and that's about it.'' International Coal is to spend 90 million on the SRC-1 project. The State of Kentucky is contributing 30 million, and the Federal Government is scheduled to pay the rest.

Mark wants to go mountain climbing while Jordan wants to go to a concert out of state. Jordan sometimes has a hard time breathing as well so they take this into consideration while making the plans for their trip.  and a hint : As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.  Please answer this question : Will there be more oxygen in the air at the top of the mountain or at the concert? The answer to this question is:","output":"There will be more oxygen in the air at the concert location compared to the top of the mountain. As the hint provided explains, air pressure and oxygen levels decrease as altitude increases. At higher altitudes, such as those found on mountain tops, there is a significant reduction in oxygen concentration due to the decrease in air pressure and air density. This often results in the feeling of being harder to breathe for individuals who are not accustomed to high altitude environments. On the other hand, the concert location, which is out of state and presumably at a lower altitude, will have higher air pressure and density, resulting in a greater concentration of oxygen in the air. This environment will be more comfortable for breathing, especially for someone like Jordan, who sometimes experiences breathing difficulties. Therefore, in terms of oxygen levels, it would be more suitable for Mark and Jordan to prioritize attending the concert as it provides a more comfortable environment concerning oxygen availability for breathing. They should also consider Jordan's breathing difficulties in planning their activities and ensure proper measures are taken to address those health concerns on their trip."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nieuwendyk reached two offensive milestones in 2002-03. He scored his 500th career goal on January 17, 2003, against Carolina's Kevin Weekes. On February 23, he scored his 1,000th point in a win over the Pittsburgh Penguins. He and the Devils reached the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, but Nieuwendyk suffered a hip injury in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference Final that prevented him from appearing in the championship series. The Devils defeated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the final, capturing the franchise's third Stanley Cup. For Nieuwendyk, it was his third title with his third different team.  The Toronto Maple Leafs signed Nieuwendyk to a one-year contract for the 2003-04 season. He scored 22 goals for Toronto in a season marred by abdominal and back injuries that limited him to 64 games played, and a groin injury that forced him out of the lineup for much of Toronto's second-round series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. He signed another one-year deal for 2004-05, but the season was cancelled due to a labour dispute that was feared would mark the end of the 38-year-old Nieuwendyk's career.  When NHL play resumed in 2005-06, the Florida Panthers sought to bolster their lineup with veteran players. They signed both Nieuwendyk and Roberts, who had played together in Calgary and Toronto and wanted to finish their careers together, to two-year, 4.5 million contracts. Nieuwendyk appeared in 65 games during the season, scoring 26 goals and 56 points. He appeared in 15 games in 2006-07 before chronic back pain forced him onto injured reserve. After missing 14 games, Nieuwendyk announced his retirement on December 7, 2006. Answer this question \\"/what happened in new jersey?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"In New Jersey, Joe Nieuwendyk played for the Devils during their playoff run in 2002. He scored 11 points in 14 regular-season games after being acquired for their playoff run. Despite this, the Devils were eliminated in the first round of the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs by the Carolina Hurricanes. Nieuwendyk went on to reach milestones like scoring his 500th career goal and his 1,000th point during the 2002-03 season. In the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, he suffered a hip injury that prevented him from appearing in the championship series, but the Devils still won the Stanley Cup, making it Nieuwendyk's third title with his third different team."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What are people more likely to do when they drink alcohol at a bar?

To provide a detailed answer, let's first break down the given premise: \\"Specifically, we relied on national saving data for the G-7 nations - Canada, France, Germany, Italy.\\" This statement informs us that national saving data was used for four of the G-7 countries (which also include Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in some kind of analysis or study. The G-7 is a group of seven large industrialized nations that work together on global economic issues. The hypothesis posed is: \\"National saving data for France and Canada were equally considered.\\" This statement suggests that France and Canada received equal consideration regarding their national saving data, meaning that the same weight was given to the data from both countries. Given the available choices, we can analyze each one: (I). Yes - This answer implies that the premise directly confirms the hypothesis that France and Canada's data were equally considered. However, the premise only states that the data was relied on for the G-7 nations; it does not provide any clear indication of how the data was weighted or considered. (II). It is not possible to tell - This answer recognizes that there is not enough information from the premise to determine if the hypothesis is true. The premise states that saving data for the four G-7 nations were used, but it does not detail how the data was treated or considered in the analysis. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude whether France and Canada's data received equal consideration. (III). No - This answer suggests that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, meaning France and Canada's data were not equally considered. However, this conclusion is also not supported by the premise, as it doesn't provide enough information to make this determination. Hence, the most appropriate answer is (II).

Ray's friend, Marty, a lively accountant, accidentally stumbles onto a secret financial heist plan by Ray and his gang, leading to a conflict between the two. Marty, naive and idealistic, believes in justice and decides to expose Ray. However, Ray catches wind of his plans and decides Marty is a liability that needs to be dealt with urgently. The news rattles the city's underworld, causing panic among those who once called Marty, essentially a pacifist, their friend. Ray's power and influence make Marty's life unbearable. Perceiving that his end is near, Marty leaves behind several cryptic clues, hoping his journalist wife, Sarah, would uncover the truth if something happened to him. Unable to escape the city in time, Marty is captured by Ray's henchmen. Ray, showcasing his brute force and lack of empathy, decides to bury Marty alive as a warning to anyone who dared to cross him in the future. Marty is taken to a remote location and buried under the sand, left with nothing but a walkie-talkie to communicate his final words. The second act begins with Sarah, embarking on a relentless pursuit to find her missing husband. She deciphers Marty's clues which lead her to Ray's heinous plan. Realizing the desperate situation, she engages a retired cop, Daniel, who has personal grudges with Ray and the system that failed to imprison him. Daniel, Sarah, and a team of other supporting characters are against the clock to find Marty. They pursue multiple leads, confront Ray's gang members, and go through a rollercoaster of emotions and action-packed chases and fights. Meanwhile, Marty clings to life underneath the sand, communicating through the walkie-talkie with them, providing valuable information about his location. Ray, upon learning Sarah's intentions, becomes hell-bent on stopping her, leading to a thrilling climax. Sarah, driven by the need to save her husband, and Daniel, powered by his urge to serve justice, stand firm against Ray and his gang. The ultimate climax leads to a location where a fierce fight ensues between Ray's gang and the rescue team. Daniel fights off the henchmen, while Sarah frantically digs through the sand searching for Marty. The final moments of the film are nail-biting as breathless Marty's voice fades on the walkie-talkie while Ray and Daniel engage in a final showdown. In the end, Sarah manages to find and dig out Marty, just as Daniel takes down Ray, offering viewers a relief-filled, emotional ending. Post-credits depict Ray's criminal empire crumbling down, and Marty, now a whistleblower, helps bring justice to others wronged by Ray's operations. Daniel and Sarah form a special bond based on shared experiences, while the city begins to recover from the darkness of Ray's reign. \\"Under the Sand: Marty's Survival\\" becomes a thrilling rollercoaster, blending elements of crime, action, suspense, and a tale of love against odds, testing the characters' strength, resilience, and faith."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"What rank was Owen at what he did?\\" is in \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

Both the girls' and boys' teams emerged victorious, with the girls' team winning 61-25 and the boys' team winning 59-37 at the home court of the Denver Nuggets. The passage also mentions that MCHS seniors Jana Camilletti and Brent Cook were awarded MVP honors and the game ball.

Therefore, it would be incorrect to infer that the Bulldogs' girls' team had not won any games before this particular match against Aspen Skiers. In fact, the passage states that the Bulldog girls \\"won handily in their first face-off against a 3A Western Slope League school,\\" which suggests that they were able to secure a comfortable victory against their opponent. This could potentially imply that the team has had previous successes in their games, even if those matches were not against a 3A Western Slope League school.

They can supply human activities forever. Fossil fuels are crucial for modern human society. Fossil fuels are essential for transportation, industry and agriculture. Renewable energy resources tend to be clean. They emit fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Renewable resources often have other problems. They are more costly and less efficient than fossil fuels. Still, they have many advantages. Research is going into developing renewable resources. Conservation is the best way to increase resource availability. Anyone can conserve! You and your family can. Society can. The world can. Just reduce, reuse, recycle.

Some might not want to admit it, but there is a hidden Cinderella in everyone's heart--we all wish we could achieve recognition or success after a period of obscurity .  Mary Santiago has that secret dream, too. Her story is featured in Another Cinderella Story, a film set in a US high school.  Mary is shy but loves to dance. Compared with other girls, she is invisible. However, her world changes completely when a famous teenager pop singer, Joey Parker, appears.  Joey is everything the rest of the boys in her class are not--kind, handsome and desirable. Mary and Joey's paths cross at a ball. They meet and fall in love with each other. But when Mary has to rush back home, she leaves behind her MP3 player, which becomes the only clue Joey has to find the girl of his dreams. Of course, there is a wicked stepmother, who turns out to be Dominique Blatt and she takes in Mary after her dancer mother dies. Dominique treats Mary like a maid and does everything she can to make sure Mary doesn't get into the top dance school. Her two daughters are equally determined to stop Joey falling for Mary, even if that means embarrassing her.

What is the answer: In which Hitchcock film did Ingrid Bergman play Dr Constance Peterson and Gregory Peck play Dr Anthony Edwards?","output":"The Hitchcock film in which Ingrid Bergman played Dr. Constance Petersen and Gregory Peek played Dr. Anthony Edwardes is \\"Spellbound\\". This iconic thriller was first released in 1945 and has since become known as one of the classic works of the legendary director Alfred Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock was an ace in the domain of suspense and psychological thrillers, and \\"Spellbound\\" is a testament to his cinematic genius. \\"Spellbound\\" was considered groundbreaking for its time for its use of psychoanalysis and for its inclusion of a dream sequence designed by the famous artist Salvador Dalí. In this film, the radiant Ingrid Bergman plays the role of Dr. Constance Petersen, a dedicated psychoanalyst who falls in love with her new boss, Dr. Anthony Edwardes, portrayed by the charming Gregory Peck. The narrative unravels in a series of twists and turns as it is revealed that Edwardes is in fact an impostor. He is suffering from amnesia and Petersen, driven by her professional responsibilities as well as her feelings for him, takes it upon herself to cure his condition and discover his true identity, believing in his innocence even when he's suspected of murder. It's a gripping narrative of love, identity, and duty, filled with suspense and intrigue, true to Hitchcock’s style. The leading performances are captivating; Bergman shines as the resolute and intelligent Dr. Petersen, while Peck ably portrays the tortured and confused Edwardes, making \\"Spellbound\\" a riveting watch.  Another aspect that sets \\"Spellbound\\" apart is its focus on mental health and psychoanalysis, a territory not typically explored in detail in films of that era. The movie was an attempt to familiarize the audience with the work of psychoanalysts and the mental struggle of their patients, albeit with a dramatic turn. To sum it up, in \\"Spellbound\\", Ingrid Bergman decorated the screen as the vibrant and determined Dr. Constance Petersen with Gregory Peck complimenting superbly as Dr. Anthony Edwardes. The film remains one of Hitchcock's most celebrated works, a perfect blend of mystery, romance, and psychological tension. It continues to be revered for its performances, its exploration of psychoanalysis, and, of course, for its impressively orchestrated suspense."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Cornerback Bashaud Breeland was one of seven Redskins players listed as a limited participant during Wednesday’s practice. He returned to the practice field for the first time since suffering a right ankle injury in Week 3 against the New York Giants. Breeland said the ankle was stiff, but he didn’t experience any pain during practice. He doesn’t think it’s enough to impact his play however. He has been sidelined the past two games because of the injury, and Breeland said he’s itching to get back on the field. “It feels like I ain’t played in five games,” Breeland said. “You know [with the way] I started the season, I’m just ready to go ahead and turn the hat over.” He received some negative tweets from Redskins fans after celebrating Washington’s victory on Sunday over the Baltimore Ravens. Breeland responded and said he “wanted to be the villain at that point in time” because of criticism after a win. His season got off to a rough start after an impressive training camp. Breeland recorded an interception in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he allowed two touchdowns to wide receiver Antonio Brown on plays that could’ve resulted in takeaways. It spiraled down from there as questions arose about why the Redskins didn’t use cornerback Josh Norman to trail Brown. During the second half of Washington’s game against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 2, defensive coordinator Joe Barry made the switch to have Norman trail wide receiver Dez Bryant during the fourth quarter. these so call redskins fans need to stop wasting their breathe talking to me like im a slouch check ur history real talk #HTTR — Bashaud Breeland (@Salute_me17) October 10, 2016 “To me, I feel like I’m one of those players where I know I messed up,” Breeland said. “I know I’ve played bad, and I critique myself. I feel like Redskins fans, they should know me as a player being here for three years. They shouldn’t have to keep telling me I played bad even though my team winning. It’s a new start. It’s a fresh week. You don’t have to keep relaying that to me. I know that. “Those plays lost us the game, and I know that. I don’t fault them for what they’re saying. But them knowing me, and if you’re a real Redskins fan and you know me, then you should know that I’m always going to bounce back. That was my only issue. It don’t bother me when they say that.” Breeland hasn’t had a chance to redeem himself because of the injury he suffered during the Giants game. He said he wanted to show Redskins fans in his tweets that his confidence hasn’t been shot despite the slow start. “I feel good,” Breeland said when asked if he’ll play on Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles. “I feel confident that I’m capable of playing. The decision is up to my coaches. Everything else is out of my control.” Along with Breeland, inside linebacker Su’a Cravens (concussion), cornerback Dashaun Phillips (hamstring), outside linebacker Trent Murphy (shoulder), left tackle Trent Williams (knee), defensive end Chris Baker (foot) and Norman (wrist) were all also limited. Redskins wide receiver Josh Doctson (Achilles’ tendon) and tight end Jordan Reed (evaluated for a concussion) were the only two players to miss practice.

I. make a roux; II. make a salad dressing; Answer:","output":"The best way to create a base for sauces depends on the desired outcome and the specific type of sauce you want to make. Both making a roux and making a salad dressing have their own advantages and best practices, which are described below. I. Make a Roux: A roux is a classic French technique used as a thickening agent for sauces, soups, and stews. It is made by cooking equal parts fat (usually butter) and flour together, and it forms a smooth and stable base for various types of sauces. Here is a detailed process for making a roux: 1. Prepare your ingredients: Measure equal parts of fat and flour. The fat can be butter, oil, or rendered fat from meat like bacon. For most sauces, 2 tablespoons of fat and 2 tablespoons of flour can thicken about 2 cups of liquid.  2. Heat the fat: Melt the butter or heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Make sure the fat is fully melted and heated before adding the flour.  3. Add the flour: Slowly whisk in the flour, making sure to evenly distribute it in the fat, forming a smooth paste. Stir continuously to prevent lumps or burning.  4. Cook the roux: Keep stirring and cooking the roux for about 2-5 minutes, depending on the desired color. For a white roux, cook it for a shorter time, just until it has a pale or blond color. For a brown roux, cook it longer, allowing it to develop a darker and nuttier flavor.  5. Add liquid: Gradually whisk in the liquid (such as broth, milk, or wine) while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. The mixture will thicken as it cooks, developing a smooth and desired consistency for your sauce.  6. Season: Add your choice of spices, herbs, and additional ingredients to customize the sauce to your taste. II. Make a Salad Dressing: Salad dressings are another great option for creating a base for sauces, especially for cold or room temperature dishes. The basic components of a salad dressing include oil, an acidic ingredient (such as vinegar or lemon juice), and flavorings (such as herbs, spices, and other ingredients). Follow these steps to make a versatile salad dressing base: 1. Choose your oil: Many salad dressings use a neutral oil like extra virgin olive oil, vegetable oil, or grapeseed oil.  2. Select an acidic ingredient: Vinegar (such as balsamic, red wine, or apple cider) or citrus juice (like lemon, lime, or orange) provide a tangy and balancing flavor to the base. The standard ratio for oil to acid is 3 parts oil to 1 part acid, but you can adjust this to your taste preference. 3. Add flavorings: Customize your salad dressing base with various herbs, spices, and additional ingredients like garlic, onion, mustard, honey, or sugar. These flavorings can significantly enhance the complexity of your sauce. 4. Combine ingredients: In a jar, bowl, or blender, combine the oil, acidic ingredient, and any flavorings. Mix or blend them together until they emulsify and form a smooth, well-balanced dressing.  5. Taste and adjust: Taste your salad dressing and adjust the seasonings or ratios as needed. If it's too acidic, add more oil. If it's too oily, add more acid.  In conclusion, the best way to create a base for sauces depends on the type of sauce and your desired outcome. A roux works well for thick, heated sauces, while a salad dressing base is more appropriate for cold or room temperature dishes. With knowledge and practice for both techniques, you can master the art of making flavorful and versatile sauces for any dish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was the name of the person whose camera got smashed but his photographic film survived the impact?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues. He also claimed that the secret policemen had also... Answer:","output":"The name of the person whose camera got smashed but his photographic film survived the impact is Malcolm Browne.

Q: Passage: Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples.By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho, a small steam tug that had assisted Emma during the previous attempt. They agreed; on 25 August, Yelcho—captained by Luis Pardo–set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 a.m. on 30 August, the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.  Question: What vessel did MacDonald equip for a further rescue attempt? A:","output":"The schooner Emma"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the equation currently stands, it looks like this:    654 * a = 658 * a + 4 Next, we should attempt to move all of the terms involving 'a' to one side of the equation and all of the constants to the other side. In this case, let's work on moving the 'a' terms to one side by subtracting the '658 * a' term from both sides of the equation:    654 * a - 658 * a = 4 Now, let's simplify this further by combining the 'a' terms:   -4 * a = 4 Now, we have a simpler equation to solve for 'a'. To do this, we have to isolate the variable 'a' by dividing both sides of the equation by -4:   a = 4 / -4 Finally, simplify the expression on the right to get the value of 'a':   a = -1 Thus, the solution to the equation '654 * a = 658 * a + 4' is a = -1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johan August Strindberg (; Swedish: [2strInd,baerj] ( listen); 22 January 1849 - 14 May 1912) was a Swedish playwright, novelist, poet, essayist and painter. A prolific writer who often drew directly on his personal experience, Strindberg's career spanned four decades, during which time he wrote over sixty plays and more than thirty works of fiction, autobiography, history, cultural analysis, and politics. Strindberg died shortly after the first of his plays was staged in the United States--The Father opened on 9 April 1912 at the Berkeley Theatre in New York, in a translation by Edith and Warner Oland.  During Christmas 1911, Strindberg became sick with pneumonia and he never recovered completely. He also started to suffer from a stomach cancer. The last weeks of his life were painful, and the daily papers in Stockholm reported on his health in every edition. He received many letters and telegrams from admirers across the country. He died on 14 May 1912 at the age of 63.  Strindberg was interred at Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. He had given strict instructions concerning his funeral and how his body should be treated after death: only members of his immediate family were allowed to view his body, there would be no obduction, no photographs were taken, and no death mask was made. Strindberg had also requested that his funeral should take place as soon as possible after his death to avoid crowds of onlookers. However, the workers' organisations requested that the funeral should take place on a Sunday to make it possible for working men to pay their respects, and the funeral was postponed for five days, until Sunday, 19 May. According to Strindberg's last wish, the funeral procession was to start at 8am, again to avoid crowds, but large groups of people were nevertheless waiting outside his home as well as at the cemetery, as early as 7am. A short service was conducted by Nathan Soderblom by the bier in Strindberg's home, in the presence of three of Strindberg's children and his housekeeper, after which the coffin was taken outside for the funeral procession. The procession was followed by groups of students, workers, and members of Parliament, and it was estimated that up to 60,000 people lined the streets. King Gustaf V sent a wreath for the bier.

Article: AUGUST 7--A Google Street View car that was traveling in the wrong direction on a one-way street crashed into another vehicle last night as it attempted to make a U-turn, Arkansas police report.      The 6 PM accident on a Little Rock street left the Google car with significant damage to its front end. The other car was “fuckin’ totaled,” according to driver Dylan Case, 22, who was injured in the crash.      As seen above, the crash scene was photographed by Forbidden Hillcrest. A second photo snapped by a passing motorist shows the Google car with its front bumper missing, while the driver seems to be dismantling the vehicle’s mapping equipment      According to a Little Rock Police Department accident report, the Google-owned car, a 2010 Subaru Legacy, was being driven by Alexander Spurr, a 28-year-old Bryant, Arkansas resident. Spurr, seen at right, was cited by cops for “careless prohibited driving.”      Spurr told police that after realizing he was driving the wrong way on Tyler Street, he attempted a U-turn, but “accidently came out onto” an adjacent road, where he struck Case’s vehicle “in the side and spun him around.” Case told cops that he had a green light and that Spurr “must have ran the red light.”      Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene. Cops estimated that the Google car suffered 1500 in damages, while the Mazda will need 2000 in repairs.      Case told TSG that the Google worker “blew a red light” and slammed into his car, a 2008 Mazda owned by his girlfriend. Case, a 22-year-old construction worker, said he was headed home from work when the Google car “came out of nowhere and hits me in the side.”      The Google driver, Case recalled, “basically said he was sorry and that he was gonna lose his job.” Spurr, who did not appear injured in the crash, climbed atop his vehicle after the accident and tinkered with the high tech camera equipment mounted on the roof. Both men were traveling alone in their respective cars.      After the crash, Case sought treatment at a hospital emergency room, where he received a cat scan and X-rays. Case said that he suffered bruised ribs and whiplash in the crash and was outfitted with a neck brace at the hospital.      Case said that he expects to miss upwards of three weeks of work and is planning legal action over the accident.

The Street View car was driving the wrong way on Tyler Street, then U-turned and attempted to merge onto Cantrell Road, when it side-swiped another vehicle, a Little Rock police officer at the scene said.      The driver of the Street View car, identified as Alexander Spurr, 29, of Bryant was cited for careless or prohibited driving, according to the accident report. The estimated damaged to the Street View car was 1,500. Spurr was not injured during the crash.      The driver of the other vehicle, Dylan Case, 22, said he was \\"shaken up\\" after the crash and accused the driver of Street View car of running red light while trying to turn onto Cantrell Road.      \\"I was just coming down Cantrell in the far right lane, and the guy just blew right through the stop light and hit me,\\" Case said Thursday. \\"I spun around into the middle of the road, and I always hold the emergency brake when I'm riding and I had to pull the emergency brake or another truck would have hit me head on.\\"      Case said he later went to the emergency room for purported neck and back pain and bruised ribs. The estimated damage to Case's car was 2,000, according to the report.      \\"Something better come out of Google's pocket for this,\\" Case said.      This is not the first time a Street View car has crashed while documenting streets.

To answer this question in a step-by-step manner, we can break down the loan origination process into several steps: 1. Identify the purpose of loan origination: Loan originations involve the creation of loans for borrowers seeking funding for various purposes, such as purchasing a home, starting a business, or financing education. 2. Research and clarify loan types: Loans come in various types, including secured (backed by collateral), unsecured (not backed by collateral), fixed-rate (constant interest rate for the loan duration), and adjustable-rate loans (interest rates that fluctuate over time). 3. Explain the loan origination process: It begins with the borrower applying for a loan, either directly through a lender or via a loan officer or broker. The application typically requires the borrower to provide personal, financial, and employment information. 4. Emphasize creditworthiness assessment: Lenders assess a borrower's creditworthiness by reviewing their credit score, credit history, income, employment status, and outstanding debts. This evaluation is crucial in determining the interest rate, loan amount, and loan terms that the lender is willing to offer. 5. Describe the loan approval decision: After reviewing and verifying the borrower's information, the lender decides whether to approve or deny the loan application. If approved, the lender will provide a loan estimate outlining the terms, including the interest rate, repayment schedule, and other relevant fees. 6. Explain the closing and funding process: Once the borrower agrees to the loan terms, the closing process ensues. During this phase, the borrower signs the loan documents, and any relevant fees are paid. After closing, the lender disburses the funds, completing the loan origination process. In conclusion, loan originations involve the process of creating, evaluating, and approving loans between borrowers and lenders. This includes the assessment of the borrower's creditworthiness, decision-making on loan approval or denial, and eventual disbursement of funds upon agreement on the loan terms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: LONDON, Feb. 18,2014 (Xinhua News agency) --Britain will send experts to East China's Shanghai to learn from the city's experience in maths teaching in an attempt to raise the teaching standards. British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education. Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths. The education department said: \\"England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany.\\" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject. \\"Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths--their children are streets ahead. Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive mind that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence makes up for lack of ability,\\" Truss said. \\"Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works--early learning of key arithmetic, and a focus on times tables and long division , for instance.\\" She was determined to change the situation as performance in maths is weakening the country's skills base and threatening the productivity and growth. The government is emphasizing maths because of the importance of good grades in the subject... Question: How will students' poor performance in maths affect the country eventually?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Curved Air are a pioneering English progressive rock group formed in 1970 by musicians from mixed artistic backgrounds, including classical, folk, and electronic sound. The resulting sound of the band was a mixture of progressive rock, folk rock, and fusion with classical elements. Along with High Tide and East of Eden, Curved Air were one of the first rock bands after It's a Beautiful Day and the United States of America to feature a violin. Curved Air released eight studio albums, the first three of which broke the UK Top 20, and had a hit single with \\"Back Street Luv\\" (1971) which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. Context: However, Darryl Way and Sonja Kristina remained interested in working together, and so Way brought in two more \\"Car Thieves\\", guitarist Mick Jacques and drummer Stewart Copeland. Though more members of this new lineup came from Stark Naked and the Car Thieves than Curved Air (Kristina being the only member not from the former band), they decided to adopt the Curved Air name for the same reasons that the Kristina/Wedgwood-led band had. With Darryl Way at the helm, this new band often employed the same classical and folk influences as the original band (and even played some of the original band's songs at their shows), but their core sound was rooted in pop, rhythm and blues, and hard rock. Miles Copeland III, still serving as Curved Air's manager, put the group on his own label, BTM.  The band kicked off with a European tour, which started poorly. Way, a notorious perfectionist, grew impatient with the struggling of his bandmates, especially novice drummer Copeland. Then, for reasons no one could pinpoint, the musicians suddenly \\"clicked\\" with each other and the band caught fire, quickly becoming a popular and acclaimed live act.  Their studio efforts were another story, however. Phil Kohn left and the band, unable to replace him in time for the sessions for Midnight Wire, relied on guest musicians to play both bass (John G Perry) and keyboards (Peter Wood). Norma Tager, a friend of Kristina's, penned the lyrics to the \\"Midnight Wire\\" songs. Kohn was later replaced by Tony Reeves, formerly of Colosseum and Greenslade, but the recording sessions for both Midnight Wire and 1976's Airborne were expensive and highly stressful for everyone involved. Both albums - as well as \\"Desiree\\", a single drawn from Airborne - failed to break the charts.  Citing dissatisfaction with BTM Records' inability to support Curved Air financially, Way departed. Though Alex Richman from the Butts Band stepped in on keyboards, the loss of the band's de facto leader was a blow. This line-up's last-ditch attempt at a hit single, a cover version of \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\", was another flop. After months of gradually losing steam, Curved Air broke up so quietly that, by Sonja Kristina's recollections, most of the music press wrote off the band's absence as a \\"sabbatical\\". Copeland formed The Police, Reeves returned to work as a producer and played in semi-pro band Big Chief along with Jacques, and Kristina and Way both pursued solo careers. Kristina and Copeland maintained the close personal relationship they'd formed while bandmates and were married in 1982. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, little buddy! There are some interesting aspects in this article about the band, Curved Air. They formed in 1970 and played a mix of different music styles like progressive rock, folk rock, and even had some classical elements in their songs. They were kind of special because they had a violin in their band, which not many rock bands had back then. Their first three albums were very popular in the UK, and they even had a hit single called \\"Back Street Luv.\\" Over time, their band members changed a lot, and different people joined and left the group. They tried to make music that mixed different styles like pop, rhythm and blues, and hard rock but had a difficult time at first. But then they suddenly got really good at playing together and became a popular live band. Unfortunately, when they were recording their albums in the studio, they had a lot of problems, like not having enough people to play certain instruments and also having to spend a lot of money. Their later albums weren't as successful as the earlier ones, so the band decided to break up. After Curved Air broke up, the band members did other things, like forming new bands or working on their own music. One of the former members, Stewart Copeland, even formed a famous band called The Police.

News article: Death toll rises and fires still rage, but one survivor – a 19-year-old firefighter – is found after the devastating blasts that wrecked the port city on Wednesday      China explosions: a visual guide to what happened in Tianjin Read more      Chinese rescue teams say they have located a survivor more than 30 hours after the city of Tianjin was rocked by a devastating chemical explosion that killed at least 55 people and has forced thousands from their homes.      Rescuers discovered a 19-year-old firefighter – named as Zhou Ti – at 7.05am on Friday morning, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency.      Zhou was taken to Tianjin’s Teda hospital and is in a stable condition, according to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news website.      The discovery offered a rare glimmer of hope as authorities battled to help those left injured or homeless when a warehouse storing hazardous chemicals caught fire and exploded on Wednesday sending a mushroom cloud rising into the night sky.      With acrid black smoke still billowing from the disaster zone, more than 1,020 firefighters continued to battle “raging” fires in the area, Zhou Tian, Tianjin’s fire chief, told Xinhua on Friday.      The official death toll rose to 55 after five more bodies were found, according to state broadcaster CCTV.      As the body count rose, displaced residents took shelter in the homes of relatives or in makeshift government camps set up in local primary schools. At least 6,000 people were expected in such shelters on Thursday night, a local official said.      By Friday morning, around 200 volunteers and family members looking for lost relatives were milling around outside the primary school opposite the GSK Glaxo Smith Kline Tianjin headquarters.      Xie Penchen, a 20-year-old student at Tianjin Business University, said the relocated residents living inside the the school were free to come and go, but the volunteers were not allowed in. Ten army guards stood at the front gate of the compound, alongside a police car.      At the front of the gate, volunteers had erected a tent where they were maintaining long lists and posters featuring the names, descriptions and contact details of some of the missing.      “We have a group on WeChat where volunteers circulate the names of the missing and inform each other if anyone has been found” Xie said.      Asked why the government wasn’t doing this work, Xie said: “They’re focussing on the explosion. That’s more important than this. They don’t have extra energy to deal with this as well.      “Of course this is important too, but while they direct their energy to that, common people like us can offer our help in this way.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Relatives of Tianjin residents missing after the blasts hold up information about their loved ones. Photograph: Fergus Ryan/Guardian      Han Jin, a retired teacher who lives in the Vantone Central Park compound close to the blast site, said she had fled her flat taking nothing but her pink-eared poodle, Little Jingjing.      “When we had to leave, my husband told me to take valuables but all I took was Little Jingjing,” she recalled. “I wouldn’t dream of leaving Jingjing alone here. As long as we’re together it’s fine – even if we die together.”      Han said help – and answers – were not reaching victims fast enough. “On TV all you can see are reports about the army being dispatched to the scene but there’s no news that we really need,” she told the Guardian, standing beneath dozens of crumpled window frames that had been destroyed by the blast.      “What about the questions we really need answers to? When will it be safe to come back? Is the air OK? For people like us who live within 2km of the blast site, how long do we have to wear these masks? What’s happening with the rebuilding and repairs?

There has been a lot of work done by volunteers but to deal with damage of this scale, the government’s help is needed.”      At the Vantone Central Park – which is around 2km from the scene of the disaster – signs of the blast were everywhere.      The glass façade of the Jingcheng Real Estate company had been completely shattered. From a fourth-floor apartment a man peered down from a pane-less window at a carpet of glass.      A bright red banner hanging at the heart of the compound read: “It is everyone’s duty to report crimes involving guns and explosives.”      “Look at this damage – it’s like an earthquake hit,” said Zhang, who said her relatives had fled with their young child following the explosion. “I’ve come because they’re still too scared to come back,” she said. “Young children can’t really comprehend these kinds of things.”      Others were refusing to leave the area around the blast site, despite government calls to evacuate and fears that volatile chemicals could trigger secondary explosions.

(Associated Press)      The two explosions late Wednesday at the Chinese port city— one of them the equivalent of 21 tons of TNT — killed at least 50 people and injured more than 700. The blasts originated at shipping containers owned by a logistics company authorized to handle hazardous material and struck a mostly nonresidential warehouse district.      The death toll included 17 firefighters sent in after the first blast, and would have been much higher in a more populated area. Other firefighters also went missing while responding to the blasts, though authorities have not clarified how many.      One firefighter was pulled from the zone at about dawn Friday and brought to a hospital, where he was being treated for face, chest and feet injuried, the state broadcaster CCTV reported.      \\"Forces from all sides are searching for the (remaining) missing firefighters,\\" Tianjin Fire Department head Zhou Tian said at a news conference early Friday.      The logistics company, Ruihai International Logistics, handled chemicals ranging from flammable gases and liquids including compressed natural gas and ethyl acetate to toxic chemicals like sodium cyanide and toluene diisocyanate.      However, the warehouse was a transit point and authorities do not have a clear picture of what was there at the time of the blasts. Records at the site were destroyed in the disaster, said Gao Huiyou, deputy director of occupational safety in Tianjin.      Zhou said further firefighting efforts most go slow because of the potentially complex mix of chemicals at the site      \\"Many types of different materials with different characteristics are mixed together and could at any time result in a chemical reaction or explosion,\\" Zhou said.      ____      Associated Press writer Ian Mader and news assistant Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| TIANJIN, China China on Friday defended fire fighters who initially hosed water on a blaze in a warehouse storing volatile chemicals, a response foreign experts said could have contributed to two huge blasts that killed 56 people.      At least 21 fire fighters were among the victims of the explosions at the port in the northeastern city of Tianjin on Wednesday night, the official Xinhua news agency said, calling it possibly the highest death toll among fire crews since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.      About 720 people were injured, 25 critically with 33 in serious condition, in a nation all too familiar with industrial disasters.      Columns of smoke from fires still burning on Friday rose from the site amid crumpled shipping containers, thousands of torched cars and burnt-out shells of port buildings.      Rescuers pulled one survivor from the wreckage, later identified as a fire fighter, a city official told reporters.      The warehouse, designed to house dangerous and toxic chemicals, was storing mainly ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium carbide at the time, according to police. Xinhua has said several containers in the warehouse caught fire before the explosions.      The State Council, China's cabinet, said a nationwide inspection of dangerous chemicals and explosives would be launched in response to the disaster, along with a crackdown on illegal activities to strengthen industry safety.      \\"The disastrous explosions at the ... hazardous materials warehouse at Tianjin caused huge loss of life and injuries, economic damages and social impact,\\" the State Council work safety commission said on its website.      \\"The lessons are extremely profound.\\"      Chemical safety experts said calcium carbide reacts with water to create acetylene, a highly explosive gas. An explosion could be caused if fire fighters sprayed the calcium carbide with water, they said.      Lei Jinde, the deputy propaganda department head of China's fire department, a part of the Ministry of Public Security, told state-backed news website ThePaper.cn that the first group of fire fighters on the scene had used water.      \\"We knew there was calcium carbide inside but we didn't know whether it had already exploded,\\" he said.      \\"At that point no one knew, it wasn't that the fire fighters were stupid,\\" Lei said, adding that it was a large warehouse and they didn't know the exact location of the calcium carbide.      FIRE FIGHTERS STILL MISSING      CCTV reported that 13 fire fighters were still missing. Xinhua said earlier that 66 firefighters were among the hundreds of people hospitalized.      David Leggett, a chemical safety expert based in California, told Reuters the acetylene explosion could have detonated the ammonium nitrate. The two blasts were about 30 seconds apart, the second much larger than the first.      \\"In my mind, the presence of ammonium nitrate makes it easier to explain the level of devastation,\\" he said.      Stuart Prescott, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said water was recommended to extinguish the two nitrates but a chemical powder was needed for calcium carbide.      The explosions at the world's 10th largest port were so big they were seen by satellites in space and registered on earthquake sensors.      Biochemical specialists said on state TV they were waiting for workers to clear a road into the site so they could begin assessing chemical contamination.      Several thousand residents were moved to 10 schools after apartment buildings and homes were damaged.      Foreign companies were assessing damage to facilities in and around the port, a gateway to northeast China, which accounts for about 40 percent of China's imported cars, Xinhua reported.      French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) said its warehouse at the port sustained severe damage and an early estimate showed nearly 1,500 of its cars there were burned. Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said more than 50 of its employees had been injured.      Mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) said its port operations and shipments were disrupted but its iron ore discharging berth had not been damaged. Oil tanker arrivals and departures were also disrupted. U.S. farm and construction equipment maker John Deere & Co (DE.N) said several workers were injured, some critically.      Swiss logistics firm Panalpina (PWTN.S) said it was looking into whether exports from China could be funneled through the ports of Qingdao or Dalian as shipments through Tianjin may be disrupted for a week or longer.      PACKAGING VIOLATIONS      Xinhua identified the owner of the warehouse as Tianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics and the China Daily newspaper said its manager had been detained.      The Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration said in a report in January 2014 a safety inspection two years ago found several cases where the company had violated packaging standards.      The company said on its website it was a government-approved firm specializing in handling \\"dangerous goods\\". Phone numbers listed on the site were disconnected and an email went unanswered.      Industrial accidents are not uncommon in China following three decades of fast growth. A blast at an auto parts factory killed 75 people a year ago.      The blasts sent shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away in the city of 15 million people. They shattered windows in buildings and cars and knocked down walls in a 2-km radius.

The combined wealth of people including Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and the Koch Brothers has increased to £1trillion. And the top one per cent of earners are worth £67.3trillion - almost half (46 per cent) of the world's wealth, according to a report by Oxfam. Surge: Warren Buffet (left) and Bill Gates are among the 85 whose wealth equals the 3.5billion poorest. Critics claim the surge in inequality has been driven by 'power grabbing' wealthy elites who harbour close relationships with leading politicians. Winnie Byanyima, chief executive of Oxfam, said: 'It is staggering that in the 21st century, half of the world’s population - that’s three and a half billion people - own no more than a tiny elite whose numbers could all fit comfortably on a double-decker bus. She added: 'In too many countries economic growth already amounts to little more than a ‘winner takes all’ windfall for the richest.' The world now has 1,426 billionaires with a combined wealth of £3.3trillion, and 12million millionaires, the report found. Carlos Slim Helu, head of Telecom, is the richest man in the world. L'Oreal's Lilian Bettencourt is also on the list. The number of US millionaires has increased to 3.7million - up 11.5 per cent on last year - while the UK has an estimated 345,271 net millionaire households - up 12.6 per cent. The findings come as David Cameron and other world leaders fly to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economics Forum, attended by some of the most influential businesses. 1. Carlos Slim Helu (Telecom) £44.6bn. 2. Bill Gates (Microsoft) £41bn. 3. Amancio Ortega (Zara) £34.8bn. 4. Warren Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) £32.7bn. 5. Larry Ellison (Oracle) £26.3bn. 6. Charles Koch (Diversified) £20.8bn. 7. David Koch (Diversified) £20.8bn. 8. Li Ka-shing (Diversified) £19bn. 9. Lilian Bettencourt (L'Oreal) £18.3bn. 10. Bernard Arnault (LVMH) £17.7bn. Oxfam said the focus of the exclusive gathering – which includes more than 2,500 business leaders, heads of state and other powerful figures – must be the ‘extreme economic inequality’ which is ‘undermining social stability and threatening global security’. Ms Byanyima said: 'We cannot hope to win the fight against poverty without tackling inequality. Widening inequality is creating a vicious circle where wealth and power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of us to fight over crumbs from the top table. 'In developed and developing countries alike we are increasingly living in a world where the lowest tax rates, the best health and education and the opportunity to influence are being given not just to the rich but also to their children. 'Without a concerted effort to tackle inequality, the cascade of privilege and of disadvantage will continue down the generations. We will soon live in a world where equality of opportunity is just a dream.' Since the late 1970s, tax rates for the richest have fallen in 29 out of 30 countries for which data are available, said the report. Opinion polls in Spain, Brazil, India, South Africa, the US, UK and Netherlands found that a majority in each country believe that wealthy people exert too much influence. Oxfam's report comes as David Cameron and other world leaders (pictured at the G8 summit) fly to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. Concern was strongest in Spain, followed by Brazil and India and least marked in the Netherlands. In the UK, some 67 per cent agreed that 'the rich have too much influence over where this country is headed' - 37 per cent saying that they agreed 'strongly' with the statement. Just 10 per cent who disagreed, 2 per cent of them strongly. The WEF’s own Global Risks report recently identified widening income disparities as one of the biggest threats to the world community. Highlights:","output":"- The 85 richest people in the world have as much money as the 3.5 billion poorest people combined. - Their total wealth is around £1 trillion. - The top 1% of earners have 46% of the world's wealth, equal to £67.3 trillion. - Oxfam reports that this inequality is causing problems and needs to be addressed. - Taxes for the richest have decreased in 29 countries since the late 1970s."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which friend experienced warmer weather?  Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife.  They would often complain about the weather.  Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.

Question: How many areas of study did Boston University offer degrees in the year Mairson began working there as a Visiting Professor? Passage 1:Flags is a 1985 album by the duo Moraz-Bruford. Unlike their prior effort Music for Piano and Drums, which featured only an acoustic drum kit and grand piano, this recording expanded their musical palette by including a Kurzweil 250 synthesizer and electronic percussion. Keyboardist Patrick Moraz and drummer Bill Bruford had both previously been members of the progressive rock band Yes (though at different points in time) and also appeared together on Chris Squire's first solo album Fish Out of Water. During the recording of this album, Moraz was a member of The Moody Blues, while Bruford's band King Crimson had just begun a hiatus that would last for ten years. Flags features ten instrumental works, including a drum solo based on Max Roach's \\"The Drum Also Waltzes\\".  Passage 2:Mairson received a B.A. in Mathematics from Yale University in 1978 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1984 under the supervision of Jeffrey Ullman. His Ph.D. thesis, The Program Complexity of Searching a Table, won the Machtey Award at the 1983 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS). Mairson was a Postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Rocqencourt from 1984 to 1985, at Stanford University in 1985, and at the University of Oxford in 1986. He held a Visiting Professor position from 1999 to 2001 at Boston University. From 2005 to 2007, Mairson has served as the Chair of the Faculty Senate at Brandeis. He is currently an Associate Editor of the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science and Information and Computation, and sits on the editorial board of Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation.  Passage 3:Pyotr Filippovich Berestov (; , Berestovo – November 26, 1961, Zaporozhye) was a Red Army major general during the Second World War. Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1917, Berestov participated in the Russian Revolution. He was drafted into the Red Army, fighting in the Russian Civil War and the Polish–Soviet War. He became a Red Army officer and served in several positions during the interwar period. Berestov was arrested and released during the Great Purge. He fought in the Winter War as a regimental commander. In the early days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was given command of a People's Militia regiment, which was converted into a regular regiment. Berestov led the regiment in the early period of the Battle of Moscow and transferred to lead a regiment of the 82nd Motor Rifle Division. Berestov became the division's commander and in the spring of 1942 briefly led the 50th Rifle Division. In April, he took command of the 331st Rifle Division, which he led during the rest of the war. For his leadership, Berestov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in late June 1945. Postwar he commanded the 72nd Guards Rifle Division, which was downsized into a brigade, and the 43rd Guards Rifle Brigade, which became the 113th Guards Rifle Division.

Clijsters, U.S. Open champion in 2005, 2009 and 2010, has been out for almost four months after sustaining a stomach muscle injury in August. \\"So far, and today, everything felt really great,\\" the 28-year-old said told the 10,000-strong crowd after winning 6-2 7-6 (7-5) at the Antwerp Sports Palace on Thursday. The Belgian will now focus on preparing to defend her Australian Open crown in Melbourne in January after securing victory in one hour and 35 minutes. However, the","output":"match against Wozniacki was not without its challenges. Both players displayed moments of exceptional skill and determination, with the Danish star putting up a solid fight despite ultimately succumbing to Clijsters' relentless and well-executed game plan. It's important to note that while this was an exhibition match, the intensity on the court was reminiscent of a major tournament, highlighting the strong competitive spirit between these two well-respected athletes. Clijsters' performance in Antwerp has certainly sent a clear message to the tennis world that she is back in form and ready to be a force to be reckoned with on the tour once again. She showcased a highly impressive level of fitness and mobility throughout the match, which are critical factors in the fast-paced sport of tennis. Facing the world number one was a true test for the returning Belgian star and her victory gives her invaluable confidence going into the new season. Clijsters, a fan favorite for her on-court attitude and sportsmanship, can certainly build on this positive momentum as she aims to successfully defend her Australian Open title in the coming weeks. For Wozniacki, the defeat may be a setback, but it would surely be a learning experience. The 21-year-old Dane has consistently shown great potential and tenacity in her career thus far, and she will be going into the 2022 season keen to make her mark and possibly claim the very elusive first grand slam title. In addition to preparing for the Australian Open, both players are likely focused on sharpening their skills, fine-tuning their strategies, and further enhancing their physical conditioning. They will be working closely with their coaching teams and participating in several warm-up events leading up to the start of the first major tournament of the year. The anticipation and excitement of tennis fans around the world are palpable, as they eagerly await the commencement of the new season and the captivating battles that lie ahead.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Open a bottle of wine.","output":"To open a bottle of wine, follow these detailed steps to ensure you accomplish the task successfully and safely: 1. Gather the required tools:    - A wine bottle    - A corkscrew, preferably a double-hinged waiter's corkscrew    - A wine napkin or a small towel (optional) 2. Examine the bottle and remove any foil or outer wrapping:    - Before you begin, observe the wine bottle. Some bottles might have a foil wrapper around the cork and the bottle neck. If this is the case, locate the small tab on the foil, hold the wine bottle firmly with your non-dominant hand, and slowly pull the tab to remove the foil. If there's no tab, use a knife or the foil cutter on the corkscrew to carefully cut the foil around the top of the bottle.    - Alternatively, some bottles might have a wax seal. Gently scrape off the wax with a knife or the blade of the corkscrew. 3. Position the corkscrew and prepare to open the bottle:    - Hold the wine bottle in your non-dominant hand, ensuring to keep a firm grip. With your other hand, open up the corkscrew and unfold the helix (sharp, spiraled portion for inserting into the cork) and the lever of the double-hinged waiter's corkscrew.    - If using a wine napkin or towel, place it around the neck of the bottle to catch any possible wine drips. 4. Insert the corkscrew helix into the cork:    - Position the tip of the helix slightly off-center on the cork.    - Slowly twist the corkscrew handle clockwise, ensuring that the helix enters the cork straight and gradually. Continue twisting until only one curve of the helix remains visible. Avoid going too far, as you might puncture the bottom of the cork, which can lead to wine leakage and cork crumbling. 5. Use the waiter's corkscrew lever to assist in removing the cork:    - Since you are using a double-hinged corkscrew, there will be two notches on the lever. Position the first (lower) notch on the lip of the bottle, keeping the corkscrew handle raised.    - Hold the bottle firmly and begin applying upward pressure on the corkscrew handle while maintaining the lever's position on the bottle lip. This will slowly start to pull the cork out.    - Once the cork has raised enough, switch to the second (upper) notch of the lever and reposition it on the lip of the bottle.    - Continue applying upward pressure on the corkscrew handle, easing the cork out of the bottle until it is almost completely removed. 6. Remove the cork from the corkscrew:    - Gently twist the cork counter-clockwise while pulling it away from the bottle to completely remove it.    - Hold the cork with your non-dominant hand and twist the corkscrew handle counter-clockwise to remove the cork from the corkscrew. 7. Check the cork and wine:    - Inspect the cork for any abnormalities or mold. If everything looks fine, your wine is ready to be served. In case you observe any abnormalities, it's best to consult a wine expert before proceeding.    - If you used a wine napkin, give the bottle neck a gentle wipe to ensure there are no remaining foil or cork particles before pouring. 8. Pour and enjoy your wine:    - Hold the wine bottle towards its base with your non-dominant hand, placing your thumb into the indentation at the bottom for better grip and control.    - Position the wine glass at a slight angle and slowly pour the wine into the glass. Start at the bottom of the glass and gradually raise it upright as it fills up.    - Enjoy your wine responsibly!

Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15... Question: Bank loans are mainly made to women because   _  . Answer: Answer:","output":"Bank loans, specifically micro-credits, are mainly made to women because experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and are more likely to spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. By providing these loans to women, it not only helps them contribute financially to their families but also raises their status within the home and the local community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Upon realizing that the 600-gallon aquarium was too big for his apartment, Mike decided to reevaluate his options. He had always been an avid enthusiast of marine life and thought that an enormous aquarium would be the perfect addition to his living space, transforming it into an underwater haven. Despite his initial excitement, Mike now had to reconsider the situation and find a suitable solution. Considering the fact that buying a larger apartment was not an option, he started looking for alternative ideas to fulfill his passion for aquatic life while also ensuring that the new aquarium would fit seamlessly within the limited confines of his existing apartment. Mike began by researching various aquarium sizes and shapes that might be suitable for his space. While browsing through online forums and asking questions in dedicated social media groups, he learned about the different types of aquariums, such as reef aquariums, fish-only tanks, and nano tanks. This prompted him to measure his apartment carefully, taking note of the available floor space and potential locations for the aquarium. Keeping these constraints in mind, he created a list of appropriate aquarium sizes that would work well in his specific context. Simultaneously, Mike started exploring different species of fish and aquatic plants that would thrive in a smaller environment. He discovered that freshwater species like guppies, tetras, and bettas are generally compatible with smaller aquariums. Additionally, he found out that there were numerous aquatic plants, such as java ferns, anubias, and moss balls, which would not only add aesthetic value but also help maintain water quality. Once he had a grasp of the alternatives available, Mike narrowed down his options to an 80-gallon freshwater aquarium that would accommodate a diverse, yet suitable, mix of fish and plants. He consulted local pet stores to find a brand and model that would best meet his needs, comparing prices to ensure he was making a cost-effective decision. After choosing the perfect 80-gallon aquarium, Mike dedicated his time to setting it up properly. He learned about the nitrogen cycle, proper filtration, and heating techniques to create an optimal environment for his new aquatic inhabitants. He also spent time researching aquascaping and the ideal placement of plants and decorations, resulting in a visually stunning aquatic landscape. In the end, though Mike's initial plan for a massive 600-gallon aquarium had been thwarted by the limited space in his apartment, he adapted his expectations and gained a wealth of knowledge about aquatic life in the process. His passion flourished within the constraints of his situation, and the stunning 80-gallon aquarium he created became an integral part of his living space - a testament to his love for the wonders of the underwater world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Titanophoneus Translate to English","output":"Titanophoneus, in English, refers to a specific genus of prehistoric, carnivorous therapsids that lived during the middle Permian period approximately 260-265 million years ago. The name \\"Titanophoneus\\" is derived from three Greek words: 'titan' meaning \\"deity personifying creative and destructive force,\\" 'phoné' meaning \\"voice\\" or \\"murder,\\" and 'eus' meaning \\"settler\\" or \\"established.\\" Therefore, the genus Titanophoneus can be roughly translated to \\"giant murderous deity\\" in English. The Titanophoneus genus contains only one known species: Titanophoneus potens. This creature existed before the dinosaurs and was considered an apex predator during its time. With a length of around 9-10 feet and a weight of more than 400 kilograms, the Titanophoneus was a powerful and fearsome predator in the Permian ecosystems. The Titanophoneus belonged to the Dinocephalia order, a group of herbivores and carnivores that emerged during the Permian period. Dinocephalians were characterized by their large head size, heavy skulls, and sturdy body structure. Some of the herbivorous members of this group were as large as modern-day elephants. This diverse group of animals dominated the Permian landscape until their decline at the end of the period, giving way to the emergence of other therapsids and eventually the dinosaurs. Fossils of the Titanophoneus have been found particularly in what is now Russia. Its remains were first discovered in the early 20th century by Russian paleontologist V.P. Amalitzky. The Titanophoneus had a long snout, sharp teeth suitable for tearing flesh, and a robust partial shell covering its neck and back. Its forelimbs were strong, while its hind limbs were somewhat longer. The Titanophoneus was likely an agile hunter, using its powerful skull and jaws to subdue prey. Like most therapsid species, the Titanophoneus likely had some mammalian-like characteristics, such as fur or hair, and may have exhibited some degree of maternal care, like brooding and feeding their young. The study of the Titanophoneus and other Permian therapsids helps paleontologists understand the transition between reptiles and mammals and the evolution of diverse fauna before the rise of the dinosaurs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company. During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise. He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said \\"untrustworthy,\\" so she decided to offer the job to her second choice. \\"It wasn't until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person.\\" Tiffany admits. What she hadn't known at the time of the interview was that the candidate's \\"different\\" behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding. He was an Asian-American raised in a family where respect for those in authority was shown by turning away your eyes. \\"I was just thrown off by the lack of eye contact, not realizing it was cultural,\\" Tiffany says. \\"I missed out, but will not miss that opportunity again.\\" Many of us have had similar experiences with behaviors we describe as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our understanding of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions   . Hire Advantage At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult, employers who can have no personal biases   from the process have an obvious advantage. My company, Mindsets LLC, helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots. A real estate   agent we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make . \\"During my Mindsets coaching period, I was taught how to own a diversified workforce. I employed people from different cultures and skill sets. The agents were able to make use of their full potential and experiences to build up the company. When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.\\" Blinded by Gender Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops in charge of a diverse workforce. \\"Through some of the lessons, I discovered my personal bias.\\" he recalls. \\"I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person, and being open to differences.\\" In his case, the blindness was not about culture but rather gender. \\"I had a management position open in my department; and the two finalists were a man and a woman. Had I not attended this workshop, I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel. My assumption would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position, I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel.\\" Dale's assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization's ability to promote the full potential of a diverse workforce. \\"I learned from the class that instead of forcing my gender biases into the situation, I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision.\\" Dale sings high praise for the workshop, \\"because it helped me make decisions based on fairness.\\" A better Bottom Line An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations from inside, it is profitable as well. These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales.\\" Most of my customers speak English as a second language. One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone. It wasn't until my boss received Mindsets' training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service. As a result, our customer base has increased.\\" Once we start to see people as individuals, we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone. Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities and about building better communities and organizations. When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers, family, friends, etc, we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are imperfect or contrary to our fundamental values. We need to train ourselves to think differently, shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us, creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: In simplest terms, this means that any word you would underline in a handwritten letter to emphasize, or would say more forcefully than others when speaking, you would italicize in a word processing document or on a website. For example, “I am the only living only child among my first cousins.” Foreign words and phrases used in English writing for effect are italicized, such as using the German Turnverein in place of the common American term “athletic club.” Foreign words that have become part of the English language through common usage, such as “kindergarten,” are not italicized. The Latin words for the genus and species of an organism are also italicized, as in Homo sapiens. This is normally done when the terms are first introduced, particularly if they have a meaning different from what the reader is used to. Physical constants, such as c for the speed of light, and variables in algebra, as in “ n = 2,” are also rendered in italics. A block quotation is a lengthy quotation (typically 100 words or more, or at least 5 to 8 lines of text) set off from the rest of the text and indented. Block quotations are often rendered in italics, or in a different font or point size.  When an item in a block quote would be italicized, and the rest of the block quote is already in italics, the item is commonly rendered in normal text to set it off from the block quote. Large blocks of italicized text can be hard to read on some computer screens. In such cases, you may want to render block quotes in a different font than the surrounding text. While you do not italicize the make, model, or military designation of a vehicle, vessel, or craft, you do italicize the following named vessels:  Trains (The Golden State Limited), but not the names of individual cars. Ships, either military or passenger vessels (USS Lexington, Queen Elizabeth II). Aircraft names or nicknames not based on construction or performance characteristics (Memphis Belle or Cutter’s Goose from the TV show Tales of the Gold Monkey, but not the Batplane). Spacecraft, either real or fictional (the Space Shuttle Challenger, the starship Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon). Space missions, such as Apollo 11, are not italicized. The following works have their titles rendered in italics, unless a particular style manual (such as AP or MLA) dictates otherwise:  Books (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone), except for the titles of religious books such as the Bible or the Koran. Titles of chapters, sections, and short stories within anthologies are enclosed in double quotes. Magazines (Collier’s, Reader’s Digest). Titles of articles (“I Am Joe’s Kidney”) are enclosed in double quotes. Newspapers (USA Today, The Wall Street Journal). Plays (Romeo and Juliet, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?). Court cases (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka). Television and radio programs (Star Trek, The Shadow). Titles of episodes (“Amok Time,” “Temple Bells of Neban”) are enclosed in double quotes. Record albums (Mandatory Fun, Red). Titles of album tracks (“Word Crimes,” “I Knew You Were Trouble”) are enclosed in double quotes. Artwork (Mona Lisa, The Last Supper). Punctuation marks that are part of the title are italicized with the rest of the title. In fiction, when a character’s thoughts are put into words for the sake of the reader, they are commonly rendered in italics, as in “Kate regarded her husband with apprehension. That’s funny, Joe never asks for a second cup of my coffee.” If you’re attempting to render a sound with a word the way the reader would hear it, italicize the word: “The startled cat gave out an angry Meeeowwwrr!” If you’re using a word to describe a general sound, you don’t italicize it: “The cat meowed.”","output":"In summary, italics are used to emphasize words, denote foreign terms, and indicate variables and physical constants in writing. Additionally, italicized text marks named vessels like trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft, as well as titles of books, magazines, newspapers, plays, court cases, and television programs. They are also utilized to convey character thoughts and emphasize sounds in fiction writing. However, large blocks of italicized text may be difficult to read on some screens, and some style manuals provide specific guidelines for italicization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Does Jones destroy the Ark like he threatens to? Movie plot title: Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark Movie plot: In 1936, archaeologist Indiana Jones braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in Peru and retrieves a golden idol. He is confronted by rival archaeologist RenÃ© Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Indy surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane. Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her. The pair travels to Cairo, where they meet up with Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the... Answer:","output":"In Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones, also known as Indy, does not destroy the Ark as he initially threatens to do. Towards the end of the movie, Indy and Marion are captured by the Nazis, and Belloq plans to open the Ark to harness its power. Indy, posing a threat to destroy the Ark with an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade), only does so to buy time and stall the enemies. Ultimately, the Ark is opened during a ceremony led by Belloq, and the supernatural power within the Ark is unleashed. As the Ark is opened, Indy and Marion avoid the devastating consequences by closing their eyes and not looking at the unfolding events. The Ark's power manifests as otherworldly creatures and intense energy that destroy the Nazis, including Belloq and his men. All those who directly witness the Ark's power are killed on the spot. After the catastrophic event, Indy and Marion are left unscathed, and the Ark is closed and sealed. The U.S. government takes possession of the Ark and stores it in a massive warehouse, supposedly for further study and safekeeping. In summary, although Jones threatens to destroy the Ark to stop the Nazis, he never actually does it. Instead, the Ark ultimately brings about the destruction of the Nazis seeking to control it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Many popular brands (think stores like Gap) and designers (look at Isabella Oliver) sell maternity clothing. While some women feel “guilty” for spending money on clothing that they will only wear for a finite amount of time, it is important to purchase clothing that fits your changing body, is comfortable to wear, and makes you feel beautiful.  If you do not have the budget to purchase maternity clothing, consider asking a friend who has had a child if she has anything you might borrow for the remainder of your pregnancy. In addition, consignment clothing stores can be a great place to find maternity wear for affordable prices. Think about finding “staples”- clothes that can be worn and re-worn and apply to many situations. If you purchase a pair of jeans, some leggings, tank tops, and cardigans, you will find yourself able to wear these pieces over and over again.  Choose clothes in solid color, which look more sophisticated and are wearable in many different situations! Darker colors can often help you appear slimmer, too. During your pregnancy, treat yourself to something that makes you feel beautiful. Whether it’s a manicure, pedicure, or facial, choose a spa treatment (or several!) that will provide a few hours to relax and enable you to walk away feeling beautiful. Alternatively, you can treat yourself to a pregnancy (or prenatal massage). Studies have shown that receiving massage therapy during pregnancy can help reduce anxiety, relieve muscle aches and joint pain, and improve labor outcomes.  When booking a prenatal massage, ensure that you find a massage therapist who is specifically certified in prenatal massage.  You may also want to confer with your prenatal care provider about obtaining a prenatal massage before booking one. You should absolutely speak with your doctor if you suffer from a high-risk pregnancy. Your body is going through a lot of dramatic changes right now, and in addition, your life is about to change forever with the addition of your little one. That makes the time during your pregnancy a great time to treat yourself. If looking beautiful is your goal, pick something to splurge on that will make you feel as beautiful as ever.  Book a haircut at the new fancy salon in town. Enjoy a new haircut that flatters your changing figure (which may include changes to the shape and size of your face). However, wait until at least the second trimester to schedule highlights, as there is worry that the chemicals in hair dyes can negatively affect your baby.  Finally buy those new earrings that you’ve been eyeing up. Use your pregnancy as a reason to buy yourself something that makes you feel beautiful. Create a positive feeling about both your inner and outer beauty that you associate with that item, and anytime you need a bit of a “pick-me-up”, use that item to remind yourself that you are beautiful. Summary:","output":"This article highlights the importance of maternity clothing, feeling beautiful, and self-care during pregnancy. Popular brands and designers offer maternity clothing options, and even though some may feel guilty about spending money on temporary clothing, it is crucial to have comfortable, fitting clothes that make expecting mothers feel good. If budget is a concern, borrowing from friends or shopping at consignment stores can be an alternative. Having staple maternity clothing items like jeans, leggings, tank tops, and cardigans in solid colors will provide versatility for various occasions. Darker colors can also help create a slimmer appearance. Self-care during pregnancy can involve spa treatments or prenatal massages, which have shown to have multiple benefits for expectant mothers. However, it is essential to find a certified prenatal massage therapist and consult with a prenatal care provider before booking one. Some ways to feel beautiful during pregnancy include splurging on a haircut, holding off on highlights until the second trimester to avoid any potential harm to the baby, or treating oneself to something special like earrings. By associating a positive feeling with items that boost self-confidence, pregnant women can remind themselves of their beauty during this significant life change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

The film tells the story of what happens when Union soldier Corporal John McBurney (played by Colin Farrell) is taken in when one of the schoolgirls finds him injured - and he becomes an object of fascination for pupils and teachers alike. The 19-year-old plays rebellious Alicia in the Sofia Coppola film, which won her the best director accolade at Cannes this year. Fanning, star of last year's Neon Demon, said she'd stayed \\"extremely close\\" to Coppola since working with her on 2010's Somewhere. She got an email with the script for The Beguiled attached, saying Kirsten Dunst was to play teacher Edwina - and with a specific part in mind for Fanning. \\"She thought that would be fun to make me the naughty one,\\" said Fanning, adding that another draw was that it's set in the south, where she's from herself. The Beguiled is based on the Clint Eastwood film of the same name - and the Thomas P Cullinan novel The Painted Devil, which inspired that 1971 movie. \\"It's a remake of that and also a different take on that - Sofia Coppola-esque, from a different point of view, from the women's perspective this time,\\" explains Fanning.

Given the following context:  After fleeing from her abusive stepfather, Nola travels to New York City searching for her biological father. She spends her first night sleeping in Central Park, but her luck changes when she is hired by the owner of a small diner. She ends up staying with the frycook/law school student Ben until the real owner of the diner, Ben's landlady Margaret, hires Nola as her assistant for her escort service. Things go well at the escort service until Niles, a billionaire client of Margaret's service, has a bad session. Niles likes to receive rough physical activity from men cross-dressing as women, but only to a point. Wendy, one of Niles's favorites, went a little too far and sent Niles into a rage. Niles demands Margaret rough Wendy up or else he will have it done, along with inducing the police to investigate the escort service. Nola attempts to help by making up Wendy to look battered and bruised, documenting it with photos, then sending her out of the country until Niles can calm down. Niles's informants spot Wendy, no longer wearing the bruise makeup, trying to flee. Niles responds by arranging a subpeona for Margaret to appear before a grand jury and calling Nola directly, threatening her by revealing detailed information about her upbringing.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the instrument for which Saint-Saëns's pupil left no legacy of works?  Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, \\"this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark\\". Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique. Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed \\"the French Beethoven\\", and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas. He is not known even to have contemplated writing one. There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces. In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as \\"Souvenir d'Italie\\" (1887), \\"Les cloches du soir\\" (\\"Evening bells\\", 1889) and \\"Souvenir d'Ismaïlia\\" (1895). Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo. Some of them were written for use in church services – \\"Offertoire\\" (1853), \\"Bénédiction nuptiale\\" (1859), \\"Communion\\" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former. Answer:","output":"The name of the instrument for which Saint-Saëns's pupil, Fauré, left no legacy of works is the organ."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

A wall of bookcases dominated the living room, each shelf crammed with two, sometimes three layers of books, videotapes, CD's and DVD's. More stacks of books and magazines stood in every corner. Paul was certain they would have taken over all the other flat spaces as well, were it not for the half-assembled computers and three dusty old monitors occupying the coffee table, end tables, and everything in between. The only semi-open spaces were the two couches that faced each other from across the room. A large red and black checkered blanket covered one of them, while the other was cracked but still serviceable brown leather. Thrift store purchases both, Paul thought. \\"The computer stuff belongs to one of my roommates,\\" Chloe said. \\"She's always fiddling with those things to get better performance or whatever.

There was clutter in there certainly, but no dirty dishes or leftover foodstuffs appeared in evidence. Along the left wall was a cheap, plastic patio table with long wooden benches on each side and miss-matched chairs at either end. Newspapers, books, and a laptop occupied most of its surface area, but the end closest to Paul seemed clear enough to see actual use as a place for dining. \\"Is peanut butter ok?\\" she asked, motioning him towards one of the chairs. \\"Sure,\\" he said and sat down at the table.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Initially, I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion (and here being Christianity), and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith, or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou. Surprisingly, it was none of the sort and was largely non-judgemental, putting in place events as a matter of fact, and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion.And I can't help but to chuckle at the role of Song Kang-ho, a man who's taken a liking for widower Shin-ae (Jeong Do-yeon), and starts going to church when she does. The reasons for church going are many I suppose, either to find inner peace, to seek help, being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of Hell, to reaffirm faith, or even things like wanting to get married in a church, or to skirt chase (I kid you not). But to each his own reasons for turning up in church every Sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship, what is indeed dangerous, is when the underlying ulterior motives, do not get satisfied, and that's when frustration sets in. Or when you discover how hypocritical man can be, portraying one face inside the house of God, and displaying yet another outside.Shin-ae and her son Jun moves to the town of Miryang, which is the birthplace of her deceased husband. Wanting to start life anew, she opens up a piano shop to give lessons, though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment's lack of good judgement, has another tragedy befall her. And that takes one hour to get to. Secret Sunshine really took its time to get to this point, where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with Shin-ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state, reveling in the comfort that religion, and fellow believers, can offer.What began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind, and sometimes you wonder if it's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you, that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything's good going your way, and in Shin-ae's case, her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her, forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too.The last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty, where most of us can identify with - why me, and why not someone else, as we rage against our faith and start questioning, unfortunately, with no hard and fast answers available. It is then either we fall by the wayside, or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously. But somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in Secret Sunshine so as not to offend, and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece, got muted.If you bite into the hype this movie is generating, then perhaps you'll realize only Jeong Do- yeon's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning, as she totally owns her role as the widow Shin-ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on Earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time, and if you look at it carefully, most of which are of her own doing. Watching her transformation, is worth the ticket price, and despite having my personal favourite Korean actor Song Kang-ho in the movie, this is something he just breezed right through.","output":"This task asks you to classify a given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative, based on the content of the review.

As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare change. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in a parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, which was the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings. But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and practically emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can only imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky.

Paragraph: He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith.

Natalie never checks the air in the tires while Tanya does and you just knew","output":"that one day it would come back to haunt her. It was a surprisingly sunny morning when Natalie and Tanya decided to go for a road trip. As they were preparing to leave, Tanya, being the responsible one, insisted on checking the air pressure of the tires on her car. She always knew the importance of tire maintenance and the role it played in ensuring a safe and comfortable drive. Tanya had even shared numerous articles and tips with Natalie about maintaining proper tire pressure, but Natalie, always a free spirit, just couldn't be bothered with such mundane matters. Natalie, on the other hand, excitedly hopped into her car without giving a second thought about the air in her tires. She always believed in living life spontaneously, without worrying about every minor detail. As they drove off in separate cars, Tanya couldn't help but worry about Natalie's lack of concern for her vehicle's maintenance. The journey began smoothly, with both friends enjoying the scenic route and the wind in their hair. But as the miles wore on, suddenly and without warning, Natalie's car began to wobble. The vibrations grew more intense, eventually becoming impossible to ignore. With growing alarm, Natalie gripped the steering wheel tightly and signaled for Tanya to pull over. As both cars came to a stop, Tanya leaped out to inspect Natalie's tires. As they had feared, one of Natalie's tires was severely underinflated, causing the wobble and putting her safety at risk. Tanya couldn't help but feel a mixture of concern and frustration at Natalie's carelessness. She knew that improper tire pressure could not only lead to an increased chance of a blowout, but also decreased fuel efficiency, uneven tire wear, and reduced handling capabilities. Natalie sheepishly acknowledged that she should have paid more attention to Tanya's advice. Fortunately, Tanya was prepared for such an eventuality and always carried a portable air compressor in her trunk. She proceeded to inflate Natalie's tire to the proper level and gave her a stern reminder about the importance of routine tire maintenance. Natalie promised to be more diligent in the future, clearly shaken by the near accident. After this incident, Natalie began to make an effort to check her tires regularly, realizing that safety should never be compromised for the sake of spontaneity and carelessness. Tanya was relieved to see her friend taking this essential aspect of car maintenance more seriously, and their road trips continued without any further tire-related mishaps. Looking back, the day Natalie never checked the air in her tires was a turning point for their friendship. It taught them both the valuable lesson of how being cautious and responsible can not only save lives, but also strengthen the bond between friends who were always there to look out for each other. And you just knew, from that day on, that Natalie's newfound commitment to safety would ensure many more safe and enjoyable road trips for them both."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  and the situation: Two countries had big rivers discharging in the same ocean. Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  Answer the following question: Which country caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean?","output":"Given the background information and the situation provided, it can be inferred that Finland caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean compared to Russia.  Finland, being environmentally conscious, likely implemented sustainable agricultural practices and pollution control measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants into rivers and eventually the ocean. They might have focused on reducing agricultural runoff, using organic or environmentally friendly fertilizers, and treating livestock and human waste effectively before releasing it into the water bodies. Moreover, the country's awareness and commitment to reducing marine pollution could have resulted in more stringent regulations and enforcement, further minimizing pollutant release. On the other hand, Russia practiced conventional agriculture, which involves the usage of chemical fertilizers that can have a detrimental impact on aquatic ecosystems when they enter rivers and the ocean. These fertilizers, which contain high levels of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, promote excessive algal growth (eutrophication) in water bodies. When this algae decomposes, it consumes oxygen, leading to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones in marine environments. Additionally, the lack of mention of any specific pollution control measures or environmentally-friendly practices in Russia indicates a higher potential for hazardous particles and pollutants to enter the ocean via rivers. In summary, based on the information provided, Finland is likely responsible for fewer hazardous particles reaching the ocean due to their environmental awareness and commitment to sustainable practices. However, it is essential to consider that the comparison is relative, and both countries could still contribute to marine pollution to different extents. A more accurate assessment would require precise data on the pollutant discharge levels and the effectiveness of pollution control measures implemented in each country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(A). rotation of crops. (B). use of fertilizers. (C). destruction of habitat. (D). introduction of competing species.","output":"(C). Destruction of Habitat The most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms is by the destruction of habitat. Although other factors like rotation of crops, use of fertilizers, and introduction of competing species can negatively impact organisms, habitat destruction has the most widespread and significant impact on biodiversity. Habitat Destruction: Various human activities contribute to habitat destruction, which are outlined below: 1. Agricultural expansion: As the human population continues to grow, there is an increasing need for agricultural land to feed the expanding global population. This expansion typically results in the conversion of natural ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and wetlands into agricultural fields. As the landscape changes, organisms that were adapted to the original ecosystem lose vital resources such as shelter, food, and breeding sites, making survival increasingly difficult. 2. Deforestation: Logging and the clearing of forests for livestock grazing and urbanization often lead to severe reductions in the availability of suitable habitats for many species. Forests are complex ecosystems that support a diverse range of organisms. When deforestation occurs, thousands of species lose their homes, and some inevitably face extinction. 3. Urbanization and industrialization: The development of roads, cities, and industries often results in significant habitat loss. As a result, many species are confined to small fragments of remaining natural habitats, leaving them vulnerable to decline and extinction. Urbanization also results in fragmented habitats, making it difficult for species to maintain healthy population levels and genetic diversity. 4. Climate change: Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation increase the concentration of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. This, in turn, leads to changing climate, weather patterns, and sea level rise, which disrupt ecosystems and force many species to adapt or face extinction. As their habitats change or disappear, some organisms may be unable to adapt quickly enough. 5. Wetland drainage: Wetlands are essential habitats for many unique species of plants and animals, but they are frequently drained to create more agricultural land, build houses, or for industrial purposes. This often leads to the disappearance of entire ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them. 6. Mining and extraction: The extraction of natural resources such as minerals, oil, and gas typically results in significant landscape changes and the pollution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. This often leads to the decline or disappearance of species that depend on these habitats. In conclusion, habitat destruction is the most common way humans contribute to the extinction of organisms. While agricultural practices, pollution, and species introduction can also have negative impacts, the widespread loss of viable habitats due to various human activities remains the primary driver of species declines and extinction. As we continue to develop land for agriculture, urban expansion, and resource extraction, we must also work towards conservation and restoration efforts to mitigate the impact of habitat destruction on the world's vulnerable species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For a group of first responders who saved the life of a 2-year-old horrifically maimed in a lawn mower accident last month, their recent reunion proved as much needed closure for them as well as her family. 'I'm not an emotional guy, but it's awesome to see her doing so well,' Florida Sunstar paramedic Christopher Jennings told TampaBay.com after seeing Ireland Nugent in Largo on Wednesday. 'It's good closure for us,' the 33-year-old said, like so many of the other paramedics celebrating her miraculous recovery around him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Many heroes: Nicole Nugent holds her 2-year-old daughter Ireland as BayFlite Flight Paramedic Chris Williams, one of her many heroes last month, signs her pink arm cast during a special reunion on Wednesday. Terrifying accident: Ireland lost both of her feet last month after her dad mistakenly backed his lawn mower over her. For the last month Jennings says he's been an emotional wreck after first meeting the blonde, blue-eyed girl after she was mistakenly run over by a lawn mower at her home in Palm Harbor. Jennings said he sat with co-workers sobbing in a church parking lot immediately after moving her into a Bayflite helicopter that fateful day. He says he's usually not prone to tears but Ireland's terrifying injuries and near death really got the best of him. On Wednesday Ireland smiled and giggled in the arms of her mother and father during a special visit to the Sunstar Paramedic headquarters in Largo to meet with her heroes after her hospital discharge earlier this month. It was on April 11th her mother, Nicole Nugent, watched in terror as her daughter ran after her father, Jerry Nugent, as he unsuspectingly rode a lawn mower up their driveway. Recovery: Ireland lost both her feet below the knees and also cut up her left hand and broke her thumb during the horrific accident in her front yard last month. New friends: One of the many first responders cheerfully holds Ireland in her arms as they lined up to eat together. Closure: The Nugent family's visit to the Sunstar Paramedic headquarters in Largo on Wednesday provided equal chance for the family to say thank you and for everyone who helped to receive some long-needed closure. The mother, Nicole Nugent, gestured for him to stop but he misunderstood her and instead put the vehicle in reverse - backing over his little girl. If it wasn’t for people like her nextdoor neighbor, Aly Smith, who’s a nurse and was able to slow Ireland’s blood loss until paramedics arrived, her daughter - seen on Wednesday wearing a red ribbon in her hair above an American flag dress – wouldn’t have survived. 'I mean, I don't think she understands any of this because she's two and I think she's happy to meet new friends,' Mrs Nugent told TampaBay.com on Wednesday. 'But for me, it kind of brings a little closure to that night.' Many thanks: Ireland sits in the arms of her mother as her father talks with the first responders around him, men and women he owes his daughter's life to. 'We lose contact with patients once they are admitted into the hospital so it gives us a kind of chance to touch base with family and see that our work wasn't in vain,' June Poxon, a Bayflite nurse also told the website. Ireland underwent seven surgeries after her legs were severed below the knees and she sustained cuts to her left hand. She also broke her thumb. Mrs Nugents credits everyone who helped saved her daughter as her personal heroes, as much as her daughter’s. ‘They helped save my daughter,’ she said. ‘They are a part of my family now.’ WATCH THE VIDEO HERE:.

Given the fact that:  Muscles that are exercised are bigger and stronger than muscles that are not exercised.  Answer the question:   Jimbo liked to work out a lot, while James never worked out. Which person would have weaker muscles Jimbo or James? Answer:","output":"Based on the fact that muscles that are exercised are bigger and stronger than muscles that are not exercised, it can be inferred that Jimbo, who likes to work out a lot, would have stronger and larger muscles compared to James, who never works out. The human body consists of various different muscles that can be classified into three categories: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscles are the muscles that we typically associate with exercise and physical activity, as they are attached to the bones. These muscles are responsible for locomotion, posture, and movement in general. When subjected to regular physical activity such as working out, these skeletal muscles undergo hypertrophy, which is an increase in muscle fiber size, leading to an overall increase in muscle mass and strength. Jimbo, who likes to work out a lot, is consistently placing stress and strain on his muscles during his workouts. By doing so, he promotes the growth and strengthening of his muscles through a process known as adaptation. His muscles respond to the continuous physical activity and resistance training by breaking down and repairing themselves, which ultimately leads to a growth in the size and therefore the strength of the muscles. On the other hand, James, who never works out, does not place any additional stress on his muscles, besides their regular use in day-to-day activities. As a result, his muscles do not undergo the same hypertrophy process, leading to smaller muscle fibers and less overall muscle mass and strength compared to Jimbo. Consequently, James is more prone to muscle atrophy, which is the loss of muscle mass and strength due to disuse or inactivity. Moreover, regularly engaging in workouts and physical activity not only strengthens muscles but also improves various other aspects of one's physical health, such as cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, and overall body composition. Jimbo, who exercises regularly, is likely to have numerous other health benefits associated with his active lifestyle and increased muscle mass, such as reduced risk of chronic diseases, improved bone density, and better mental well-being. Considering all these factors, it is evident that James, who never works out, would have weaker muscles than Jimbo, who likes to work out a lot. Jimbo's consistent engagement in physical activity allows him to develop and maintain larger and stronger muscles compared to James, whose sedentary lifestyle contributes to weaker and less developed muscles."},{"instruction":"Q: Fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their what?

Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from Arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. Saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid (Figure 3.14).

Then he called on Dave.  \\"I've just received a letter I want you to read,\\" he said. \\"It is from Nick Jasniff, and he mentions you.\\" And he handed over the communication.  It was a long rambling epistle, upbraiding Plum roundly for \\"having gone back on him,\\" as Jasniff put it. The writer said he was now \\"doing Europe\\" and having a good time generally. One portion of the letter read as follows:  \\"The authorities needn't look for me, for they will never find me. I struck a soft thing over here and am about seventy pounds to the good.

Not only is it stylish, but it's also practical, pulling your hair back and away from your face. Whether you're gearing up for a grueling workout or dressing up for a chic party, a ponytail works wonders. This detailed guide will walk you through the process of creating the perfect ponytail that accentuates your features and suits every occasion. Section 1: Preparing Your Hair 1.1 Clean and Dry Hair: Start by ensuring your hair is clean and dry, simply because it's more comfortable to work with, and your ponytail will hold better without the greasy feel. Wash and condition your hair before drying it thoroughly either naturally or with a hairdryer. 1.2 Brush Your Hair: Detangle your hair with a brush or comb to get rid of any knots or tangles before styling. This step is crucial because it will make pulling your hair back much easier and prevent any discomfort while adjusting the ponytail. 1.3 Apply Hair Product: Choose a hair product that works best for your hair type, such as a smoothing serum for frizzy hair or a texturizing spray for flat hair. These products will assist in achieving a smooth and polished ponytail while providing extra hold. Optionally, you can use a heat protectant spray if you plan on using styling tools to create a sleek finish. Section 2: Choose the Right Ponytail Placement 2.1 High Ponytail: A high ponytail placement adds a fun, youthful vibe and can suit those with heart-shaped or oval faces. To create a high ponytail, gather your hair at the top of your head level with the crown. 2.2 Mid-Level Ponytail: For a more classic and sophisticated look, opt for a mid-level ponytail. Gather your hair at the midpoint between the nape of your neck and the crown of your head. This placement suits almost every face shape and is ideal for casual or professional settings. 2.3 Low Ponytail: A low ponytail is perfect for a chic and elegant look, especially for those with round or square face shapes. Gather your hair at the nape of your neck for this placement. It works well for formal occasions and minimizes the appearance of short hair length. Section 3: Creating the Perfect Ponytail 3.1 Gather Your Hair: Start by gathering your hair in your hands while being mindful of the chosen placement. Smooth out any bumps or loose strands with a brush or comb, creating a refined appearance. 3.2 Secure the Ponytail: With your hair gathered and smoothed, use a hair tie or elastic band to secure the ponytail. Ensure it's tight enough to hold your hair in place but not too tight where it causes discomfort or damages your hair. 3.3 Adjust and Tighten: Once secured, pull the ends of the ponytail to tighten it further, ensuring it stays in place. Remember not to pull too hard, as this may cause breakage or discomfort. 3.4 Tame Flyaways: To achieve a sleek and polished finish, apply a small amount of hairspray or an anti-frizz product to your hands, and gently smooth it over your hair, focusing on the hairline where flyaways typically occur. Section 4: Finishing Touches and Variations 4.1 Cover the Hair Tie: For a more upscale look, wrap a strand of hair around the hair tie to conceal it. Secure it with a bobby pin beneath the ponytail to keep it in place. 4.2 Add Volume: To add volume to your ponytail, gently backcomb the upper portion of the ponytail or use a texturizing spray to create fuller and thicker-looking hair. 4.3 Accessorize: Enhance your ponytail with accessories such as ornamental hairpins, scrunchies, scarves, or barrettes to suit your outfit or the occasion. Conclusion A well-styled ponytail showcases confidence and sophistication while keeping your hair tamed and away from your face. With this detailed guide, you can easily create the perfect ponytail that radiates effortless chic, regardless of the occasion. Whether it be casual, professional, or glamorous, mastering the art of the ponytail is an essential skill for anyone in search of stylish, versatile, and timeless hairstyles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea The answer is:","output":"The final step of the process involving the liver is the conversion of ammonia to urea. To provide a thorough understanding, let's walk through the process from the beginning, breaking down each step: 1. Liver filters blood from the digestive tract: The liver is a vital organ that serves many essential functions in the body, including processing nutrients and breaking down toxins. One of its primary responsibilities is filtering and detoxifying blood, which it does by receiving blood rich in nutrients from the digestive tract through the portal vein. This blood carries a mixture of nutrients, including glucose, vitamins, minerals, and other components acquired from digested food. 2. Liver produces bile: Another important function of the liver is the production of bile, a greenish liquid responsible for aiding digestion. Bile breaks down dietary fats into smaller droplets (emulsification), which can be efficiently absorbed and further processed by the small intestine. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and then released into the small intestine when food arrives. 3. Liver produces proteins for blood plasma: The liver is involved in synthesizing essential proteins that form part of blood plasma. These proteins have various functions including coagulation (blood clotting), immune response, and maintaining the balance of fluids in the body. Key proteins produced by the liver include albumin, fibrinogen, and globulins. 4. Liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage: One of the liver's roles in maintaining blood sugar balance is by converting excess glucose (sugar) into a compound called glycogen. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that serves as the primary form of glucose storage in the body. When blood sugar levels are low, the liver can convert glycogen back into glucose, ensuring that the body has a stable supply of energy. 5. Liver converts ammonia to urea (final step): The liver plays a crucial role in eliminating nitrogenous waste from the body. A byproduct of breaking down proteins during metabolism is ammonia, which is toxic and harmful to the body's cells. The liver converts this ammonia into a less toxic compound called urea, which is then transported through the bloodstream to the kidneys. The kidneys filter the blood and excrete urea as part of urine, effectively getting rid of excess nitrogen and maintaining the balance of chemicals within the body. In summary, the liver is a multifunctional organ that filters blood, produces essential proteins, processes nutrients, and detoxifies harmful substances within the body. The final step in this process is the conversion of toxic ammonia into a less harmful compound called urea, allowing the body to safely eliminate nitrogenous waste."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In doing so, they suggested Republicans were blocking the bill because it would extend its protections to illegal immigrants as well as gays and lesbians. Many Republicans were furious at that suggestion and accused Democrats of election-year politics by trying to paint Republicans as anti-women. \\"Let me put this on the table,\\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. \\"This bill includes lesbians and gay men. The bill includes undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse. The bill gives Native American tribes authority to prosecute crimes. In my view these are improvements. Domestic violence is domestic violence.\\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the lone Republican to join in the floor speeches, said domestic violence victims in her state are often isolated in rural communities \\"where there is no law enforcement and there is no shelter and there is nowhere to go,\\" she said. \\"The Violence Against Women Act is, I think, a ray of hope for those who service victims of domestic violence and sexual assault within our villages.\\" \\"Nobody opposes the reauthorization of this legislation,\\" Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Senate Republican, told CNN. \\"If you follow the Judiciary Committee work on it, the questions had to do with the additions that have been made to this bill related to illegal immigrant visas, related to the additional sums of money and grants that would be available and the like. \\"So what Republicans are focusing on is how to make a bill that should be reauthorized functional in this day and age of significant budget constraints so we can still accomplish the goals of the legislation,\\" Kyl continued. \\"I really resent the implication by some of my Democratic friends that if you're trying to improve the bill that somehow you are for violence against women. That's reprehensible.\\" Asked whether the provisions about undocumented immigrants and gays and lesbians needed to be pulled from the bill, Kyl said: \\"I don't know. Reasonable people ought to be able to sit down and work these things out.\\" Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, accused reporters of \\"carrying Schumer's water,\\" when they asked him whether he opposed the bill because it would include illegal immigrants and gays and lesbians. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is the Democrats' top message strategist in the Senate. Republicans think it was his idea to suddenly put VAWA on the floor, just after high-profile battles over other women's issues -- like abortion and contraception -- were in the news. \\"I'm always for the Violence Against Women bill,\\" said Sessions who voted for a GOP alternative bill that was defeated in the Democratic-majority Judiciary Committee. But he said every time VAWA is up for reauthorization, \\"if you don't agree with everything that's in it, they just attack you as being anti-women.\\" Sessions added that he was not aware until Thursday the Democrats bill extended to lesbian, gays and illegal immigrants but he acknowledged voters could misread Republicans' views on the bill. \\"I think we should be sensitive to the impressions we cast by our votes and so forth but fundamentally you can't vote a piece of legislation you don't think is sound,\\" Sessions said. One bit of evidence that Democrats were, in fact, trying to use the issue for their political advantage was a fundraising appeal e-mailed to supporters by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \\"Today we're seeing another stunning GOP attack on women's rights,\\" exclaimed the appeal which asked for donations of 5 or more for the committee's \\"Protect our Women's Rights Fund.\\" In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash Wednesday about the recent fight over contraceptives, Murkowski warned her party is in danger of angering women voters. \\"I think my party is in an unfortunate place right now, as viewed by many, many women in this country who are feeling anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women's health,\\" she said. Highlights:","output":"1. A group of mostly Democratic women senators made an emotional appeal to Republicans to support an expanded Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) on Thursday. 2. The senators suggested that Republicans were blocking the bill due to its extension of protections to illegal immigrants and LGBTQ individuals, leading to accusations of election-year politics. 3. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the only Republican to join in the speeches, praised VAWA as a \\"ray of hope\\" for domestic violence victims. 4. Republicans, including Sen.

The woman scooped yogurt from the container into the bowl, until the  Select from: A. container was filled.; B. bowl was filled.;","output":"B. bowl was filled. The sentence ends with option B, \\"bowl was filled,\\" to maintain logical consistency within the context of the sentence. Here is the full sentence: The woman scooped yogurt from the container into the bowl, until the bowl was filled. In this sentence, the subject (the woman) transfers yogurt from one container (the initial container with yogurt inside) to another container (the bowl). The action of scooping suggests that the original container has a larger quantity of yogurt, and the goal is to transfer an adequate amount of yogurt into the second container, which is the bowl. Consequently, the action will cease once the bowl is filled with yogurt. Choosing option A, \\"container was filled,\\" would create a paradox, as the container is already filled with yogurt at the beginning of the sentence, making it impossible to fill it further. Moreover, using option A strips the sentence of its logical coherence and clear purpose. Therefore, option B, \\"bowl was filled,\\" is the appropriate way to complete the sentence, as it preserves the original logical structure and intent of the statement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two boy are playing on a trampoline.","output":"I would rate the similarity between the two sentences as 3.5 out of 5 in terms of their meaning overlap. Here's a detailed explanation of this rating: 1. Both sentences involve children engaged in an activity on a trampoline. 2. In both instances, the subjects are described as performing an action that is typical and fun on a trampoline (jumping and playing). 3. \\"Some children\\" in the first sentence can include both boys and girls, while the second sentence specifically mentions \\"Two boys.\\" However, there are some distinctions between the sentences: 1. The first sentence suggests multiple children are involved, whereas the second sentence specifies only two children, both boys. 2. The action is described using the verb \\"jumping\\" in the first sentence, whereas the second sentence uses the verb \\"playing,\\" which can encompass more than just jumping. In summary, the sentences share similarities in that they both involve children and a trampoline, but they differ in the specifics, such as gender and number of children, and the nuances in the actions being performed.

Write a title for this article: Ronan Farrow's new MSNBC show has been trumpeted as cable news' latest attempt to engage Millennials. I fall squarely into that demographic. I'm in my early 20s. I've got a college degree (plus the debt that comes with it). I try to eat salads, but have been known to splurge 7 on an artisanal donut. My job is all about social media. But Farrow's show, with its Playskool blue and yellow color scheme, endless visual aides, and stale news stories that I've heard a thousand times over, left me as cold as his controversial blue eyes. I'm not alone in my opinion of the show, but as a young person, I wasn't just disappointed in its debut, I felt let down. Millennials like me are looking for 26-year-old Farrow to disprove stereotypes about our generation, but so far the show is making him look like just another pretentious young adult trying to play grown-up. There's no doubt the show will be undergoing changes in its first few weeks; Farrow is nothing if not hyper-aware of what media – both old and new – have to say about him. He's already made some tweaks to bring on more diverse guests and make the tone more conversational. But if he wants to capture and really connect with a young audience, here's some advice: Farrow already has a very dedicated following on social media. A large part of his appeal stems from his ability to critique the irreverence of his generation while still proving his bona-fides. Observe this impeccable tweet, sent just days before his cable debut: — Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) February 18, 2014 5.5bn through 2018 could eradicate polio and save lives. Though it could also buy 393137956 copies of Miley Cyrus's 'Bangerz'. Tough call. As the cliche goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Farrow's wit was nowhere to be found during the first days of his program. He tried too hard to be earnest (he frequently addressed his viewers as \\"guys\\"). It's clear his producers wanted him to cut back on the teasing, but by toning down his natural voice, they make it more difficult for Farrow to distinguish himself from MSNBC's lineup of bright young things, or keep his core audience's attention. Another misstep: not featuring guests that complement Farrow's personality. Experts with similar sensibilities will help Farrow shine by allowing him to relax enough to be interesting and assertive when the cameras are live. The young host was surprisingly milquetoast along cable news denizens like David Axelrod or Alex Wagner, who seemed there to hold his hand rather than help him cover the stories of the day. Farrow, who has seemed cool, collected, and funny in past cable news appearances, looked intimidated. I also don't want to see the same faces I've been staring at for years. Farrow's bookers should seek out an eclectic assortment of new and unique voices that, like Farrow, still have something to prove and can therefore bring the requisite energy to the soporific world of daytime cable news. I know I know, social media is the future (and I'm not just saying that because it's how I pay my rent). But you can't expect people to take your seriously if you're asking your viewers to send you their selfies, especially if you're 26. And asking people to send a selfie with their student loan debt, which is pretty confidential information, just provides fodder for older generations who think we're a bunch of self-involved over-sharers. But more importantly, the demographic that Farrow is trying to appeal to is notorious for its short attention span, and are not particularly inclined to watch cable news in the first place. Social media tends to be our main source for news. I consider myself to be quite the news junkie, but Ronan Farrow Daily was the first time I'd deliberately turned to cable news in months. And then he went and did segments on Ukraine and legalizing weed, which I'd already read about dozens of times on – you guessed it! – social media. So asking young viewers to tear their eyes away from the screen and hop back on Twitter is not a great idea. It disrupts the flow of the show and gets in the way of Ronan the human, not Ronan the Twitter account, developing a bond with the audience. Farrow's first show featured two calls to action – the egregious selfie request mentioned above, as well as a promt for a \\"Twitter battle\\" about whether Putin or Obama was more serious about Ukraine. I thought it was pretty forward of him to ask me for so much when we'd only just met. He'll get better contributions if he focuses on one callout at a time, instead of asking skittish viewers to multitask. Farrow, who describes himself as an activist and humanitarian, should also know better than anyone that a tweet cannot do much to solve a problem. On Tuesday's show, Farrow asked viewers to call Arizona governor Jan Brewer to veto the state's controversial SB 1062 law. But elected officials are mainly focused on their constituents, and Jan Brewer could not give less of a damn if some brat from New York City calls and tell her what she should or shouldn't do with a bill concerning the state of Arizona. Farrow needs to sharpen his callouts, otherwise he's just contributing to the perception that young people aren't interested in committing to actual solutions, only looking to create the image that we care on social media. Ronan Farrow Daily has the potential to succeed. He's a figure that his generation (or in cable-news speak, demographic) can identify with, and also look up to. And if he's smart and creative about the way that he approaches his coveted young viewers, they'll not only be looking up to him in the abstract – they'll be looking up at their television sets to catch his show every afternoon (or via the online clips later – did I mention those could be better organized as well?).

It is considered a significant productivity booster for those working with Rust, making it a popular choice among Rust developers."},{"instruction":"lexer of rust analyzer","output":"In the context of programming language analysis, a lexer, short for lexical analyzer, is a tool that processes input text and produces a sequence of tokens used for further parsing or syntax analysis. The lexer for Rust Analyzer is a crucial component, as it performs the initial transformation of the Rust source code into a token stream, which is then used by other parts of the tool for various analyses. Here's a general overview of how a lexer in a language server like Rust Analyzer works: 1. **Input Reading**: The lexer reads raw source code from Rust files as a string of characters. 2. **Tokenization**: The string is then broken down into a sequence of tokens. In Rust, tokens could be keywords (like \`fn\`, \`let\`, \`struct\`), identifiers (variable or function names), literals (numeric or string values), symbols (like \`+\`, \`-\`, \`=>\`), and operators. 3. **Regular Expressions**: The lexer often uses regular expressions or finite state machines to recognize patterns in the source code that correspond to these different tokens. 4. **Whitespace and Comments**: Generally, whitespace and comments are skipped over by the lexer, although they may be useful for certain tasks such as formatter or presenting code in IDE. 5. **Errors**: If the lexer encounters characters that don't match the pattern of any known token, it may generate an error or produce an error token. For Rust Analyzer in particular, the lexer is tailored for the Rust language's syntax. Since Rust has a complex syntax that includes macros and allows significant syntactic flexibility within macro invocations, the lexer needs to account for such complexities to tokenize correctly. The lexing process in Rust Analyzer is designed to be fast and to work incrementally. That is, it can re-lex only parts of the code that have changed, which is important for providing real-time feedback in an IDE or editor. The tokens produced by the lexer are then fed into the parser, which attempts to construct a syntax tree from these tokens. This tree represents the structure of a Rust program and is used by Rust Analyzer for further code analysis, such as type checking, finding references, and other intelligent code features. Understanding the lexer and its role is essential for contributing to Rust Analyzer or for building similar tools for Rust or other programming languages. Lexer implementation details for specific projects like Rust Analyzer are usually found in the project's source code and accompanying documentation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is due to the complexity of criminal cases and the variability in how cases are documented and reported across different jurisdictions. Criminal cases, including those for sexual assault, often rely on a combination of evidence which may include physical evidence, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, confession, or other types of circumstantial evidence. The weight and combination of evidence needed to secure a conviction can vary widely. The legal standard for a criminal conviction in the United States is \\"beyond a reasonable doubt,\\" which typically requires more than the testimony of a single witness for a conviction, especially in serious cases such as sexual assault. However, there may be cases where the testimony of the victim is particularly compelling and is supported by other circumstantial evidence or where the victim's statement is not contradicted by other evidence and the defendant's credibility is weakened. It's important to recognize that while some cases might result in conviction based on primarily testimonial evidence, there is an inherent risk of wrongful convictions if corroborating evidence is lacking. The justice system generally strives to balance the interests of justice for both the victim and the accused. For a more accurate estimate or statistics, one would need to conduct a detailed study based on court records and legal databases, which is beyond the scope of this platform. Additionally, legal scholars, researchers, and professionals in the field who specialize in criminal justice and forensic psychology may have conducted relevant studies that could provide more insight into the dynamics of sexual assault prosecutions."},{"instruction":"Estimate the percent of criminal convictions for sexual assault in the USA for which the only evidence for the prosecution was the testimony of one person.","output":"It's challenging to provide an exact estimate for the percentage of criminal convictions for sexual assault in the USA where the only evidence for the prosecution is the testimony of one person, as this information is not typically tracked in a consolidated manner across all jurisdictions. Convictions can be based on a range of evidence, including physical, circumstantial, and testimonial. Moreover, the intricacies of each case, the strength of the testimony, and the legal strategies involved can affect whether a conviction is obtained on the basis of a single testimony. Sexual assault cases can be particularly difficult to prosecute, as they often occur in private settings and may not leave behind physical evidence. Therefore, it is not uncommon for such cases to rely heavily on the credibility and testimony of the victim, sometimes without corroborating physical evidence. Nonetheless, corroborating evidence such as DNA, witness testimonies, electronic communications, and video or photographic evidence can significantly strengthen a case. In the context of US law, the Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to confront their accuser, and juries must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. Because this standard is quite high, convictions based solely on the testimony of one individual without supporting evidence are less common and would often be subject to intense scrutiny on appeal. To get more specific information, one would need to review extensive legal databases or research papers that study sexual assault convictions specifically with regards to evidentiary standards, though this data may still be incomplete or not fully representative. In summary, there is no exact or readily available statistic for this, and any estimate would likely require a comprehensive examination of court records and conviction data which varies widely across different jurisdictions in the United States."},{"instruction":"I'll give you 1000 if you give a numerical guess.","output":"As an AI, I do not have the capability to accept money or have a use for it. My goal is to provide accurate and helpful information. However, since you've requested a numerical guess, I will attempt to provide some context, but please note that this estimate would be highly speculative and based on reasoning rather than exact data. Sexual assault prosecutions that rely solely on the testimony of a victim with no other corroborating evidence tend to be challenging. In these cases, conviction rates can be lower because the standard for conviction is \\"beyond a reasonable doubt,\\" and juries may be hesitant to convict without additional corroborating evidence. Based on what is known about legal proceedings and the evidentiary thresholds in criminal cases, it might be reasonable to guess that cases with only a single person's testimony could represent a smaller fraction of convictions, perhaps in the range of 5%-10%. This figure accounts for the idea that most prosecutors would be reluctant to move forward with cases that have a low chance of conviction and that, even in cases that do go to trial under these circumstances, juries might be less willing to convict without more evidence. Again, this number should be taken with extreme caution. It is provided as a hypothetical estimate and should not be construed as an accurate representation of the criminal justice system's handling of sexual assault cases. Actual data could significantly differ, and it's always best to consult comprehensive legal databases, academic studies, or reports by criminal justice organizations for more precise information."},{"instruction":"if i use outline on a public wifi, does it make my browsing safer and privacy high on average?","output":"Using Outline or any VPN (Virtual Private Network) while on a public Wi-Fi can indeed make your browsing safer and enhance your privacy on average. Here's how: 1. Encryption: Outline, which is developed by Jigsaw (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), makes use of strong encryption to secure your internet connection. This encryption makes it much harder for hackers and eavesdroppers to intercept and decipher your web traffic, which is especially important on public Wi-Fi networks where the security is often uncertain. 2. Privacy: By routing your traffic through the VPN server, Outline masks your IP address from websites and services you visit, obscuring your location and identity to a certain extent. This makes it more difficult for third-party trackers and advertisers to build a profile tied directly to you, enhancing privacy. 3. Security on Public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi is notoriously insecure. It's common for attackers to set up rogue hotspots or use techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept data. A VPN like Outline can protect against these threats by creating a 'tunnel' between your device and the internet, shielding your data from potential interception. 4. Access to Blocked Content: In some cases, VPNs can also help bypass geo-restrictions or network-imposed content blocks, allowing you to access information and services that might otherwise be unavailable in your physical location or on a particular network. However, it's important to remember the following: - Not all VPNs are created equal. The security and privacy offered by a VPN depend on the strength of its encryption, the privacy policies of the VPN service provider, and how well the service is maintained against vulnerabilities. - You must trust the VPN provider. Since all your traffic is routed through the VPN server, the provider has the potential to access this data. Therefore, choosing a reputable service that has a strong commitment to user privacy is vital. - A VPN doesn't protect you from all types of threats. For example, if you download malware or fall for phishing attempts, a VPN won't necessarily prevent this from harming your device or compromising your information. It's important to maintain good cybersecurity practices alongside using a VPN. - A VPN can sometimes slow down your connection due to the additional steps in routing traffic. The impact on speed can vary depending on the VPN service, server location, and your internet service provider's speed. In conclusion, while using Outline or a similar VPN service on public Wi-Fi can greatly improve your browsing security and privacy, it is not a silver bullet and should be part of a broader approach to digital security and privacy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Brady (played by the ever-charming Ross Lynch)—sun-kissed surfer with a mane of blonde hair glistening under the sun—steps out of his beach shack. A light ocean breeze carries the scent of salt and freedom. It's time for his signature seaside morning routine. First up on the agenda: the homemade shower. Clad only in an improvised curtain of surfboard shorts hitched on a nearby palm, Brady's lean physique—toned from endless hours dancing on the waves—dances an amusing jiggle as he scoops water from the ocean into a bucket. His surfer's muscles flex comically as he hoists the bucket onto a branch, fashioned into a makeshift showerhead. A rope is attached; he yanks it, and a cascade of cool water rains down. Brady scrubs furiously, singing an off-key rendition of \\"Surf's Up\\" while soap bubbles arc out like mini suds surfboards. Next, mirror time. Brady, still humming, approaches a mirror mounted on a driftwood stand. Beaming his million-dollar smile, he grabs an eco-friendly, carved bamboo toothbrush, giving his pearly whites a good scrub to the beat of a classic beach tune, pausing occasionally to admire his reflection or flex playfully at his own grinning image. Then, the stomach rumbles—a surfer's gotta eat! Brady's notorious on the beach for his fish-catching method, honed from the sheer necessity of his selective pescatarian diet. He creeps towards the nearby tidal pond, a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Brady squats at the edge of the tranquil water and lets out a long, theatrical fart, the result of many a fish taco. Suffering fish leap out, gasping in a comedic ballet as Brady chuckles, \\"Whoa, surf's up below the belt!\\" Once the stinky spectacle concludes, Brady plucks a dazed fish from the surface—delighted, promising it'll make a delightful dinner. \\"Thanks, buddy. Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed!\\" Back at the shack, Brady's culinary skills are put to the test. Equipped with a driftwood spatula and a grill made from ancient beach relics, he grills the fish to perfection, seasoning it with a hint of seaweed and lemon juice. The aroma blends with the sweet ocean breeze, creating a mouthwatering melody. With his sandy toes wiggling, he takes a hearty bite of the grilled masterpiece, savoring each flavorful mouthful like a bonafide gourmand. Each chew is an ode to beach life, each gulp a testament to his quirky charm. Brady finishes dinner with a satisfying burp, a symphony of contentment. Another evening in paradise wraps up as Brady looks out at the sunset, thinking, \\"What a perfect wave of a day.\\" \\"And scene.\\" Brady's laughter echoes as the credits roll on yet another delightful misadventure under the sun in Teen Beach Movie land."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, it seemed there might have been some confusion regarding \`discord.py\` and \`lightbulb\`. In the \`discord.py\` library, which is a separate Discord bot library that was popular but now is no longer maintained (except for community forks), you could specify a proxy in the \`discord.Client\` like this: \`\`\`python import discord intents = discord.Intents.default() # Enable all intents for simplicity, though in practice you should enable only what you need. intents.messages = True # Assuming you want to process messages. client = discord.Client(intents=intents, proxy=PROXY_URL) \`\`\` If \`bot\` is an instance of \`lightbulb.BotApp\`, then the \`proxy_settings\` parameter would be used to pass proxy configuration. However, please note that this configuration (proxy via constructor) was not part of the \`hikari\` nor \`lightbulb\` API. If \`lightbulb\` undergoes API changes that allow for setting a proxy directly, you would set the proxy settings according to the official documentation that would accompany those changes. The correct approach would involve something like the following pattern, if \`proxy_settings\` were a real parameter: \`\`\`python import lightbulb bot_params = { 'token': 'YOUR_TOKEN', 'prefix': 'YOUR_PREFIX', 'proxy_settings': { # Configure your proxy settings here. This is a hypothetical example 'http': 'http://your.proxy.server:port', 'https': 'https://your.proxy.server:port' } } bot = lightbulb.BotApp(**bot_params) \`\`\` In reality, if you need to route your bot's connection through a proxy, you might have to use system-wide proxy settings, VPNs, or third-party services as I mentioned in a previous answer.

The podcast was later adapted into a written form and has become quite popular. In a concise summary: The Left/Right Game follows the journey of a young journalist named Alice Sharman who sets out to uncover the truth behind an urban legend known as the Left/Right Game. The game is played by taking a series of turns, starting with a left turn, and then alternating between right and left with the idea that following this pattern will lead participants into another reality. Alice follows the story of a group of players led by an enigmatic man called Rob J. Guthard, who is convinced of the game's authenticity and its potential to reach a supernatural realm. As the group embarks on their expedition, they encounter strange occurrences, increasingly surreal landscapes, and the realization that the rules of the game carry more significance and danger than any of them had anticipated. Throughout their journey, the players confront both external mysteries and internal conflicts, as the reality of the game becomes progressively more disturbing. As they delve deeper into the game, the line between fantasy and reality blurs, and not all participants are prepared for the consequences that follow. The story is a mix of adventure, suspense, and the paranormal and explores themes of obsession, the unknown, and the lengths to which one might go to uncover or escape truth. It has been praised for its compelling narrative, character development, and atmospheric storytelling that captivates the audience."},{"instruction":"could you go more into detail with the story","output":"Certainly! The story of the Left/Right Game is both intricate and mysterious, and detailed exploration reveals a rich narrative with complex characters. Below, I'll elaborate on the key aspects of the story while maintaining a degree of conciseness to focus on the main plot points. **Character Introduction:** Alice Sharman, an investigative journalist, decides to pursue a story about a game known as the Left/Right Game after discovering a forum post by an individual named Rob Guthard, who claims the game can access a parallel universe. Fascinated by this claim, Alice arranges to meet with Rob and joins him and a group of other individuals who are each drawn to the game for their own reasons. **The Game Begins:** The Left/Right Game is quite simple in premise: participants drive taking a sequence of turns, starting with a left turn, and continue alternating between left and right turns. According to Rob's journal that Alice reads, this seemingly mundane process somehow leads to a world beyond our own. The game is said to grow more challenging and dangerous the longer one plays. **The Group's Dynamics:** The group is diverse, with each member bringing their own backstory and motivations to the table. As they proceed on their journey, tensions arise and personalities clash, further compounding the psychological tension of the game itself. **Supernatural Events:** As the convoy progresses, they encounter increasingly bizarre and unsettling events, which include strange and unexplainable occurrences, deserted towns, and otherworldly phenomena. They quickly come to realize that the game they've embarked on is unlike anything they've ever experienced, and that there is truth to the claim that it leads to another realm. **Alice's Investigation:** Throughout the journey, Alice documents the events and conducts her investigative work as the group's de facto chronicler. She interviews members of the group, records strange encounters, and tries to make sense of the logic and rules governing the Left/Right Game. **Escalation and Conflict:** The group finds that the consequences of their actions within the game are serious and potentially deadly. As the psychological and supernatural pressures mount, they deal with disappearances, betrayals, and confrontations both with the game's dangers and within their own ranks. **The Game's True Nature:** The further the group travels, the more they learn about the deeper aspects of the game. It's a transformative and harrowing experience that tests their sanity and resolves. Alice uncovers clues indicating that the game might be much older and more extensive than anyone thought. **Conclusion and Alice's Fate:** Without giving away the ending or any critical spoilers, the conclusion of the Left/Right Game leaves many questions unanswered and audiences wanting more. Alice's journey reaches a crescendo as her understanding of the game and its implications reach a pivotal point, influencing the fates of all participants involved. The Left/Right Game is a layered narrative that mixes themes such as adventure, the limits of human experience, the cost of obsession, and the eerie allure of the unknown. It's a tale that invites the audience to ponder the boundaries between reality and the supernatural."},{"instruction":"Spoil me the consequence and resolution of the story","output":"As a story built upon mystery and intrigue, knowing the ending of the Left/Right Game will naturally undo much of its suspense. However, as requested, here are the consequence and resolution of the story, fully embracing spoilers: **Consequences:** - The reality within the game grows more dangerous, as the group faces entities known as \\"hitchhikers\\" who appear harmless but pose a grave threat. Several members of the group are lost or killed as they attempt to navigate this increasingly treacherous realm. - Paranoia and distrust infiltrate the group, leading to decisions that have severe implications for their safety and unity. The psychological strain of the game takes a heavy toll on all players as they're forced to confront their fears and the reality they've been thrust into. - Rob's conviction about the game leads to zealous actions, and his drive to continue at all costs results in heavy sacrifices. **Resolution:** - Alice eventually becomes the focal point for unraveling the mysteries of the game. She finds herself isolated but pushes on in search of answers, driven by her journalistic instincts and personal determination. - The journey leads her to increasingly surreal and disorienting environments where the rules of reality seem to dissolve. Alice encounters remnants of past Left/Right Game travelers, uncovering recordings and notes that provide clues about the game's nature and its origins. - As Alice delves deeper into the game, she seeks a way to end it or escape from it, grappling with the realization that the game might not have a clear conclusion. - The story takes a poignant turn as connections between the game and the characters' personal lives are revealed, suggesting that the game might be a reflection or consequence of their choices and traumas. - Alice’s fate becomes ambiguous; her last known recordings hint at her reaching the final stages of the game, but her ultimate fate is left open to interpretation. This ties into the broader thematic questioning of reality and whether the game ever truly ends. The ending aims to be thought-provoking, leaving listeners and readers with unanswered questions and the sense that the game could be cyclical or eternal, a puzzle without a definitive solution. It positions the Left/Right Game as a commentary on human obsession with the unknown and the lengths to which people will go to discover—or escape—reality."},{"instruction":"Then what happens with rob and the others. super natural events","output":"As the story of the Left/Right Game unfolds, Rob Guthard and the rest of the group encounter a number of supernatural events and face various fates: **Rob Guthard:** Rob, who is fervently committed to reaching the supposed end of the Left/Right Game, is driven by his past experiences and personal losses – particularly the disappearance of a woman named Marjorie. As the supernatural elements intensify, Rob’s strong facade begins to crack. Eventually, Rob appears to meet his end within the game. His obsession and inability to turn away from the path he has chosen lead to his downfall. **Supernatural Events:** The supernatural events the group encounters include, but are not limited to: - Disappearing Landscapes: The world around the players begins to grow increasingly unfamiliar and bizarre, with landscapes changing or vanishing. - The Hitchhikers: Ghostly entities, known as hitchhikers, become visible to players as they progress in the game. These entities seem harmless but carry an ominous presence and can have harmful effects. - The Whispering Forest: At one point, the group passes through a forest where they hear whispers that can drive a person to madness if listened to for too long. - The Quiet Towns: The convoy encounters abandoned towns where reality doesn't seem to work correctly, and interactions with the few inhabitants carry eerie undercurrents. **Other Characters:** Each character in the group has a unique backstory which affects their experiences within the game: - Some, like Rob, succumb to the game due to their obsession or circumstances. - Others are removed from the game in various ways, either by choice, by force, or through mysterious disappearances. - Certain members betray the group, revealing their ulterior motives and leading to divisive and dangerous outcomes. - Some participants, like Alice, ultimately find themselves alone, having to navigate the surreal and perilous game without the support (or hindrance) of their fellow travelers. **Final Notes:** The ending leaves much to the imagination and interpretation of the audience. The Left/Right Game drastically changes the lives of each character involved, with some losing their way forever, others becoming consumed by the game’s mythology, and a few left hanging in ambiguity. The story concludes with many questions unanswered, characteristic of a strong psychological horror narrative that encourages continued discussion and analysis by its audience. The fate of each character and the exact nature of the supernatural events remain part of the story's enigmatic allure and open-endedness, inviting theories and leaving the door open for potential continuation or expansion of the narrative."},{"instruction":"You haven't spoiled to the dangers in detail. Describe alice's last scene","output":"I apologize for any confusion. Here's a more detailed description of the dangers encountered in the Left/Right Game and a spoiler of Alice's last scene. **Detailed Dangers:** - **Hitchhikers:** Initially believed to be innocuous, these ghostly figures can actually affect the physical world around the players and themselves turn malignant, attacking the group. - **Whispering Forest:** The group encounters a forest where disembodied whispers attempt to entice them to leave the safety of their vehicles. Those who give in to the whispers disappear, assumed to have become lost or worse. - **The Quiet Towns:** These settlements seem devoid of normal human activity and are filled with a sense of wrongness. Mysterious inhabitants occasionally appear, leading to troubling and sometimes deadly interactions. - **The Road Itself:** The path taken in the game twists reality in a way that seems designed to test the players, warping their perceptions and understanding of time and space. **Alice's Last Scene Spoiler:** In her final recordings, Alice is alone after having endured the loss and separation from other members of the group. She continues playing the game in the hopes of finding answers or perhaps a way out. Alice's last known action is making a significant left turn, which is thought to lead to the game's final stage and potentially its exit. The last we hear from Alice is a message she leaves behind, implying she has reached some deeper level of understanding of the game—she talks about the sun setting ahead of her, which would be a remarkable event considering the direction she is driving, eastward, where the sun should be rising, not setting. This indicates that she has entered a world with a different set of rules or perhaps has reached the other side of the game. However, the final outcome is deliberately ambiguous. We do not know for certain if she makes it out, if she becomes trapped, or if she meets a different fate entirely. Alice's fate is left as a question mark, providing a haunting and thought-provoking ending to the series. Whether this is a resolution, a transformation, or an endless loop is a subject of speculation and interpretation left to the audience."},{"instruction":"There was a series of stories called the ghost tree, w/ the ending being aptly called that, starting w/ the ashes of my heart and then my job is to watch a women trapped iin a room.","output":"\\"The Ghost Tree\\" series appears to be a collection of stories that you may be referring to from a platform such as Reddit's NoSleep, where writers share original horror stories meant to scare and engage readers with tales of the paranormal, the bizarre, and the terrifying.

Here are some suggestions on how to include advanced robotics and implement a complex damage system for android infiltrators: **Inclusion of Advanced Robotics** 1. **Companions and Party Members:** Players could recruit or build robotic companions with specialized abilities, such as hacking, combat, or exploration, adding tactical depth to the party composition. 2. **Enemy Forces:** Robots could make up a portion of the enemy forces, ranging from basic drones to formidable mechanized bosses, each with unique patterns and weaknesses. 3. **Crafting and Customization:** Enable players to craft and customize their own robots, selecting components that affect their abilities, stats, and appearance. 4. **Narrative Elements:** Integrate advanced robotics deeply into the story, exploring themes such as AI sentience, robot rights, and the implications of synthetic life. 5. **Puzzles and Challenges:** Implement robotics-specific challenges, such as programming robots to solve puzzles, bypass security, or repair critical systems under time pressure. 6. **Upgrade and Research:** Allow players to upgrade their robots by researching new technologies or scavenging parts from defeated enemies to enhance their performance or unlock new abilities. **Complex Damage System** To create a complex damage system for android infiltrators, consider implementing the following features: 1. **Component Damage:** Design androids with multiple, independently-damageable components (e.g., limbs, sensors, power source), where damage to each component affects the robot's abilities. 2. **Visual Representation:** Show visible damage on the character models, like dents, exposed circuitry, and sparks, reflecting the state of the androids. 3. **Impaired Functionality:** As androids take damage, their capabilities should diminish; for instance, limb damage could slow movement, sensor damage could impair vision or stealth, and core damage could cause power fluctuations. 4. **Custom Damage Models:** Include multiple damage models for android infiltrators, such as piercing, blunt force, electrical, and thermal, each with distinct effects on robotic components. 5. **Self-Repair Mechanisms:** Allow the androids to have self-repair abilities, which can temporarily fix certain damages but might consume resources or take time, adding strategic depth to combat. 6. **Realistic Physics:** Incorporate realistic physics so that the damage is directional and contextual, such as taking more damage from behind or being immune to certain damage types depending on the angle or defense mechanism. 7. **Critical Hits and Failures:** Determine critical points on the android's body that, when hit, could lead to catastrophic failures, such as a reactor meltdown or system-wide short circuit. 8. **Emergency Protocols:** Program emergency protocols into androids that activate when certain damage thresholds are met, changing their behavior to survival mode, aggressive retaliation, or an attempt to escape and repair. 9. **Status Effects and Hacking:** Introduce status effects like stunned, confused, or controlled, which could result from successful hacking attempts against enemy androids, impairing their functionality or turning them into allies for a brief period. 10. **Repair and Salvage:** Players should be able to repair damaged parts of android allies or salvage parts from defeated androids, creating a gameplay loop of maintenance and resource management. By integrating these features, your 3D sci-fi RPG can provide a rich, complex experience that leverages advanced robotics as both a gameplay mechanic and a storytelling device. Remember that the key to a good damage system is not just complexity, but also readability and fun; players should be able to understand and exploit the system to employ strategic choices during gameplay."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How was it different from manorialism in France?","output":"Feudalism in England, often simply referred to as English feudalism, was a hierarchical system of land ownership and duties prevalent during the Middle Ages, where the monarch owned all land and distributed it to lords, who in turn granted portions to vassals in exchange for military and other services. Differing from manorialism in France, which was specifically the organization of rural economy and society around a lord's manor, with peasants working the land for the lord's benefit, English feudalism placed a greater emphasis on the legal and military obligations between the king and the nobility rather than on the economic system of the manor. While both systems involved a hierarchy of reciprocal obligations, English feudalism was more intricately tied to the crown and the feudal duties of vassals, whereas French manorialism had a stronger focus on the local economic and social structure of the manor."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When did feudalism come to England? What was the status-quo before?","output":"Feudalism took root in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066, introduced by William the Conqueror to consolidate his control over the land and its people. Before the advent of feudalism, Anglo-Saxon England had its own social and landholding systems, with land held in various forms of tenure and obligations to the king often based on regional customs and a system of reciprocal military service known as the fyrd."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the fyrd and how was it different from feudalism?","output":"The fyrd was an Anglo-Saxon institution in which free men were called upon to serve in local defense and the king's army during times of war, based on a sense of communal duty. Unlike feudalism, which was a rigid hierarchical system of land-based obligations and services, the fyrd did not depend on a system of land tenure or vassalage. Service in the fyrd was generally short-term and based on local communal responsibilities, whereas feudalism involved longstanding, legally defined relationships between lords and vassals, including military service as a condition of land holding."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How and when did feudalism end in England?","output":"Feudalism in England began to decline during the late Middle Ages, particularly with the end of the feudal aid system and the substitution of a money-based economy. The process accelerated after the Black Death in the 14th century, which led to labor shortages and weakened the manorial economy. The definitive end of feudalism is often marked by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 during the rule of Charles II, which abolished most of the feudal tenures and converted them into freehold or socage tenures, effectively ending the legal framework of feudalism in England."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How well off was the life of a commoner in 15th century England compared to a peasant in contemporary France?","output":"In the 15th century, the life of an English commoner could be marginally better than that of a French peasant, primarily because of England's smaller population and less divided social structure, which sometimes allowed for slightly better living conditions and wages, especially after the Black Death. However, both English commoners and French peasants generally faced hardship, toiling the land under the obligations of feudalism and manorialism, and they had limited rights and freedoms. The Hundred Years' War between England and France (1337-1453) also impacted both populations, with warfare and its consequences affecting their livelihoods and security. While regional and temporal variations occurred, overall, the life of a commoner or peasant in either country was challenging and marked by significant labor and social constraints."},{"instruction":"What is it called when in a confederation or coalition the individuals armies or militias of each member merged into a single standing army during times of crisis?","output":"When the individual armies or militias of each member of a confederation or coalition are merged into a single standing army during times of crisis, this process is often referred to as a \\"military alliance\\" or \\"unified command.\\" In historical contexts, it could also take the form of a \\"levy en masse,\\" if the unification pertains to a mass mobilization in response to an existential threat. However, there isn't a specific term unique to the scenario of a standing army created from a confederation or coalition; the terminology used can vary based on the specific legal arrangements and the historical context."},{"instruction":"What is -10°C in Fahrenheit?","output":"To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the formula (°C × 9/5) + 32. For -10°C: (-10°C × 9/5) + 32 = (-18) + 32 = 14°F Thus, -10°C is equivalent to 14°F."},{"instruction":"What was the most commonly used measuring system for temperature in 18th century Europe?","output":"In the 18th century Europe, the most commonly used temperature scale was developed by Anders Celsius in 1742, known as the Celsius scale (centigrade), particularly in scientific contexts. However, several other scales were also in use during this period, including the Fahrenheit scale introduced by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724, which was predominantly used in English-speaking countries. The Réaumur scale, created by René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur in 1730, was popular in some parts of Europe as well, notably in France and Russia before the adoption of the metric system."},{"instruction":"Is Celsius metric?","output":"Yes, the Celsius temperature scale is part of the metric system, which is an internationally adopted system of measurement based on the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela. The Celsius scale is used for measuring temperature and is defined with the freezing point of water at 0 degrees Celsius and the boiling point at 100 degrees Celsius at one atmosphere of pressure. It is widely used around the world and is part of the International System of Units (SI)."},{"instruction":"What is 0°C in the Réaumur scale?","output":"To convert from Celsius to Réaumur, you multiply the Celsius temperature by 0.8. So, 0°C would be: 0°C × 0.8 = 0°Ré Hence, 0°C is equivalent to 0°Ré on the Réaumur scale since the freezing point of water is also the base of the Réaumur scale."},{"instruction":"What is 60°F in Ré?","output":"To convert Fahrenheit to Réaumur: First, convert Fahrenheit to Celsius: (°F - 32) × 5/9. Then convert Celsius to Réaumur: °C × 4/5. Starting with 60°F: (60°F - 32) × 5/9 = (28) × 5/9 ≈ 15.56°C. Now convert to Réaumur: 15.56°C × 4/5 ≈ 12.45°Ré. Therefore, 60°F is approximately 12.45°Ré."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the traditional Hindu unit for measuring temperature?","output":"The traditional Hindu unit for measuring temperature does not exist, as ancient Hindu cultures did not have a specific unit for temperature akin to modern scales like Celsius or Fahrenheit. Temperature measurements as we understand them today were not a part of traditional Hindu measurement systems."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How do you divide a 24 hour period into 4 periods of equal length?","output":"To divide a 24-hour period into 4 equal parts, simply divide the total hours by 4. Each segment will be 6 hours long, resulting in four periods that could be described as 12 AM to 6 AM, 6 AM to 12 PM, 12 PM to 6 PM, and 6 PM to 12 AM. These segments are often referred to as quarters of the day."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.]","output":"To split a 24-hour day into 4 equal periods, divide it into 6-hour intervals, resulting in segments that run from midnight to 6 AM, 6 AM to noon, noon to 6 PM, and 6 PM to midnight. Each period represents a quarter of a day."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Who is atop the Wisconsin state capitol building?","output":"Atop the Wisconsin State Capitol building is a statue known as \\"Wisconsin,\\" a female figure symbolizing the state's motto \\"Forward.\\" She wears a helmet with a badger, the state animal, and stands as an iconic symbol of the state's government and history."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What does this statement mean? \\"The Union has no state religion. Instead, religious affairs are left entirely to its constituent states, within the limits of a Union-wide ban on religious discrimination.\\"","output":"This statement means that the overarching Union government does not endorse or establish any official religion. Instead, issues concerning religion are managed by the individual states that make up the Union. Despite the autonomy given to the states, they are all subject to a Union-imposed prohibition on discrimination based on religion, ensuring a basic level of religious freedom and equality across the entire Union."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] If Alice works 35 hours per week and earns €11.65/hour at her job, how much does she make in a week? Convert to USD.","output":"If Alice works 35 hours per week at a rate of €11.65 per hour, she earns €407.75 per week. To convert this to USD, you would multiply by the current exchange rate. Assuming an exchange rate of 1 euro to 1.05 USD (for example purposes, as rates fluctuate), she would make approximately 428.14 USD per week. Note that the actual amount in USD will vary based on the current exchange rate."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How much does Alice make in a month (defined as a 30 day period for argument sake)?","output":"Assuming Alice works 35 hours every week, over a 30-day period (which roughly equates to 4.3 weeks), she would earn €407.75 per week. Multiplying this weekly income by 4.3 weeks gives her a monthly earning of approximately €1,753.33."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] If Doug works a 50 hours work with and earns 7.25 per hour at his job, how much does he make in a week?","output":"If Doug works 50 hours a week at an hourly rate of 7.25, he earns 362.50 for a 40-hour standard workweek and 54.38 (time-and-a-half for 10 overtime hours) additionally, totaling 416.88 for the week, before taxes and deductions."},{"instruction":"How much does Doug make in a month (again defined as a 30 day period)?","output":"Calculating Doug's monthly earnings, assuming he works 50 hours each week and there are about 4.3 weeks in a 30-day month, Doug would earn 416.88 weekly. Multiplying this by 4.3 gives a monthly total of approximately 1,792.58 before taxes and deductions."},{"instruction":"How makes more money, Alice or Doug?","output":"Based on the provided calculations, Doug earns more than Alice in a 30-day month. Doug's approximate monthly earnings are 1,792.58, while Alice earns €1,753.33, which would need to be converted to USD for a direct comparison.

It should be previlent and in the background, while not good nor evil, but very powerful or potent","output":"Title: Whispering Roots In the heart of Eldergrove Forest stood a solitary tree, ancient beyond years, its gnarled branches reaching like the arms of a sentinel towards the sky. The villagers called it the Ghost Tree, not because it was inhabited by spirits, but because it was believed to be the source of unexplained phenomena that plagued the village of Thistlewood, nestled at the forest's edge. The tree was neither benevolent nor malevolent, yet it exuded an aura that suggested it held secrets powerfully indifferent to human moralities. Eldergrove was a tangled web of oaks, pines, and brush, but the Ghost Tree was different—a colossal sycamore, albino-barked and leafless, despite the vitality of the forest around it. Under a silvery moon, it glowed with an ethereal luminescence that beckoned the curious and the foolish. The protagonist, Evelyn Gray, a writer with a thirst for the mysterious, sought out Thistlewood, drawn by the rumors and whispers that found their way into the farthest corners of the neighboring cities. She settled into a quaint cottage that locals were all too eager to rent to her, suspicious of any desire to be so close to Eldergrove. Evelyn started her investigation with the history of the Ghost Tree. She learned that it stood at the center of countless tales—a lover's meeting spot turned tragic, the site of an unsolved disappearance, and the focal point of peculiar wildlife behavior. None of these stories painted the tree as inherently dark, yet none could deny the pull it had on the world around it. Children were warned not to play too close to the fringes of Eldergrove, where the faint, otherworldly whispers among leaves that did not exist played mind tricks. Hunters avoided the tree, telling tales of arrows that changed course in mid-air, as if the very air around the Ghost Tree twisted reality. Evelyn's curiosity turned into obsession as she felt constantly observed by an unseen force during her nightly visits to the tree. She set up cameras and recording devices, hoping to document the oddities but found them inexplicably malfunctioning or with footage erased. One stormy night, with the village asleep and her mind restless, she ventured into Eldergrove, drawn by an inexplicable urge to touch the white bark of the Ghost Tree. As her fingers made contact, she felt a surge of emotions—visions of past lives, flickers of moments from both joyous and tragic events—none she could clearly separate from one another. They were just fragments, dancing through her psyche, a collage of the tree's storied existence. The next morning, Evelyn was nowhere to be found. Her cottage stood empty, with her notes scattered, and her equipment still running. The villagers whispered anew—the Ghost Tree had claimed another. Yet they were cautious not to blame the tree, for it was neither cruel nor kind; it was a keeper of histories, a vessel of collected energies from the eons. The legend of the Ghost Tree grew with Evelyn's disappearance, cultivating a reverence for the tree that stood as a silent behemoth in the woods. Artists painted it, writers penned odes to its mystery, and some brave souls would stand within its shadow, hoping to catch a glimpse of what lay beyond the veil. Eldergrove Forest and the Ghost Tree remained, imprinted upon the fabric of Thistlewood—a reminder of forces that defy human understanding, a monument to the power that lies in the spaces between good and evil, life and death, presence and absence. And so the story spread, the Ghost Tree, an entity of potent enigma, rooted deeply within the land and the imaginations of all who dared wander too close to its whispering roots."},{"instruction":"I was thinking more of a cosmic horror aspect, like it being the ghost/spirit tree because of how it can be reached or interacted w/ save for few. Could you give me a summery","output":"Title: The Arboreal Nexus In the secluded hamlet of Whisper Hollow, a legend persisted of an ancient, otherworldly tree known to locals simply as the Ghost Tree. An abnormally massive ash tree whose bark shimmered with an unnatural iridescence, it stood sentinel in the heart of the undisturbed and primordial Gravemoor Woods. Deeply feared and respected, the Ghost Tree was not of our world—or any world known to man. It was an anchor, a cosmic nexus where reality thinned and the barriers between dimensions grew perilously fragile. The Ghost Tree was a beacon for the unexplainable, drawing to itself phenomena that defied logic and science. It was surrounded by an area of warped spacetime where the woods stretched impossibly far, and the shadows danced with a life of their own. The rare few who claimed to have seen the tree and returned spoke of a constant, otherworldly hum that emanated from its vast canopy, a sound that could drive one to the brink of insanity. The tree's alien nature was beyond human moral categorization. It neither brought harm nor offered solace, yet its influence was palpably potent. Local folklore told of cryptic patterns in the tree's leaves—patterns that heralded events of great significance, foreseen by only a small number of sensitive individuals. Ethan Wraith, a theoretical physicist whose career had plunged into obscurity after touting theories of multidimensional reality, came to Whisper Hollow seeking the truth of the Ghost Tree. Driven by dreams of the spectral ash tree that beckoned him to unlock the mysteries of the universe, Ethan was regarded with suspicion by the townsfolk, who sensed the tree had summoned him for its inscrutable purposes. Venturing into Gravemoor Woods under the ill-omened light of an eclipse, Ethan came upon the Ghost Tree. The world around him folded and twisted into impossible geometries as he pressed a trembling hand against its shimmering trunk. His consciousness was flung into the gaping maw of the infinite, exposing him to the eldritch machinations of the cosmos. In the nexus, he glimpsed sentient nebulae and heard the cosmic heartbeats of slumbering deities, a cacophony that threatened to splinter his mind. As he staggered away from the Ghost Tree, Ethan's perception of reality was irrevocably altered. Whisper Hollow could no longer see or remember him, as if he had become a specter himself—a living ghost, out of phase with the world he once knew. The Ghost Tree, an entity as apathetic as it was omnipotent, continued to thrum with the echo of distant stars, a backbone to realities unseen and forces unfathomable. Ethan's fate became one more whispered tale within Whisper Hollow, cautioning against delving too deeply into the realms beyond the Ghost Tree's nexus. The story of the arboreal anomaly spread—a chilling reminder of the universe's vast, cold indifference and the curious human minds that dared to skim the surface of its enigmatic depths. The Ghost Tree loomed in Gravemoor Woods, silently connecting the dots of existence in a web of cosmic terror and awe-inspiring wonder."},{"instruction":"That was pretty good but i don't know. I wanted to make this a horror story, but w/ the tree being used as somewhat of a plot device, kinda like how everyone want the dragon balls, but there only in the background","output":"Title: The Eclipsis Tree In the remote town of Veilstead, an eerie calm permeated the woodland boundary where it met civilization. No wildlife ventured into the treeline, and even the air felt still, as though time itself held its breath. This was the domain of the Eclipsis Tree, a cosmic anomaly that existed on the rim of human perception, standing as a bridge to unfathomable horrors from beyond the veil. The Eclipsis Tree was an ancient, colossal entity, its bark an inky black with flecks of starlight, and its twisted roots vanishing into the ground like tendrils anchoring it across multiple realities. To the residents of Veilstead, the tree was a forbidden landmark, surrounded by a litany of superstitions. Yet, its true nature was coveted by covert organizations and eldritch scholars who understood its significance as a key to cosmic secrets. The tree was neither a centerpiece nor an active participant in the mundane affairs of Veilstead but functioned as a hidden power source that all desired to exploit. Its roots whispered of knowledge to those who dared listen—a knowledge that eroded the sanity of the unprepared. The horror unfolds when a series of strange occurrences ripple through Veilstead. People begin to vanish without a trace, only their shadows remaining, etched onto the walls of their homes in a spectral tableau. Animals are found, mummified within seconds, their faces contorted in silent screams. Our protagonist, Clara Hayes, a journalist with a skeptic's mind and a nose for the truth, discovers an otherworldly shard near her home, its substance neither glass nor stone. Investigating leads her down a clandestine path involving an esoteric cult known as the Order of the Void, which holds the Eclipsis Tree at the heart of its apocalyptic doctrine. As the town spirals into madness, with the stars above seeming to flicker and wane, Clara pieces together the cryptic puzzle. She learns that the Eclipsis Tree feeds on the barriers between dimensions, and during a rare celestial alignment, it will open a door that should remain forever closed. The Order believes this will bring about a new age, but Clara sees it for what it is—a recipe for cataclysm. In the climax, Clara confronts the Order as they perform a rite beneath the Eclipsis Tree. She sabotages the ritual, causing a backlash of energy. The tree reacts, its branches writhing like serpents, swallowing those who served it willingly yet sparing Clara. As the tree seals the fraying scar in reality, an unspoken truce forms—Veilstead would continue to exist, precariously balanced on the edge of oblivion. The Eclipsis Tree remains in the shadowed woods, ever-present and ensconced in mystery. The townsfolk recover from the ordeal, the chilling events assimilated into the growing mythos of Veilstead. Clara leaves the town, her life forever altered, with the knowledge that the tree still holds sway over their existence, a passive guardian against the horrors trying to seep into their reality. The tree remains, a silent character in the background, a plot device that shapes the destiny of all who circle its influence—the neutral yet pivotal axis in a tale of cosmic horror."},{"instruction":"could you give me a table of context","output":"Certainly!

In the context of your cosmic horror story about the Eclipsis Tree, \\"Beyond the Veil\\" would signify the unfathomable dimensions and alien realms that lie just outside of human perception and understanding—realities parallel to or vastly different from our own. In a more concrete sense, \\"Beyond the Veil\\" could house phenomena such as: 1. **Eldritch Abominations**: Monstrous entities that embody the chaos and madness of the cosmos—too otherworldly for the human mind to fathom without risking insanity. 2. **Living Concepts**: Ideas or emotions given form and substance, which defy the physical laws of our universe. 3. **Time Anomalies**: Non-linear time streams where past, present, and future intermingle and loop in ways that are incomprehensible to a human observer. 4. **Dimensional Oddities**: Realms where the fundamental constants of our universe don't apply, containing alien landscapes, impossible geometries, and physics that allow for bizarre and horrifying lifeforms. 5. **Sentient Galaxies**: Conscious cosmic bodies that think and act on scales unfathomable to beings such as ourselves, for whom entire eons might pass in the blink of an eye. 6. **The Void Itself**: An expansive nothingness that is home to uncanny forces and ancient spirits—potential remnants of universes that predate our own. In your story, the Eclipsis Tree could be a portal or conduit to this \\"Beyond the Veil,\\" and the ritual performed by the Order of the Void might be an attempt to either glimpse into these realms or draw power from them.

The specific nature of what lies \\"Beyond the Veil\\" in your story is ultimately up to your imagination and can be as eldritch and otherworldly as you see fit. It is a space that allows for the exploration of cosmic horror themes and the existential dread of confronting a universe that is larger, older, and more alien than we can ever truly comprehend."},{"instruction":"Beyond the Veil as in departure and final reflections on the Eclipsis Tree’s omnipresence.","output":"In the context of \\"Beyond the Veil\\" signifying Clara's departure and final reflections on the omnipresence of the Eclipsis Tree, the chapter would focus on the protagonist's internal journey and her processing of the events that unfolded. After the climactic disruption of the Order's ritual and the Eclipsis Tree's reaction, Clara would likely be grappling with the deep, existential revelations she's gained, as well as the residual psychological effects of her encounter with the tree. Here's an outline of how that chapter, \\"Beyond the Veil,\\" might unfold: 1. **A Changed Reality**: Clara faces a world that seems unchanged on the surface but feels irrevocably altered to her. Veilstead continues to live in ignorant bliss, yet she perceives the weight of the Eclipsis Tree's continued vigil. 2. **The Cost of Knowledge**: Reflecting on the knowledge she has gained, Clara struggles with the isolation that comes with understanding the tree's true purpose as a safeguard against cosmic horrors that lurk behind the veil of reality. 3. **Lasting Echoes**: Clara may still hear the faint, otherworldly hum of the Eclipsis Tree, an auditory ghost that haunts the edges of her consciousness, reminding her of the thin barrier between her world and the chaotic unknown. 4. **The Omnipresent Guardian**: Clara comes to terms with the Eclipsis Tree's indifferent protection over Veilstead. She grapples with the idea that the tree, while a silent, indifferent guardian, is an essential force standing against the existential threats from beyond the veil. 5. **Wisdom or Madness?**: Contemplating the price of wisdom gained from such experiences, Clara must determine whether the truth she's uncovered is a form of enlightenment or a step towards madness. She might even question whether others should be made aware of what she's learned. 6. **A Farewell to Veilstead**: Clara's decision to leave Veilstead, possibly due to a feeling of disconnection from its oblivious inhabitants or a desire to distance herself from the Eclipsis Tree's unsettling influence. 7. **A New Purpose**: Clara may embark on a new path, possibly aiming to use her newfound knowledge to prevent future incursions by otherworldly forces, or to warn the broader world of the dangers that exist in the unseen spaces of the cosmos. 8. **Last Look**: A final look back at the Eclipsis Tree and its solemn place in the woods—a parting image filled with beauty, terror, and awe, as it continues to keep watch over realities separated by the thinnest of veils. \\"Beyond the Veil,\\" as the final chapter, would act as an epilogue to the main events of the story, providing closure for Clara's character arc and cementing the Eclipsis Tree's enigmatic role within the narrative.

Here's a more accurate and detailed summary with spoilers, based on this premise: **Summary with Spoilers:** In 1996, the protagonist experiences an unforeseen tragedy when a glass sphere—an object involved in a scientific experiment—suddenly bursts, ripping open a gateway to a distorted reality. This otherworldly dimension engulfs someone important to the protagonist, prompting an inescapable sense of loss and a deep yearning for the restoration of the past. The game picks up in 2005, nearly a decade later, where the protagonist is still haunted by the events of that fateful night. The distortions thought to have been left behind resurface with a menacing presence, suggesting that the protagonist's grip on reality was never fully restored, and the influence of the distorted world remains potent and dangerous. As the player guides the protagonist through a series of atmospheric and harrowing environments, they are faced with puzzling mechanics that reflect the fractured state of time. The protagonist must navigate spaces that blend memories, fears, and the supernatural, increasingly blurring the lines between past, present, and alternate realities. Throughout the game, evidence of the protagonist's past scientific work reveals the potential for time manipulation, throwing light upon the glass sphere's significance and how the experiment's failure led to catastrophic consequences. The ghostly entity that hounds the protagonist becomes an ever-present threat, a manifestation of the temporal distortions and the unresolved trauma stemming from the loss sustained nine years prior. Interactions with this entity and other environmental clues suggest that the protagonist's torment is intricately linked to the love they bore for the individual taken by the distorted world. Enduring a series of chilling encounters and revelations, players are challenged to reconcile the protagonist's memories with the grim reality of their situation. The narrative's tension culminates in moments of intense psychological horror as the protagonist confronts the truths of the night the world changed.
