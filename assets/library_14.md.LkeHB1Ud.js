Title: Would You Rather Movie plot: Iris, a young woman caring for her sick brother Raleigh, is unable to afford his treatment costs. Her brother's oncologist, Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a philanthropist, who offers her a deal: if she wins a parlor game at a dinner party, his charitable foundation will pay for Raleigh's leukemia treatment and locate a bone marrow donor for him immediately. Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts. The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, an elderly, paralyzed woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. A steak and fois gras dinner is served but, Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepherd then offers her 10,000 to compromise her principles, and so she eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers Conway 10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines he then offers him 50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the 50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch. After dinner ends, the game begins. Shepard reveals it to be a version of the party game \\"Would you rather...?\\", in which players must choose between two options. Shepard gives his guests the opportunity to leave without playing, but everyone stays. After Shepard's butler, a former MI5 agent named Bevans, wheels in an electric shock machine, the drunken Conway attempts to leave but is shot dead. Each contestant is then forced to choose between shocking themselves or another person. Each player has 15 seconds to make their choice. Iris, Cal and Lucas (after nodding his consent to Travis) shock themselves. All survive, and nobody is eliminated. In the second round, each contestant must choose between stabbing someone in the thigh with an ice pick or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok. Travis is singled out after insulting Julian in the previous round. In the second round the players are given 30 seconds...

Bipasha Basu (born 7 January 1979), also known by her married name Bipasha Basu Singh Grover, is an Indian film actress and model. Primarily known for her work in Hindi films, she has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and English language films. One of the most popular and highest-paid actresses in India, Basu is the recipient of numerous accolades, including one Filmfare Award, among six nominations. Particularly known for her work in the thriller and horror film genres, she is frequently cited in the media as a sex symbol. One of the judges of the Godrej Cinthol Supermodel Contest in which Basu participated, Vinod Khanna, wanted to launch her alongside his son Akshaye Khanna in Himalay Putra, but she felt she was too young and declined the role, which eventually went to Anjala Zaveri. After returning home, she was convinced by Jaya Bachchan to star opposite her son Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta's Aakhari Mughal. However, the film was cancelled, and Dutta instead changed the script and made Refugee with Kareena Kapoor. Basu was also offered a role in Refugee opposite Sunil Shetty, which she declined.  In 2001, Basu finally made her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in Vijay Galani's Ajnabee. The film, directed by Abbas-Mustan, was inspired by the American film Consenting Adults. It was a moderate box-office success and attracted unfavorable reviews from critics. However, Basu's performance in a negative role was appreciated by critics and won her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.  In 2002, Basu starred in the year's most successful thriller, Raaz. Directed by Vikram Bhatt, it established Basu in the Hindi film industry. Her portrayal of a woman who is pursued by a spirit received positive reviews. One review in The Tribune noted, \\"... it is Bipasha Basu who steals the show with her fine performance.\\" She was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Raaz. She was appreciated in a supporting role in Sanjay Gadhvi's Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai, a moderate critical and commercial success.

Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall, giving the audience advice on how to skip school, and to narrate about his friends. His younger sister Jeannie is less-convinced, but goes to school anyway. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney notes and suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. However, Ferris uses a computer to alter the school's records to indicate his absences from 9 to 2.

Leaving the car with two parking attendants, who promptly joyride it unknowingly to them, the trio visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Sears Tower, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Wrigley Field.

It was published seven months after the Church first indicated it is looking at ‘accommodations’ for same-sex couples and four months after the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, told Church leaders that ‘we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality.’ Archbishop Welby said yesterday that bishops will now ‘consider the report and decide how such a process might best be shaped.’ In its key paragraph the Pilling report declared: ‘We believe there can be circumstances where a priest, with the agreement of the parish, should be free to mark the formation of a permanent same-sex relationship in a public service but should be under no obligation to do so.’ Acknowledging arguments among the report team, it added: ‘Some of us do not believe that this can be extended to same-sex marriage.’ Current CofE guidance laid down by bishops forbids priests to conduct same-sex blessing services. Nevertheless, some estimates say 200 such services a year are carried out in Anglican churches. Bishops could permit gay blessing services simply by changing their guidelines. Their first opportunity to do so will come at meetings next month and in January. The Pilling report calls for two years of ‘facilitated conversations’ on a series of ideas that will sweep away the decades of opposition to gay rights if a majority in the Church accept them. Such talks may prove ‘difficult and divisive’ a statement by Archbishop Welby admitted. It called for the talks to end the rule dating from 1991 that says gays are welcome in the pews but that clergy must not be actively homosexual. ‘The Church’s present rules impose different disciplines on clergy and laity in relations to sexually active same-sex relationships,’ the report said. ‘It will be important to reflect on the extent to which laity and clergy should continue to observe such different disciplines.’ The report suggested that reforms might go ahead through bringing in different rules for junior clergy and for bishops - rules similar to those which currently allow women priests but not women bishops. The row over gay bishops has been toxic for the Anglicans since the last Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Williams, prevented the appointment of openly gay Canon Jeffery John as a bishop in 2003. Dr John is now Dean of St Albans. Under consideration: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the Church will now consider the recommendations. In a series of calls for new thinking, the report said the Church should show ‘real repentance for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past’. However, it added: ‘No-one should be accused of homophobia solely for articulating traditional Christian teaching on same-sex relationships.’ The report suggested that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality and said no-one should teach that it does. It also warned that liberal attitudes to homosexuality in western countries can cause trouble in countries where Christians are vulnerable to attack. Congregations in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan, where homosexuality is universally condemned by Muslims, have been subjected to violence in recent years. The report said: ‘It is important, for some a matter of life and death, that the Church and church people speak with great care and attentiveness to how their words will be received, not only in their own culture but in cultures where Christians are marginalised.’ The CofE set itself against the gay rights agenda in 1987, at a time when pressure for recognition of gay relationships by Anglicans was just beginning. Its parliament, the General Synod, said then that gay sex was sinful. Last year the Church strongly opposed David Cameron’s same-sex marriage legislation, saying it would wreck traditional marriage and undermine families. The Pilling report said that there should be no formal liturgy for same-sex blessing services, but consenting priests and parishes should be allowed to work out their own form of service. It hinted strongly that full acceptance of same-sex marriage is on the way. ‘A willingness to offer public recognition and prayer for a committed same-sex relationship would, in practice, be hard to implement now for civil partnerships without also doing so for same-sex marriage,’ it said. One member of the report team, the Bishop of Birkenhead, the Right Reverend Keith Sinclair, said he was unable to accept the recommendations. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This is an article about a report from the Church of England that says gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church. The report suggests that bishops should change their rules on ceremonies for gay and lesbian couples. This could lead to the church being more accepting of same-sex marriage and even having gay priests and bishops in the future. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the Church will now think about these recommendations. The report also says that everyone should be treated kindly, including those who believe in traditional Christian teachings on same-sex relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ).

Article:","output":"Title: Sture Bergwall's Murder Convictions: A Shocking Legal Tragedy Sparks Inquiry Into Legal System Shortfalls Sture Bergwall, a 63-year-old Swedish man, was convicted of eight murders between 1994 and 2001, despite the absence of any forensic evidence or witness testimonies to support the case. Over the years, Bergwall claimed to have killed 30 people, although he later recanted his confessions. Recently, he was released from a secure psychiatric unit, where he has been since 1991, sparking the government to launch an inquiry into potential flaws within the legal system. Understandably, many are troubled by the lack of concrete evidence that ultimately led to Bergwall's conviction. Despite not having any forensic evidence or witness statements, authorities were still able to convict Bergwall solely based on his confessions. Some speculate that Bergwall's fragile mental state at the time of his confession may have influenced the ease with which his admission of guilt was accepted, leading to questions being raised about how the legal system handles such cases. In light of the case, the Swedish government has initiated an inquiry to explore possible shortfalls within its legal system. The inquiry aims to examine and identify any weaknesses in the current system that could potentially allow such wrongful convictions to occur. The hope is that the findings of the inquiry will eventually lead to improvements within the legal framework, helping to prevent future instances of injustice. As for Sture Bergwall, his release from the secure psychiatric unit is a bittersweet victory. While he may have been released, the psychological impact of his wrongful conviction remains, and the damage done to his life can never be fully repaired. As the government continues its investigation, it is important to remember that the focus of the inquiry should not be solely on the errors within the legal system, but also on justice for victims like Bergwall. In conclusion, the case of Sture Bergwall serves as a stark reminder that the burden of proof must always be thoroughly scrutinized before a conviction can be made. The understanding and handling of evidence, particularly in cases where the defendant has a fragile mental state, should be held to the highest standards in order to avoid grave miscarriages of justice. It is with hope that the inquiry launched by the government will lead to substantial improvements in the Swedish legal system, protecting both the innocent and the guilty alike from experiencing another tragedy like that of Sture Bergwall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the second part of the sentence, the donkey is the subject, and the donkey is doing two things - carrying the boy (as indicated in the first part) and \\"carrying various items strapped to it\\". Here, 'various items' becomes the object that the donkey is carrying.  Now, let's look at the second sentence - \\"There is a donkey carrying things.\\" \\"The donkey\\" from the first sentence is equivalent to \\"a donkey\\" in the second sentence. \\"The donkey carrying various items\\" matches with \\"a donkey carrying things\\". There is no explicit information given about the boy in the second sentence, but the main idea behind both sentences is a donkey carrying items or things.  So, even though the second sentence does not provide as much detail as the first (it does not specify the exact quantity or nature of 'things', nor does it mention the boy), it is still true based on the information provided in the initial sentence.  Hence, it can be confirmed that based on the described scenario, the sentence \\"There is a donkey carrying things\\" is indeed accurate.  In essence, while the second sentence is a simplified version of the first one, it doesn't contradict or present any falsehood in relation to the first statement. It merely omits some of the details.

There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers:   USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016.  USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type. Look at the metal connector end of your flash drive:  If the connector is rectangular and has a piece of plastic taking up part of the connector, you have a USB 3.0 flash drive. If the connector is oval and has no piece of plastic inside of it, you have a USB-C flash drive. If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"? from the following article ?  Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\". Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, \\"the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best\\"., particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores.On 23 March 1881, Nikolai...

It's a unique episode in which it's the only one in Baywatch history that features my three favorite blonds on the same episode...that being Pamela Anderson,Nicole Eggert and Erika Eleniak. You see,Erika's last show was this one and it happened to be Pamela's first.This is also Nicole's debut episode. So,that's a little Baywatch trivia i guess.

The only sour parts of the show for me was Hobie constantly singing that gold miners song (you wanna strangle him after the 2nd time) and the fact that Erika (Shauni) cut her hair at some point and has it short.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less carbon dioxide is removed happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If less carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs, it may lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, a condition known as hypercapnia. This can cause the blood to become more acidic, which may lead to respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis can impair the ability of hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells responsible for binding to and transporting oxygen, to effectively bind to oxygen. As a result, less oxygen will be transported through the body, possibly leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, confusion, and fatigue. Additionally, the buildup of carbon dioxide can lead to increased respiratory effort as the body tries to remove the excess gas, potentially making it more difficult for the lungs to effectively oxygenate the blood. This could also contribute to reduced oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. In summary, while the perturbation of less carbon dioxide removal does not directly affect the amount of oxygen entering the body, it can indirectly impact the oxygen delivery to the body's tissues by influencing the effectiveness of hemoglobin binding and increasing respiratory effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hunley, out in the Charleston, South Carolina  harbor and it sinks with all hands. As the blockade still needs to be broken, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard has the ship raised and puts George E.

Dixon flashes back to the Battle of Shiloh, where a gold coin given to him by his wife (who was later killed in a steamboat explosion caused by a drifting mine) deflected a bullet and saved his life. They take the ship down and sit on the bottom to see how long they can stay down and almost get stuck. The U.S. Navy is warned about the sub. The crew votes that if after an attack they are stuck on the bottom, they will open the valves, flooding the ship, rather than suffocate. They go out to attack the USS Wabash, but the attack fails. Following the warning the ship has draped metal chain netting over the side. Also the rope which was attached to the torpedo they were to release under the ship gets loose and becomes entangled in the propeller. It has to be cut loose while sailors on the Wabash shoot at the Hunley. Beauregard proposes putting the torpedo at the end of a long spar. The USS Housatonic is ordered to change its position in the harbor and always be ready to steam, meaning it cannot hang metal netting over the side. The Hunley's second in command, Lt.

Write the answer: Marked by a violent fear of watter, what is the common name for the disease hydrophobia?","output":"Hydrophobia, marked by a violent fear of water, is commonly known as rabies. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the central nervous system of mammals, including humans, and is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected animal, usually a wild one. The term \\"hydrophobia\\" originates from one of the most characteristic symptoms of rabies in its advanced stage – the intense fear of water or difficulty in swallowing, which occurs due to the virus affecting the person's throat muscles and causing severe pain upon attempting to swallow. The rabies virus is typically present in the saliva of infected animals and enters the victim's body when bitten or scratched. It can also be transmitted when an infected animal's saliva comes in contact with an open wound or mucous membranes, such as the eyes, mouth, or nose. Once inside the body, the virus travels through peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), where it multiplies and causes inflammation, eventually spreading to other organs, including the salivary glands. The incubation period of rabies can range from a few weeks to several months, during which an individual exhibits no symptoms. However, once symptoms appear, the disease progresses rapidly and is almost always fatal if left untreated. Early symptoms of rabies may include fever, headache, malaise, and a general feeling of discomfort. As the disease progresses, more specific neurological symptoms appear, like agitation, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, muscle weakness, paralysis, and the aforementioned swallowing difficulties and fear of water. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 59,000 people die from rabies each year, with more than 95% of these fatalities occurring in Africa and Asia. Dogs are the primary source of human rabies infection globally, contributing to over 99% of all cases. Prevention of rabies in domestic animals, therefore, is critical in minimizing human infection rates. Vaccinating pets and monitoring contact with wild animals are essential components of rabies prevention, as is seeking immediate medical attention for potential exposure to the virus. Although rabies is almost invariably fatal once symptoms appear, it can be prevented through timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP involves administering a series of rabies vaccines, and in some cases, human rabies immune globulin, to individuals who have been exposed to the virus. The treatment is most effective when given soon after exposure, so seeking medical attention immediately after a potential rabies exposure is crucial. In conclusion, hydrophobia is a common name for rabies, a deadly viral disease characterized by a violent fear of water and difficulty swallowing due to infected throat muscles. Rabies is primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal and affects the victim's central nervous system. It is crucial to vaccinate pets, avoid contact with wild animals, and promptly seek medical attention after potential rabies exposure for effective prevention and treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence (Jesse James).

Summarize this article: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — The U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia is confirming that an American has been killed in a part of the country that has seen months of deadly protests.      The embassy on Wednesday attributed the death to head injuries from a rock thrown by \\"unknown individuals\\" on the outskirts of the capital, Addis Ababa.      An Ethiopian official told The Associated Press that the American was an agricultural expert who had gone to the town of Burayu on Tuesday for field work.      Fikadu Tessema, head of the Oromia region's spokesman's office, says the agricultural team that went to the town \\"didn't ask police protection at the time.\\"      This is the first foreigner killed in the massive anti-government protests that have claimed the lives of hundreds of protesters since November 2015. ||||| An American citizen was killed in Ethiopia on Tuesday after the vehicle she was traveling in was struck by rocks thrown by unknown assailants, the State Department confirmed today.      “On October 4, in the late afternoon, a passenger van was hit by rocks thrown by unknown individuals on the outskirts of the city of Addis Ababa. One of the passengers, a U.S. citizen, was struck by a rock and subsequently died from her injury,” the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia said in a consular message issued to Americans in the region.      State Department spokesman Mark Toner declined to identify the individual due to privacy considerations. “We offer our sincerest condolences to her family and loved ones on their loss,” Toner said, adding that the U.S. is “providing all possible consular assistance.” The State Department has referred all questions about the investigation to local authorities and declined to provide any further information.      Addis Ababa has seen experienced a great deal of political and religious unrest recently. On Sunday, a protest broken up by the police resulted in a stampede that left more than 50 people dead, according to local reports.      Demonstrators and government opposition members have been protesting against the Ethiopian government’s plan to integrate infrastructure development and expand the municipal boundary of the capital, Addis Ababa, into surrounding towns in Oromia. Some feared the urban expansion would cause Oromo farmers to lose their traditional lands.      Largely peaceful protests have been met by federal security forces that have allegedly used excessive and lethal force to quell the demonstrations. More than 400 people are estimated to have been killed, thousands injured and tens of thousands arrested since November 2015, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch based on over 125 interviews with witnesses, victims and government officials. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Oromia region has been hit by waves of protests for almost a year      A US citizen has been killed in Ethiopia amid large anti-government protests.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing, despite the common term \\"Civil War\\" in both. They are about entirely different subjects—one is a historical and political concept, the other is about a popular culture reference, specifically a movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let's break them down in detail: Question 1: \\"What is a civil war?\\" In general terms, a civil war is a violent conflict between opposing groups within the same country or nation. The warring parties are often identified along political, ethnic, religious, or tribal lines, who have differing objectives and aims. The scope of civil wars can vary greatly, from small-scale conflicts involving just a few cities or regions within a country, to large-scale wars that can engulf an entire nation. Civil wars are characterized by heavy casualties, widespread infrastructural damage, and significant economic disruption.  Historically, there have been many significant civil wars, such as the American Civil War, the Spanish Civil War, and the Syrian Civil War, among others. These civil wars have had profound impacts on the respective nations involved, including changes in the nature of governance, shifts in territorial boundaries, or even alterations in a nation's demographic makeup. Question 2: \\"What is your review of Captain America: Civil War (2016 movie)?\\" Captain America: Civil War is a superhero film released in 2016, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is based on the Civil War storyline from the Marvel Comics, which focuses on a schism between the superheroes of the Marvel Universe over legislation to regulate superhuman activities. The movie is well-renowned for its thrilling action sequences, deep emotional resonance, and its successful attempt at juggling a large ensemble cast, consisting of various superheroes like Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Spider-Man and more. It tackles themes of responsibility, accountability, and friendship by presenting complex character dynamics and political dilemmas. The Russo Brothers' masterful direction, the character-driven plot, coupled with engaging performances, especially by Chris Evans (Captain America) and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), have contributed to the film's popularity. Despite the movie title containing the term \\"Civil War,\\" the film is not about a historical or political civil war in the way the term is generally understood. Rather, it dramatizes a personal and ideological conflict between two factions of superheroes within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, hence the title \\"Civil War.\\" So, while both the questions have \\"Civil War\\" in common, they are asking about two different subjects: one is about a category of conflict in political history, and the other is about a specific film in the genre of superhero cinema. They are entirely different in terms of the areas involved, the factors and stakes in play, and the consequences that resulted from those events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFWA (or ) is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers in the United States. It was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. The president of SFWA as of 2015 is Cat Rambo.  - Big science is a term used by scientists and historians of science to describe a series of changes in science which occurred in industrial nations during and after World War II, as scientific progress increasingly came to rely on large-scale projects usually funded by national governments or groups of governments. Individual or small group efforts, or Small Science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the Large Hadron Collider, costing between 5 and 10 billion.  - Hard science fiction is a category of science fiction characterized by an emphasis on scientific accuracy. The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful.  - The Ringworld Throne is a novel by Larry Niven , first published in 1996 . It is the direct sequel to his previous work The Ringworld Engineers ( 1980 ) . He wrote it as a replacement after being unable to finish his contracted novel The Ghost Ships , the sequel to The Integral Trees and The Smoke Ring .  - The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by Larry Niven (first published as a serial in \\"Analog\\" in 1983). Like much of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, \\"The Smoke Ring\\", was published in 1987.  - A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large (1029 solar masses) star. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 km, they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed almost entirely of neutrons, which are subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and with slightly larger mass than protons. They are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle. If the remnant has too great a density, something which occurs in excess of an upper limit of the size of neutron stars at 2-3 solar masses, it will continue collapsing to form a black hole.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the \\"Magic Universe\\" or \\"Warlock\\" series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven's subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for a series of full-length novels, \\"The Burning City\\" (2000) and its sequel, \\"Burning Tower\\" (2005), which were co-written with Jerry Pournelle.  - Laurence van Cott Niven (born April 30, 1938)known as Larry Nivenis an American science fiction writer. His best-known work is \\"Ringworld\\" (1970), which received Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America named him the 2015 recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series \\"The Magic Goes Away\\", rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.  - Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detectiveeither professional or amateurinvestigates a crime, often murder.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards by the science fiction and fantasy magazine \\"Locus\\", a monthly based in Oakland, California, United States. The award winners are selected by poll of magazine readers.  - Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. Niven later added four sequels and four prequels. (The Fleet of Worlds series, co-written with Edward M. Lerner provides the four prequels as well as \\"Fate of Worlds\\", the final sequel.) These books tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. \\"Ringworld\\" won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971.  - The Ringworld Engineers is a 1980 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. It is the first sequel to Niven's award-winning \\"Ringworld\\" and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1981.  - The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America to no more than one living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was inaugurated in 1975 when Robert Heinlein was made the first SFWA Grand Master and it was renamed in 2002 after the Association's founder, Damon Knight, who had died that year.

Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander. Simon Yam, all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To's direction, has possibly never been better in the lead, not least because Tony Leung's much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review indicates a positive outlook on the movie, despite certain criticisms.  Firstly, the reviewer acknowledges that \\"Election\\" feels as though it might have been a longer film initially due to numerous characters and plot strands left unresolved. However, this is partially accepted by noting that some aspects are resolved in the sequel, presenting this issue as a continuity matter rather than an inherent failing of the movie itself.  Secondly, the reviewer praises the film as a \\"dependably enthralling thriller,\\" appreciating that it diverges from the traditional reliance on shootouts and explosions, opting instead for a complex portrayal of shifting alliances. This sophistication is admired as it enriches the storyline and maintains audience engagement. The treatment of character development also receives commendation. The depiction of a ruthless character who isn't always the most threatening one introduces a different dimension to the movie.

A recent video that surfaced online has stirred up quite the debate, as it shows a \\"bear-like\\" creature emerging briefly from a wooded area in the Adygeya Republic, Southwestern Russia. The footage captured by a Russian team has led some to believe that they may have finally captured footage of the elusive Yeti, whereas others remain skeptical and question the video's authenticity. The video, which lasts only a few seconds, displays a figure covered in hair as it emerges from an area of trees. Shortly after its appearance, the creature mysteriously disappears back into the woods. This rare sighting has left the Russian team and others convinced that they have identified the mythical Yeti, the legendary apelike beast purported to inhabit remote regions in the world. However, not everyone is convinced about the legitimacy of the footage. Critics have called attention to the possibility that the video was staged in a bid to boost tourism in the region, pointing out that such stunts are not uncommon to attract curious visitors. Skeptics urge a more cautious approach when examining the video and taking into account alternative explanations to the Yeti claim. While the debate surrounding the video's authenticity persists, the identity of the hairy, \\"bear-like\\" creature remains uncertain. For now, enthusiasts and skeptics alike will continue to analyze the footage and weigh in on the possibility of having captured a genuine sighting of the legendary Yeti, igniting further conversation about the existence of this mysterious creature. In conclusion, the short video featuring a hairy creature in Southwestern Russia has sparked much debate and garnered widespread attention as to whether it is truly footage of the long-rumored Yeti or simply a clever stunt to draw visitors. As discussions and investigations continue, the truth behind this enigmatic video is yet to be determined."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. MailOnline Reporter. A 4.2-magnitude earthquake shook Guthrie, Oklahoma, on Tuesday morning. While no injuries have been reported, two local news anchors got quite the scare on air. KAUT co-hosts Lacey Lett and  Emily Sutton were talking about healthy food options about 7:41am when the studio began to shake. 'Earth quake, we just—wait, it's still going,' Sutton told her viewers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. KAUT co-hosts Lacey Lett (left) and Emily Sutton were live at 7:41am on Tuesday when they began to feel an earthquake striking Guthrie, Oklahoma. Lett and Sutton brace themselves while the KAUT studio continues to shake. Massive studio lights are seen shaking back and forth as the excited anchors make awkward chit-chat. 'I'm the person that gets overly-excited about earthquakes,' Sutton told her viewers. The anchor even launched into a post-earthquake dance. 'I can't even focus because I get way too excited,' Sutton added. 'All right, breathe,' co-anchor Lett told her. Residents. and business owners in Guthrie, about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City,. reported a few broken items but not much in terms of extensive damage, KFOR reported. 'It. was just like a boom, then 7,000 bottles going \\"ch-ch-ch-ch-chhhh,\\"' Mark Uselton, who owns a liquor store, told KFOR. 'My heart just. stopped.' Uselton lost three bottle of tequila to the earthquake—luckily for him, the cheap kind. 'This. was a 4.2, 4.3—if we get anything like a 5.0 just get out a mop and a. rag,' he told KFOR. 'Clean it up and go back to work.' Lett and Sutton have a minor freakout when the tremor continues to shake lights during their Tuesday morning broadcast. Sutton could hardly deal with the excitement of an on-air earthquake, dancing and jumping in the tremor's aftermath. In March, a 4.4-magnitude earthquake rolled through Southern California and also forced news anchors to take cover. 'We're having an earthquake!' exclaimed anchor Chris Schauble as he and co-anchor Megan Henderson dove under their desk. It was over almost as quickly as it had begun. But a quick cut to a KTLA correspondent in the field a few miles away revealed he'd felt it, too.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose father was determined that his sons would not work in the mines?, using the article: Henry Moore was born in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.On his second attempt he was accepted at Castleford Grammar School, which several of his siblings had attended, where his headmaster soon noticed his talent and interest in medieval sculpture. His art teacher broadened his knowledge of art, and with her encouragement, he determined to make art his career; first by sitting for examinations for a scholarship to the local art college.  Moore's earliest recorded carvings – a plaque for the Scott Society at Castleford Secondary School, and a Roll of Honour commemorating the boys who went to fight in the First World War from the school – were executed around this time.Despite his early promise, Moore's parents had been against him training as a sculptor, a vocation they considered manual labour with few career prospects. After a brief introduction as a student teacher, Moore became a teacher at the school he had attended. Upon turning eighteen, Moore volunteered for army service. He was the youngest man in the Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles regiment and was injured in 1917 in a gas attack, on 30 November at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor, only returning to France as the Armistice was signed. He recalled later, \\"for..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The last name of the person whose father was determined that his sons would not work in the mines is Moore.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: You could be dueling beautifully until an arrow hits you in the back. Hypothesis: If you are dueling, you won't be hit by an arrow. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze whether or not the premise entails the hypothesis, let's dissect the premise and hypothesis into their core ideas and determine if a logical connection exists between them based on the rules of classical logic. Premise: You could be dueling beautifully until an arrow hits you in the back. This statement suggests three key ideas:  1. You are engaged in a duel. 2. You display exceptional skill in dueling. 3. At some point, an unexpected event occurs, disrupting the duel, i.e., you are hit by an arrow in the back. Hypothesis: If you are dueling, you won't be hit by an arrow. This statement expresses two core ideas: 1. You are engaged in a duel. 2. As long as you are dueling, you are safe from being hit by an arrow. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis: The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there is a contradiction between the two. According to the premise, it's possible to be engaged in a duel and still be hit by an arrow, while the hypothesis asserts that you cannot be hit by an arrow if you are dueling. In fact, the premise contradicts the hypothesis: the premise describes a situation where a person is dueling and subsequently hit by an arrow in the back. This fact demonstrates that being engaged in a duel does not guarantee safety from arrows, thus disproving the hypothesis. Furthermore, the hypothesis suggests that the act of dueling provides protection against being hit by arrows, while the premise implies that a beautiful duel can be interrupted by an arrow in the back. This disconnect further emphasizes the lack of logical entailment between the two statements. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise illustrates a scenario where one is dueling and gets hit by an arrow, which directly contradicts the hypothesis's assertion that being engaged in a duel prevents one from being hit by an arrow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi? from the following article ?  Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","output":"Xuanzang"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Information:  - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.  - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed.  The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old.  - The 2009 UCI BMX World Championships took place at the Adelaide Showgrounds in Adelaide in Australia and crowned world champions in the cycling discipline of BMX .  - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races.  - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross.  - Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. Persons engaged in cycling are referred to as \\"cyclists\\", \\"bikers\\", or less commonly, as \\"bicyclists\\". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, \\"cycling\\" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).  - A unicycle is a vehicle that touches the ground with only one wheel. The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive. Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, and in festivals and as a hobby. Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle hockey. In recent years unicycles have also been used in activities similar to mountain biking or trials.  - UCI BMX World Championships are the world championships for BMX racing (bicycle motorcross) held under the regulations of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's international governing body.  - The Union Cycliste Internationale, commonly known by the acronym UCI, is the world governing body for sports cycling and oversees international competitive cycling events. The UCI is based in Aigle, Switzerland.  - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.  - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland.    What entity does '2009 uci bmx world championships' has the relation 'sport' with? Answer:","output":"The entity '2009 UCI BMX World Championships' has the relation 'sport' with BMX racing (bicycle motocross).

Please write a short summary for the following article: 1m reward for stolen Andy Warhols Andy Warhol sports paintings that have been stolen. Photograph: HO/Reuters A reward of 1m is being offered this weekend for information leading to the recovery of a unique collection of stolen Andy Warhol portraits. The works of art disappeared earlier this month from the Los Angeles home of Richard Weisman, who commissioned them from the artist in the 1970s. Weisman's 10 original silkscreen prints feature famous sporting figures. The images include portraits of boxer Muhammad Ali, tennis player Chris Evert, golfer Jack Nicklaus, footballer Pelé and disgraced actor and former American football star OJ Simpson. They were produced by Warhol between 1977 and 1979. The pieces were taken from the walls of the house's dining room, along with a Warhol portrait of Weisman. Police said the theft had been discovered by a nanny on 3 September. The Weisman family were not at home when she spotted that the Warhol works had been removed. Several valuable artworks, including other notable prints by Warhol, were left untouched. The house, in an exclusive area of the city on Angelo Drive, was locked at the time of the discovery and there was no sign of forced entry. Mark Sommer, a detective with the LA police department's art theft unit, said it was unclear how the paintings had been removed but that witnesses in the road had noted a maroon van parked in the drive at around the time the theft was noticed. \\"This was a very clean crime,\\" Sommer said. \\"[The home] wasn't ransacked. For some reason they had an interest in this collection.\\" Don Hrycyk, another detective, said that the delay in announcing the theft had allowed police to organise the reward and distribute photographs of the missing artworks. The 10 portraits that make up the collection are each about 40 inches by 40 inches and were featured in a book, Picasso to Pop: The Richard Weisman Collection, that was published by Weisman in 2003. He had tried to sell the collection the previous year for 3m (£1.8m). \\"The theft of Warhol's athlete series represents a profoundly personal loss to me and my family,\\" the collector said in a statement on Friday. Warhol became famous as an artist in the 1960s for his ground-breaking pop art images. The artist's bohemian lifestyle, combined with his avant garde film-making and the parties he held at the New York studio known as The Factory, helped to establish him as an enduring cult figure. Brenda Klippel, director of Martin Lawrence Galleries in Los Angeles, which has a large collection of Warhols, said: \\"Warhol was always a portraitist and fascinated with anyone in the public eye. He wanted all of his imagery to be instantly recognisable. \\"If Weisman was in his circle and had the money, he could commission what he wanted.\\" Summary:","output":"A collection of really special paintings by an artist named Andy Warhol have been stolen, and the person who can help find them will get a reward of 1 million dollars! These paintings belonged to a man named Richard Weisman, and they had pictures of famous sport players like Muhammad Ali, Pelé, and OJ Simpson. The paintings were taken from Richard's house while he and his family were not home, but no one knows exactly how they disappeared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Manufacturing and production: The context reveals that Mike Bossy the Scoring Machine was a prototype pinball machine manufactured by Game Plan, Inc. in 1982. Only one machine was produced, indicating that it was a unique and limited project. However, this information does not suggest whether or not Ed Cebula was interested in designing the machine. 2. Features and theme: The pinball machine featured New York Islanders hockey star Mike Bossy, which could be perceived as a selling point for hockey fans or those interested in limited-edition pinball machines. Still, this fact does not provide any indication as to the designer's intentions or preferences on taking part in the project. 3.

The Famous Flames were an American rhythm and blues vocal group founded in Toccoa, Georgia, in 1953 by Bobby Byrd. James Brown began his career as a member of the Famous Flames, emerging as the lead singer by the time of their first professional recording, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", in 1956. On hit songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", and \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", the Flames' smooth backing harmonies contrasted strikingly with Brown's raw, impassioned delivery, and their synchronized dance steps were a prominent feature of their live shows. Altogether, they performed on 12 songs that reached the Billboard R&B and pop charts, in addition to being featured on numerous albums, including the groundbreaking Live at the Apollo. In 1986, the first committee of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announced that James Brown would be one of the Hall of Fame's first charter members to be inducted. However, Brown's former singing group, the Famous Flames, were not included in this induction. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's criterion states that only artists whose first recording had been out for more than 25 years were eligible for induction. Brown's first solo recording did not meet that criterion. Rock & Roll Hall of Fame president and chief executive officer Terry Stewart contended that Brown was indeed eligible for induction but as a member of The Famous Flames. Concerning the Hall of Fame's failure to induct The Flames with Brown back in 1986, Stewart went on to say: \\"There was no legislative intent why they weren't included; somehow they just got overlooked.\\"  In 2011, a special committee was set up to correct exclusions which might have occurred during the first two years of Rock Hall inductions (1986 and 1987) due to the impact of the bands' lead singers or front men. The Famous Flames (Byrd, Bennett, Terry and Stallworth) were inducted in April 2012 alongside other \\"backing groups\\" such as The Midnighters (Hank Ballard), The Comets (Bill Haley), The Crickets (Buddy Holly), The Blue Caps (Gene Vincent) and The Miracles (Smokey Robinson). Since all these lead singers were actually members of these groups, these were not really \\"backing groups\\" at all. This was highlighted by Smokey Robinson, who did the induction honors for all of the groups, including his own Miracles, who stated, \\"These people do not stand behind you.

Bennett further stated the induction was not only a correction for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame committee's mishap in 1986 but also a reunion: \\"For years, I felt like we were all separated,\\" said Bennett. \\"I feel like we're whole again, I wish we could all be here as one group.

According to the information provided in the paragraph, the film stars five actors – Lindsay Lohan, James Deen, Nolan Funk, Amanda Brooks, and Gus Van Sant. This exceeds the count of three main cast members hinted at in the hypothesis. Hence, the particular hypothesis does not hold true in relation to the given information.    It's worth noting that the number of 'main' cast members in a film can often be subjective and context-dependent, usually referring to those who received top-billing or appear most prominently in the narrative. However, the use of the term 'stars' in the text suggests that these five actors were all considered lead players or 'main cast' for the purposes of this film. In addition to that, it's important to note that these are not the only actors in the film, rather only those who were mentioned in this paragraph. It's very likely that there were other supporting actors and extras as it's typical in the film industry, even despite not being named here. The paragraph also provides information about the film's genre, release, plot location, director, and writer.

Markham takes a somewhat 'unclear' point of view when writting about the French Emperor. At times it seems like he is praising Napoleon for one thing or the other and at other times he is criticizing the ' Corsican Orge'. He laudes Napoleon's form of government as being advanced beyond its years yet he draws on unreliable memoirs which denounced Napoleon with impunity. 'Unreliable' memoirs are those which were written by those, between 1815 and 1830, who wished to regain Bourbon favour and be allowed back into prestigious positions. I feel that Markham doesn't give a very lucid explaination for the intervention in Spain or for that matter in Russia.

Summarize this article: Attendees at last autumn's London Fashion Week didn't have to worry about their snacking needs. Outside the main venue in Brewer Street, Soho, a team of workers from upmarket UK popcorn brand Propercorn were there every day to hand out free packets. In total they gave away some 30,000 samples, in what was the 10th time in a row they have been generous at the biannual event. For Propercorn the giveaway is part of a strategy that also sees it offer free packets at arts events in the UK capital, such as Late at the Tate Britain, when the art museum opens its doors at night and puts on a music concert. It is a deliberate move by the company to target the so-called trendsetters and influencers, in the hope that they will speak positively about the product, giving it a word-of-mouth buzz. A Propercorn spokesman explains: \\"Positioning popcorn outside of traditional snack circles, and looking for inspiration at design, fashion, wellbeing and entrepreneurship events, helps us to remain fresh and part of this exciting cultural dialogue. \\"It's less about immediate increase in sales, and more about getting our product in the hands of people who will excitedly and personally engage in our brand and story.\\" Everyone loves a freebie, but is it really free? Not even remotely, says Jean-Pierre Dube, professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Instead, the cost of giving away free samples comes from a firm's marketing budget, which in turn comes from its overall earnings. Prof Dube says: \\"Giving things away is definitely a form of marketing. \\"[For example], when you buy a ski vacation that comes with 'free lessons', the lessons are of course not free. \\"The price of the package was set with the lessons taken into account.\\" He adds: \\"But what about literally giving things away? There is still no free. \\"This is an investment the firm makes in anticipation of receiving the reward in the future. For example, [US cable TV firm] Comcast gave away free digital video recorders as a promotion a few years ago. This was just an investment in receiving the monthly cash flows from people's service subscriptions.\\" If you want to be handed a freebie on the street, it certainly helps to live in a country's capital or largest city. This is not simply because of the larger population, but because a country's main conurbation is more often the trendsetter for retail purchases. So in the UK new products or new promotional campaigns are invariably launched in London, in the US it is New York, while in France it is Paris, and so on. The hope is that the young and fashionable of the big city will try the item, like it, and then talk positively about it - preferably on social media in this day and age. If all goes to plan this will kick start increased sales across the country as a whole. Consumer goods giant Unilever went for this approach last year when it sought to increase UK sales of its Lipton Ice Tea brand. Lipton's Daybreakers campaign saw it give out free drinks at a number of breakfast events across London that included DJ sets and live music. Venues included Old Street in fashionable east London, and the Sky Garden venue at the top of the 34-floor 20 Fenchurch Street building, otherwise known as the \\"walkie talkie\\". A Lipton spokesman says: \\"In order for people to look at Lipton Ice Tea in a new way, we needed to offer consumers a meaningful and relevant reason to try it. \\"We therefore went down an early morning experimental road to cut through and create a clearly different brand experience.\\" UK drinks firm Innocent is also in the habit of first giving out free samples in London, such as when it launched its coconut water product in 2015. This saw it hand out free samples at a pop-up bar in the trendy Shoreditch area. Innocent, which is majority owned by US giant Coca-Cola, has since gone on to offer free samples at UK music festivals Latitude and Wilderness, and at sporting events such as the Richmond marathon, in south west London. Last year it gave away more than 500,000 cartons. James Peach, Innocent's coconut water brand manager, says: \\"For [free] sampling to be effective it's important to be targeting the right type of consumer at the moment they would most likely want to use the product, so they get the most out of the experience, and understand the product's benefits. \\"Generally people drink coconut water to naturally re-hydrate or rejuvenate themselves after exercise or after excess [if they are hungover]. So we simply try to target those occasions as much as we can, to be there when people need it most.\\" While most consumers don't give freebies much thought, behavioural economist Enrico Trevisan says that from the perspective of the business there are three main types; \\"future selling\\", \\"cross selling\\" and \\"up-selling\\". \\"In the future selling approach, firms give away a product for free, assuming that clients will like it and want to buy more in the future,\\" he says. \\"With cross-selling, the company tries to gain new clients through an entrance product, with the intention of selling them additional products during their life cycle.\\" Mr Trevisan, who works for marketing consultancy Simon-Kucher & Partners, says that an example of cross-selling is banks giving current accounts away for free in order to later sell the client loans, mortgages and overdrafts. Finally, he says that up-selling is when a firm gives away a basic version of the product, but then charges the client for more advanced and complete versions. He cites the examples of online news websites that only offer a limited number of free articles. However, Mr Trevisan cautions that while \\"giving something for free to potential users is not necessarily complicated, to convert them into paying customers is a very different story\\". Follow Business Brain series editor Will Smale on Twitter @WillSmale1 Summary:","output":"During special events like London Fashion Week, many companies give away free samples of their products to people who attend. These companies want to give samples to people who follow the latest styles and trends, because they hope these people will tell others about the product. This helps spread the word about the product and might make more people want to buy it. Companies spend money from their marketing budget to provide these free samples; the goal is to make customers interested in buying more in the future. Sometimes these tactics work, but sometimes it's difficult to turn people who get free samples into customers who actually buy the products."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Dion Francis DiMucci (born July 18, 1939), better known mononymously as Dion, is an American singer, songwriter whose work has incorporated elements of doo-wop, rock and R&B styles--and, most recently, straight blues. He was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, with the Belmonts or with the Del Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \\"Runaround Sue\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\", among his other hits. Context: By the end of 1960, Dion had released his first solo album on Laurie, Alone with Dion, and the single \\"Lonely Teenager,\\" which rose to No. 12 in the US charts. The name on his solo releases was simply \\"Dion.\\" Follow-ups \\"Havin' Fun\\" and \\"Kissin' Game\\" had less success, and the signs were that Dion would drift onto the cabaret circuit. However, he then recorded, with a new vocal group, the Del-Satins, an up-tempo number co-written with Ernie Maresca. The record, \\"Runaround Sue,\\" stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching No. 1 in October 1961, and No. 11 in the UK, where he also toured. \\"Runaround Sue\\" sold over a million copies, achieving gold disc status.  For the next single, Laurie promoted the A-side, \\"The Majestic,\\" but it was the B-side, Maresca's \\"The Wanderer,\\" which received more radio play and climbed swiftly up the charts to reach No. 2 in the U.S. in February 1962 and No. 10 in the UK (the 1976 re-release made the UK Top 20). \\"The Wanderer\\" has been used in the post-apocalyptic role-playing game Fallout 4, both in-game and in a trailer of the same name released in 2015.  By the end of 1961, Dion had become a major star, touring worldwide and making an appearance in the Columbia Pictures musical film Twist Around the Clock. He followed with a string of singles - \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" (No. 3), \\"Little Diane\\" (No. 8), \\"Love Came to Me\\" (No. 10) - in 1962, several of which he wrote or co-wrote. He also had successful albums with Runaround Sue and Lovers Who Wander.  At the end of 1962, Dion moved from Laurie to Columbia Records; he was the first rock and roll artist signed to the label, which was an anomaly considering that its then-A&R director, Mitch Miller, passionately loathed that particular genre of music. The first Columbia single, Leiber and Stoller's \\"Ruby Baby\\" (originally a hit for the Drifters) reached No. 2, while \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" (another remake of a Drifters hit) both reached No. 6 in late 1963. (Dion also recorded an Italian version of \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" using the identical backup vocals.) His other Columbia releases were less successful, and problems with his addiction and changing public tastes, especially The British Invasion, saw a period of commercial decline. Question: Did he perform well for Columbia Records?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Dion performed well for Columbia Records at first. When he moved to Columbia Records, some of his songs like \\"Ruby Baby\\" reached No. 2, and both \\"Donna the Prima Donna\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\" reached No. 6 in late 1963.

It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - Edwin Thanhouser (11 November 1865  21 March 1956) was an actor, businessman, and film producer, most notable as a founder of the Thanhouser Company, which was one of the first motion picture studios, along with his wife Gertrude Thanhouser and brother-in-law Lloyd Lonergan.  - Gertrude Homan Thanhouser (April 23, 1882  May 29, 1951), wife of co-founder Edwin Thanhouser, worked at the Thanhouser Company film studio as actress, scenario writer, film editor, and studio executive. Her efforts made the studio one of the key independent US film studios in the nickelodeon and transitional era, praised for its erudite adaptations of Shakespeare and other \\"classical\\" stage dramas to the screen.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America.

Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment.  Which city caused less acid rain? Answer:","output":"Leaf City caused less acid rain than Tree City.  Acid rain is a result of air pollution caused by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These chemicals usually come from the burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gas in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes. When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combine with moisture in the atmosphere, they create sulfuric and nitric acids, which eventually fall back to the ground as acid rain. Since Tree City burned larger amounts of gas and other fossil fuels, it contributed more to the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. In contrast, Leaf City was more environmentally-conscious and protective of its surroundings, which suggests that it relied more on clean energy sources and took measures to limit its use of fossil fuels. As a result, it released fewer pollutants, leading to less acid rain in and around the city. Overall, Leaf City was more environmentally responsible and experienced a lower impact of acid rain compared to Tree City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here's how we can do that step by step: 1. First, we'll start with the given equation: -85 = 3*r - 94 2. Next, we need to get rid of the constant term \\"-94\\" to isolate the term with the variable \\"r\\". To do this, we'll add 94 to both sides of the equation:        -85 + 94 = 3*r - 94 + 94        Simplify:        9 = 3*r 3. Now, we have the equation in the form 9 = 3*r.

In order to isolate r, we need to get rid of the coefficient \\"3\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:    (9 = 3*r) / 3        Simplify:        3 = r So, the solution to the equation -85 = 3*r - 94 is r = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment ( + negative; + positive;).","output":"Title: Disaster at Sunshine High Disaster at Sunshine High is a movie that evidently had potential, but unfortunately fell significantly short of the mark, leaving audiences dissatisfied and disappointed. While the premise initially seemed unique, the plot was haphazard and failed to live up to expectations. The movie aimed to blend dark humor with teen drama, centering on group of misfit students attempting to navigate the treacherous high school social landscape. However, the film struggled in finding the proper balance between comedy and impactful storytelling. The poorly constructed jokes and forced humor left the audience cringing more often than laughing, detracting from the narrative's overarching themes. Moreover, the character development in Disaster at Sunshine High was completely superficial and one-dimensional. The viewer is given little opportunity to empathize with or understand the motives of each character, as they are reduced to mere caricatures of high school stereotypes. This lack of depth prevented the audience from forming any emotional connection to the characters, leading to a dire lack of engagement. On a positive note, the movie's cinematography was quite impressive. The film utilized a visually striking color palette, which contrasted well with the dark undertones of the story. Additionally, the captivating use of background scores managed to temporarily break through the painful mediocrity of the other elements, providing an engaging relief to the largely flawed overall experience. In conclusion, Disaster at Sunshine High is a movie that should have been a powerful exploration of teen angst and identity struggles, but instead the heavy reliance on flat humor, lack of character depth, and weak plotlines resulted in a disappointing viewing experience. While the movie boasted commendable visuals, it's just not enough to save it from its numerous shortcomings. One can only hope that the creative minds involved will learn from this misstep and create more engaging and fleshed-out stories in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb .

The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with well done co-starring turns by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film, down to clothing, was closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover didn't have something to be proud of. His management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world. But by 1959 Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom. And he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau.

Sentence 1: at six o'clock yeah yeah i know Sentence 2: It is at noon. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In order to determine entailment, it is essential to understand the meaning of the two sentences and the relationship between them. Entailment is a semantic relation in which the truth of one sentence necessarily implies the truth of the other. In other words, if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must also be true for entailment to exist. Sentence 1: \\"At six o'clock yeah yeah I know\\" This sentence implies that the speaker acknowledges something happening or being discussed at six o'clock. The repetition of \\"yeah\\" might suggest the speaker's enthusiasm or impatience. However, without any additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact situation occurring at six o'clock. Sentence 2: \\"It is at noon\\" This sentence states that another event or occurrence is scheduled or expected to happen at noon. Here, the time mentioned is explicitly different from the time mentioned in Sentence 1 – noon as opposed to six o'clock. Because the two sentences mention different times (six o'clock and noon) and do not provide any explicit connection between the events or situations they refer to, there is no entailment between Sentence 1 and Sentence 2. They describe separate occurrences or situations without any direct implication of the truth of the other. The truth of Sentence 1 does not necessarily imply the truth of Sentence 2, and vice versa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\"  Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given...

Being a party planner suited Benjamin but not Dennis because  Choose from: a. Benjamin paid attention to details.; b. Dennis paid attention to details.;","output":"Being a party planner suited Benjamin but not Dennis because Benjamin paid attention to details. While both Benjamin and Dennis had a love for organizing events and creating memorable experiences, their approach to party planning was significantly different. Benjamin, as a detail-oriented party planner, thrived in the intricate and meticulous nature of the profession. He knew that when it came to planning an event, every little detail mattered – from the choice of venue and decorations, down to the color of the napkins and the arrangement of the food on the buffet table. Benjamin's keen eye for detail, combined with his skills in time management and organization, made him an exceptional party planner. He would spend hours researching and sourcing the perfect elements to meet his clients' expectations and ensure their parties were flawless and unforgettable. Benjamin understood that the success of each event relied heavily on his ability to juggle and manage multiple tasks at once, while also maintaining a laser-sharp focus on the finer points of the event planning process. On the other hand, Dennis struggled with focusing on details. He was more of a big-picture thinker, which caused him to overlook crucial aspects of party planning. Although his vision for the theme and vibe of the event might be spot-on, Dennis’s lack of attention to detail had the potential to result in underwhelming execution. For instance, Dennis might plan an incredible outdoor garden party with beautiful floral arrangements throughout the space, but fail to consider contingencies for poor weather, leaving the event ruined by an unexpected downpour. Additionally, Dennis's tendency to gloss over smaller aspects could lead to things like mismatched dinnerware or a lack of dietary options for guests with allergies, diminishing the overall event experience for attendees. It was evident that party planning was a particular niche that demanded a great deal of focus on details. Benjamin's natural affinity for the finer aspects of event planning not only made him a sought-after professional in the industry, but it also ensured that his clients were consistently satisfied with the results. Unfortunately, Dennis's inability to attend to details meant that he would be better suited to pursue a career that allowed him to focus on broader concepts and visions, rather than the intricacies inherent within the field of party planning."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

First, simplify the right hand side of the equation. -19u - 2u can be simplified to -21u. So, the equation then is -42u = -21u - 147. Next, we'll try to isolate the variable 'u'. We can do this by adding '21u' to both sides of the equation to balance it. -42u + 21u = -21u - 147 + 21u This simplifies to: -21u = -147. To completely isolate 'u', divide the equation by '-21'.

I couldn't put off sorting through it any longer. I checked the envelopes, putting aside the ones addressed to my husband. It had been over three years since Bob had died. To friends and family it looked like I had moved past the worst of my sorrow. I took care of my house, socialized and kept up with community. On the outside everything appeared to be normal. But inside I was anything but I worried I would never get better, never be myself again. They say sorrow has no set time limit, but I was so tired of feeling empty and hopeless. My sorrow was sharp and fresh as ever. It was like a wall of pressure in my chest, pressing my heart. I picked up a piece of Bob's mail and held it out to tear in half, but stopped myself from cutting up the envelope. The letter was from an organization that funded a Haitian orphanage called _ . Its founder, Carol Hawthorne, had given a presentation at our church. Bob and I had donated, and Bob ended up on the mailing list to receive the newsletter   with updates on the children. I hadn't read one since Bob died. But just three months before, in January 2012, the country had been hit by a terrible earthquake. In my depressed state, it hadn't even occurred to me to wonder whether the orphanage had survived. I opened the newsletter and was surprised to find out that My Father's House was still standing. Of course now it was more crowded than ever. At the bottom of the page was an announcement about an upcoming trip to visit the orphanage in person. \\"I should go.\\" The thought wouldn't leave me. I contacted Carol Hawthorne.\\"What would I do if I go?\\" I asked.\\"Build houses?\\" \\"The Haitian people there are eager to work and they know what they're doing,\\" said Carol. \\"What they need are raw materials, and we provide them. We also visit with the children. We go to clinics and schools, pass out supplies. You'll be very busy, I promise!\\" I reserved a seat but didn't mention it to any of my friends.

If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right.

Given the below context:  Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun.

Alaska is the largest and most sparsely populated U.S. state, situated in the northwest part of the North American continent. It has a total land area of 663,267 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers) and a populace of approximately 731,545 as of 2019.  Alaska's border with Canada stretches for approximately 1,538 miles (2,475 kilometers), sharing its boundaries with British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. The border to the east extends from the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean and traverses southward along the rugged terrains of mountain ranges, rivers, and dense forests until reaching the Dixon Entrance, a narrow body of water that separates Alaska and British Columbia.  This extensive border is a result of historical events and various geopolitical negotiations, including the boundary treaty between the Russian Empire and the British Empire in 1825, and the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The latter saw the United States acquiring Alaska from the Russian Empire for a sum of 7.2 million. The border's length facilitates various forms of interactions between the United States and Canada, including trade, tourism, and diplomatic ties. However, it also poses challenges for cross-border security and environmental preservation efforts, particularly given the expansive and often-remote nature of the Alaskan wilderness.

Officials working to free 33 trapped miners in northern Chile denied Thursday they are under political orders to rescue the men ahead of President Sebastian Pinera's planned mid-month trip to Europe. \\"No decision about any part of the rescue operation has been linked to any political decision. The miners' health and technical decisions come first,\\" Interior Minister official Cristian Barra said in a news conference at the San Jose gold and copper mine. \\"The president's agenda is not connected to the timeline for rescue. There are no guarantees this will be before October 17,\\" he added. Pinera said earlier this week he believed the 33 miners would be rescued before October 15. He is due to depart on a government visit to Europe on October 17, government officials said. In his last visit to the mine on September 19, Pinera pledged to return the day the miners were extracted and personally hug each one. Mines Minister Laurence Golborne said over the weekend that his best estimate was that the miners would be extracted in the second half of October. Political opponents and even some relatives of the trapped miners have speculated in recent weeks that Pinera was trying to score political points from the miners' rescue. National opinion polls show his popularity has risen thanks to his handling of the accident. Prior to the disaster his administration had been under political fire for the slow pace of government reconstruction after the February earthquake and tsunami along Chile's south and central coast, and for his handling of a hunger strike by members of the Mapuche indigenous group of southern Chile, who are fighting for independence. Against the backdrop of political questioning, technical problems plagued the drilling effort at the San Jose mine. The Strata 950 drill, dubbed Plan A, had reached 587 meters by 8 a.m. Tuesday. The men are nearly 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground, but could be rescued from different levels. Andre Sougarret, mines manager for state-run copper company Codelco and on-site rescue coordinator, said that operation was stopped Tuesday while the drill head was changed. It was not expected to resume until late Wednesday. It is currently making its first pass down with a 12.5-inch diameter hole to the roof of the 50-square-meter (500-square-foot) refuge at Level 100 (100 meters above sea level). It would have to make a second pass to widen that shaft to 28 inches. The Schramm T-130 drill, so-called Plan B, was at 466 meters as of 8 a.m. Tuesday and is aiming for the roof of the mine workshop on Level 135 (135 meters above sea level). It had completed just two meters in the previous 24 hours. Sougarret said the drill hammer had been swapped out but hit fresh problems after running into rock that was tougher than expected. He said the drill diameter would be reduced from 28 inches to 26 inches until the hammer had cleared the hard rock but added that the slightly smaller diameter would not cause problems for the rescue. The Rig 421 oil drill, so-called Plan C, is currently at 265 meters and en route to the roof of the tunnel at Level 150 (150 meters above sea level). It is currently drilling a 17.5-inch diameter hole -- smaller than the 28 inches required to rescue the miners -- in an effort to realign after veering off course over the weekend. Mine engineer Renee Aguilar, another of the rescue coordinators, said the first 10 members of a 16-strong extraction team arrived at the San Jose mine Tuesday. The group consisted of Codelco rescue experts. Two other rescue experts from the northern Atacama region, along with three Navy and one police paramedic, were due to arrive at the mine later Tuesday. Once the rescue shaft has been completed and the extraction begins, four members of the 16-person team will be chosen to descend into the mine to carry out final medical checks on the 33 miners. They will then enclose the miners, one-by-one, in a 21.5-inch diameter rescue cage that has been dubbed the \\"Phoenix capsule.\\" Rescuers on the surface will winch them up. Jean Romagnoli, sports medic and personal trainer working to get the miners in shape for their rescue, said the Phoenix capsule would be hoisted to the surface at a speed of about 60 kilometers per hour and would exert about 2 Gs of pressure on the miners. He said small bio-metric monitors, mounted on chest belts, had been sent down to the miners to help keep track of their physical condition. He said the miners are working out for at least one hour a day to ensure they keep their weight down and can fit into the rescue capsule. The U.S.-made monitors, known as Zephyr BioHarnesses, will record the miners' vital signs, pulse, heart rhythm and breathing.

In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

The energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (those staged performances, usually musical, that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days) must deal with crooked competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the FOOTLIGHT PARADE. While closely resembling other Warner's musical spectaculars, notably the GOLDDIGGER films, this movie had a special attraction none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. He is a wonder, loose-jointed and lithe, as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie. Cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go, powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm. The rest of the cast gives their best, as well. Joan Blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed, big-hearted blonde secretary, infatuated with Cagney (major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number?). Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler once again play lovers onstage & off; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; Powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead. Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law, both scheming to cheat Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee's wealthy wife, a woman devoted to her handsome protégés. Frank McHugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger. Mavens will spot little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin & maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. Finally, there's Busby Berkeley, choreographer nonpareil. His terpsichorean confections, sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's, were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that Depression audiences wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were meant, as part of the plot, to be stage productions. But no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera. Berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either a story (often rather bizarre) told with song & dance; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers, eye candy, featuring plentiful chorus girls, overhead camerawork & a romantic tune.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The massive amounts of chalk in the Cretaceous period were caused by mid-ocean ridge activity, which circulated seawater through the enlarged ridges, enriching the oceans in calcium. This increased the saturation of calcium in the oceans as well as its bioavailability for calcareous nanoplankton, leading to widespread carbonate and chalk deposits during this period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The director of the acclaimed films 'Twelve Angry Men,' 'Serpico,' and 'Network,' who passed away in 2011, was Sidney Lumet. Born on June 25, 1924, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lumet grew up in a family deeply rooted in the performing arts, as his father Baruch Lumet was an actor in the Yiddish Art Theatre and his mother Eugenia Wermus Lumet was a dancer. Sidney Lumet began his career in the entertainment industry as a stage actor, transitioning to directing in the early 1950s. He initially directed several TV shows before making his feature film debut with the groundbreaking 1957 drama 'Twelve Angry Men.' The movie, which starred Henry Fonda and focused on jury deliberations in a murder trial, was critically acclaimed and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Director. Continuing his illustrious career, Lumet directed 'Serpico' in 1973, a crime drama starring Al Pacino as Frank Serpico, a real-life NYPD officer who blew the whistle on rampant corruption within the police department. The film was a commercial and critical success, garnering Oscar nominations and solidifying Lumet's reputation as a master of gritty, realistic dramas. In 1976, Lumet directed 'Network,' a satirical film centered around a fictional television network, Union Broadcasting System (UBS), and its struggle for ratings. The film, written by Paddy Chayefsky, starred Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, William Holden, and Robert Duvall. 'Network' was a monumental hit, receiving ten Academy Award nominations and winning four, including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Original Screenplay. Throughout his career, Sidney Lumet directed over 50 films that spanned various genres and styles, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Some other renowned films in his repertoire include 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975), 'Murder on the Orient Express' (1974), 'The Verdict' (1982), and 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' (2007). On April 9, 2011, Sidney Lumet passed away at the age of 86 in his Manhattan home due to complications related to lymphoma. His contributions to the film industry have been widely recognized, earning numerous accolades and praise for his penchant for tackling challenging social issues, creating complex characters, and cultivating incredible performances from his actors."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available options: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","output":"C). no. The reason for this answer is as follows: In the first sentence, the speaker is expressing an opinion that a \\"steady diet of violence\\" may be a cause of an issue instead of explicitly stating it as a fact. The use of language in this sentence, such as \\"I think\\" and \\"may,\\" demonstrates the uncertainty and the tentative nature of the statement. This suggests that the speaker believes violence might be a contributing factor in a particular situation, but there could be other underlying causes as well. In contrast, the second sentence asserts that the issue is not caused by \\"all of the violence they see.\\" This statement implies that violence has a minimal or no impact on the situation, differing from the perspective expressed in the first sentence. Given that the first sentence presents an opinion suggesting violence may indeed be a contributing factor, and the second sentence contradicts this by stating that it is not caused by all of the violence seen, the two sentences cannot both be true simultaneously. Thus, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true, making the correct answer \\"C). no.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!

Possible answers:  * Tami wished Gina would shut up, but she just kept talking.;  * They just walked comfortably in silence for a while.;","output":"It is more likely that the next event in the story would be that they just walked comfortably in silence for a while. After having a conversation for five minutes, Gina and Tami found themselves out of things to discuss, and there is no indication in the given story that there is any tension or animosity between the two friends. In the first option, Tami wishing Gina would shut up assumes a negative intent that has not been hinted at in the story so far. If Gina is unable to come up with more topics for conversation and they have run out of things to talk about, it would be reasonable for them to simply enjoy each other's company without the need for constant conversation. Walking comfortably in silence showcases the strength of their friendship, as they can appreciate each other's presence without the need for constant engagement. This is a common characteristic of strong and long-lasting friendships, where people can be at ease in each other's company without the pressure of always needing to chat. It also allows Gina and Tami the opportunity to gather their thoughts or take a break from talking and simply enjoy the surroundings of the playground. As they continued their walk, it's possible that they might come across something that reignites their conversation. Perhaps they would see a group of children playing and recall their own childhood memories or spot an interesting structure at the playground that prompts them to discuss their likes and dislikes. In any case, the silence between them wouldn't necessarily last forever; it would simply serve as a natural and comfortable break in their conversation.

Additionally, I ensured that the translation includes proper Bulgarian grammar, such as subject-verb agreement, word order, and other grammatical structures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Why do Recruiters not seem to know the difference between a Black Box QA Engineer and a QA White Box Engineer? \\"Aviation Accidents and Incidents: Why is a black box (flight data recorder) called a 'black' box?\\" Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"No, those questions are not the same. They talk about different things. Let me explain: 1. The first question is about jobs: Black Box QA Engineer and White Box QA Engineer. Black Box QA Engineer checks if software works well without knowing how it was made. It's like watching a magic trick and saying if it's good, without knowing how it's done. White Box QA Engineer checks how software is made by looking at the code and finding any wrong parts. It's like checking the recipe of a cake to see if it's made correctly. Recruiters might get confused because both jobs are about making sure software works well, but they do it in different ways. 2. The second question is about airplanes and the black box, which is called a flight data recorder. The black box is an important part in airplanes. It records what the airplane is doing, like how fast it is flying, where it is going, and what the pilots are saying. If an airplane has an accident, the black box helps people understand what happened. The name \\"black box\\" is a bit confusing because it's usually orange or red, not black. So, the first question is about jobs related to software testing, and the second question is about a part in airplanes that helps understand accidents. They are different questions about different things."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\".  - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Frankenstein's monster, sometimes known as Frankenstein, is a fictional character whose fictional creator was Victor Frankenstein. The monster first appeared, without any name, in Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus\\". Shelley's title thus compares Victor Frankenstein to the mythological character Prometheus who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. Although nameless in Shelley's novel, the creature took on the name \\"Frankenstein\\" in later years.   - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.  - Count Dracula is the title character and main antagonist of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. He is also depicted in the novel to be the origin of werewolf legends. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad III the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula. Other character aspects have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works. The character has subsequently appeared frequently in popular culture, from films to animated media to breakfast cereals.  - Sagas are stories mostly about ancient Nordic and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, the battles that took place during the voyages, about migration to Iceland and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - A werewolf (from , \\"man\\"), man-wolf, or lycanthrope (\\"lykánthropos\\": , \\"lykos\\", \\"wolf\\", and , \\"anthrpos\\", \\"human\\") is a mythological or folkloric human with the ability to shapeshift into a wolf or a therianthropic hybrid wolf-like creature, either purposely or after being placed under a curse or affliction (e.g. via a bite or scratch from another werewolf). Early sources for belief in lycanthropy are Petronius (2766) and Gervase of Tilbury (11501228).  - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural. Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for the larger fears of a society.  - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\")   - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - Werewolf fiction denotes the portrayal of werewolves and other shapeshifting man/woman-beasts, in the media of literature, drama, film, games, and music. Werewolf literature includes folklore, legend, saga, fairy tales, Gothic and Horror fiction, fantasy fiction and poetry. Such stories may be supernatural, symbolic or allegorical. A classic American cinematic example of the theme is \\"The Wolf Man\\" (1941) and in later films joins with Frankenstein's monster and Count Dracula, as one of the three famous icons of the modern day horror. However, werewolf fiction is an exceptionally diverse genre with ancient folkloric roots and manifold modern re-interpretations.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature.  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - This is a list of wolves in fiction , including normal wolves and anthropomorphic wolf characters . For werewolf characters see werewolf fiction .  - Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, famous for introducing the character of the vampire Count Dracula.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.

Remarkably, he could read, yet, in spite of his reading skills, Steve was failing. He had been failing since first grade, as he was passed on from grade to grade.

For the first time in his young life, he couldn't take his eyes off his teacher; yet, still he failed. He never did his homework, and he was always in trouble with Miss White. His heart would break under her sharp words, and when he was punished for failing to turn in his homework, he felt just miserable! Still, he did not study. In the middle of the first semester of school, the entire seventh grade was tested for basic skills. Steve hurried through his tests, and continued to dream of other things, as the day wore on. His heart was not in school, but in the woods, where he often escaped alone, trying to shut out the sights, sounds and smells of his alcoholic home. No one checked on him to see if he was safe. No one knew he was gone, because no one was sober  enough to care. Oddly, Steve never missed a day of school.

Especially in the winter, a colorful scarf can provide a cute and colorful addition to your uniform or dress code. Wear cute cardigans, or other cold weather clothing items, with some detailing that attracts attention. You can also sport unique jackets that express your sense of style in the colder months. Dress code or no dress code, you can use accessories to express your individuality and style. Often belts have to be leather and the buckle size is restricted, but there may not be color guidelines or belt buckle type guidelines. Get bright colors or patterns that attract attention. Did your mom already buy you a drab brown belt? Glue glitter on the buckle or otherwise embellish it. If you can't add anything or don't want to, you can just use a black belt with a vintage buckle. If there aren't any jewelry restrictions in the dress code, you can wear bracelets, necklaces, earrings, or rings that stand out and make you feel special. Adding funky and bold jewelry will make you stand out without pushing the clothing guidelines. Then you can look really original.  This is a great way to add a flare of individualism to a dress code without too much pushback from the administration. For guys, try wearing a cool chunky watch or a fun necklace. You might also consider adding interesting buttons or pins to your jackets or backpacks. A great way to spice up your personal style is by wearing glasses that help you express your individual personality. Consider getting colorful frames, big boxy frames, uniquely shaped frames, or even frames with a pattern on them.

În ultimii ani, organizațiile europene s-au confruntat cu numeroase provocări, de la creșterea populismului și a mișcărilor anti-UE, până la criza migranților și problemele economice. Pentru a face față acestor probleme într-un mod eficient și durabil, este esențial ca instituțiile europene să acționeze astfel încât să poată satisface nevoile cetățenilor și să poată face față provocărilor actuale și viitoare. Pentru a aborda problema în mod serios, instituțiile europene ar putea lua în considerare următoarele măsuri: 1. Consolidați cooperarea și coordonarea între statele membre: Acest lucru ar implica o colaborare și comunicare mai strânsă între țările membre ale UE pentru a stabili obiective comune și strategii eficiente în diverse domenii precum politica externă, defense, economie și protecția mediului. 2. Consolidarea democrației și a transparenței în cadrul UE: Acesta este un element cheie pentru a câștiga încrederea cetățenilor și a combate efectele populismului și euroscepticismului. Instituțiile europene ar trebui să lucreze la promovarea valorilor democratice, a statului de drept și a drepturilor fundamentale, garantând în același timp transparența și răspunderea lor. 3. Investiți în dezvoltarea economică și socială a Europei: Aceasta include investiții în educație, cercetare și infrastructură, creând locuri de muncă și stimulând creșterea economică. De asemenea, este important să își dubleze eforturile pentru a combate sărăcia și inegalitatea, promovând în același timp solidaritatea între statele membre și regiuni. 4. Abordați schimbările climatice și protejați mediul: Instituțiile europene ar trebui să continue să-și intensifice eforturile pentru a combate schimbările climatice și a promova dezvoltarea durabilă, prin reducerea emisiilor de gaze cu efect de seră, promovarea energiilor regenerabile și protejarea biodiversității. 5. Elaborarea unei politici de migrație echilibrate și durabile: Acest aspect implică gestionarea corectă și eficientă a fluxurilor de migrație, precum și integrarea armonioasă a migranților și refugiaților în societățile europene. De asemenea, este crucială abordarea cauzelor fundamentale ale migrației și a cooperării cu țările de origine și de tranzit.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? of a first-rate cast","output":"The phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" is generally considered positive. In order to provide a detailed and extended explanation, let's break down the phrase and analyze each component. 1. \\"First-rate\\": The term \\"first-rate\\" is an adjective, which means it is a word used to describe a noun. In this context, \\"first-rate\\" is being used to describe the quality or competence of the cast. The word \\"first-rate\\" itself denotes top or superior quality, indicating that the cast being referred to is among the best or is highly talented. Using such a term to describe a cast indicates that they possess exceptional skills and abilities in their craft. 2. \\"Cast\\": The \\"cast\\" refers to a group of actors or performers who come together to put on a theatrical, film, or television production. A cast is an essential part of any production as it often consists of an ensemble of talented individuals with diverse skills and background, who work collectively to bring characters and stories to life. With these two components combined, the phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" suggests that the referred cast comprises highly skilled and accomplished actors or performers. By extension, this implies that their acting abilities, chemistry, and combined effort make the overall production or show stand out and excel. Such a cast would garner admiration from both critics and audiences and appear in high-quality, well-received projects. In conclusion, the phrase \\"of a first-rate cast\\" is considered a positive description, as it speaks to the exceptional level of talent, competence, and skill possessed by the actors or performers that form the cast in question.

At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics  , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s.

Even many adults who do not fit the clinic definition of obesity are still overweight,and a large percentage are looking for the best ways to lose weight. Reducing pounds largely comes down to the two-sided factors of diet and exercise.Not carrying out the first one enough,and not getting enough of the second one,ends up giving the individual a recipe for being overweight.

He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach.

Question: This article: Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not \\"breed\\" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in Ptolemaic Egypt and in manumission inscriptions at Delphi. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term.

Gauguin was foremost a painter; he came to ceramics around 1886, when he was taught by the French sculptor and ceramist Ernest Chaplet. They had been introduced by Félix Bracquemond who, inspired by the new French art pottery, was experimenting with the form. During that winter of 1886–87, Gauguin visited Chaplet's workshop at Vaugirard, where they collaborated on stoneware pots with applied figures or ornamental fragments and multiple handles. Gauguin first visited Tahiti in 1891 and, attracted by the beauty of Tahitian women, undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived. He completed Oviri in the winter of 1894, during his return from Tahiti, and submitted it to the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts 1895 salon opening in April the following year. There are two versions of what ensued: Charles Morice claimed in 1920 that Gauguin was \\"literally expelled\\" from the exhibition; in 1937 Ambroise Vollard wrote that the piece was admitted only when Chaplet threatened to withdraw his own works in protest. According to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin was keen to increase his public exposure and availed of this opportunity by writing an outraged letter to Le Soir, bemoaning the state of modern ceramics.At the outset of 1897, Vollard addressed a letter to Gauguin about the possibility of casting his sculptures in bronze. Gauguin's response centred on Oviri: I believe that my large statue in ceramic, the Tueuse (\\"The Murderess\\"), is an exceptional piece such as no ceramist has made until now and that, in addition, it would look very well cast in bronze (without retouching and without patina).

Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of Chinese immigrants. In the Chinese culture, the tighter represents strength and power. In her book, Ms. Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. Chua writes that her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to go on a date, be in a school play, watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A. They had to play piano or violin - and no other musical instruments.     She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B - which she says \\"would never happen\\" - there would be \\"a screaming, hair-tearing explosion.\\" She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly - yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom - until it was. Many people have criticized Amy Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, objected to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Stacy Debroff, who has written four books on parenting, says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life.

Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: \\"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there.

South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun Thursday asked the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) to investigate questions arising about the Foreign Ministry's response to the kidnapping of a South Korean in Iraq who was later killed by Muslim militants, according to Yonhap. Can we draw the following conclusion? They always kill South Korean's that are kidnapped","output":"Based on the information provided about the kidnapping of a South Korean in Iraq who was later killed by Muslim militants, it would be inaccurate to draw a sweeping conclusion that \\"they always kill South Koreans that are kidnapped.\\" This statement is an overgeneralization that does not consider the complexities and nuances of such situations. We must analyze the broader context and assess individual cases independently to form valid conclusions. Firstly, it is essential to understand that the kidnapping and murder of the South Korean in this case took place in a specific context. In this instance, it was during an insurgency in Iraq when different militant groups were carrying out abductions of foreigners to advance their political goals. While this case is tragic and deserves attention, it is not representative of every situation in which a South Korean might be kidnapped. Secondly, the term \\"they\\" in the statement could refer to various groups of people, making the assertion even more flawed. The statement assumes all kidnappings are carried out by a single, homogeneous group of perpetrators who consistently follow the same tactics in dealing with kidnapped individuals, which is clearly not the case. Kidnappers may range from terrorists to criminal gangs or even individuals acting alone, each with their own motives and methods. Moreover, it is important to note that each kidnapping case is unique and can be influenced by an array of factors such as the goals of the kidnappers, the characteristics of the victim, the political climate, and international pressure, among others. The outcomes of kidnappings cannot be generalized in such a simplistic manner, as each situation develops differently. In some instances, kidnapped victims may be released unharmed, while others might be held for ransom or, tragically, be killed. Finally, drawing a conclusion based on one specific incident would not be statistically valid or representative of the entire scope of kidnappings involving South Koreans. Cases of abductions and kidnappings globally vary widely, and it is necessary to examine multiple sources, statistics, and historical trends to identify patterns and make informed conclusions. In conclusion, the statement that \\"they always kill South Koreans that are kidnapped\\" is an overgeneralization that does not consider the numerous factors that affect individual kidnapping cases. A more accurate understanding can only be achieved by examining each situation in its unique context and considering various influencing factors such as the motives of the kidnappers, the political landscape, and the specific circumstances surrounding the abduction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that played drums for Warsaw on their first gig? , can you please find it?   On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

Dretke to the other case that was held in the Supreme Court?\\"  Context: \\"The United States Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Bigby v. Dretke have been clear in their decisions that jury instructions in death penalty cases that do not ask about mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health violate the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights, saying that the jury is to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh mitigating factors.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The general policy that connects Bigby v. Dretke to the other case held in the Supreme Court, Penry v. Lynaugh, is the requirement for jury instructions in death penalty cases to explicitly include consideration for mitigating factors relating to the defendant's mental health. This policy is based on the protection of the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. In both cases, the courts emphasized the importance of providing clear and specific instructions to the jury regarding the consideration of mitigating factors when they are answering unrelated questions. This policy stems from the understanding that jurors need to be well-informed about the defendant's mental health and how that could potentially affect their culpability. Without such instructions, there is a risk of jurors not factoring in these mitigating circumstances, leading to a potentially unjust sentence. The United States Supreme Court in Penry v. Lynaugh (1989) ruled that the imposition of the death penalty on the defendant, who suffered from intellectual disabilities, violated the Eighth Amendment. The Court highlighted the need for the jury to be instructed to consider mitigating factors when answering unrelated questions. The case established the guideline that courts should ensure jury instructions allow for proper consideration of mitigating factors, which could warrant a sentence less severe than the death penalty. Similarly, in Bigby v. Dretke (2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the importance of including mitigating factors regarding the defendant's mental health in jury instructions of death penalty cases. In this case, the Court found that the jury instructions did not adequately address the defendant's mental health as a mitigating factor, and consequently, the court held that the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights were violated. The policy connecting these two cases emphasizes the necessity of specific explanations to jurors about the relevance of mitigating factors and the importance of considering them in the sentencing process. Despite the two cases involving different sets of facts, both courts agreed that jury instructions in death penalty cases must present clear, comprehensive, and explicit information about the defendant's mental health issues and other potential mitigating factors. By doing so, the courts aim to ensure that defendants' Eighth Amendment rights are protected and that jurors are equipped with the necessary guidance to make informed and just decisions in capital cases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it did prevent Prussia from invading parts of Saxony. More significantly, its military performance proved far better than during the War of the Austrian Succession and seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms.

Also, by promising to vote for Joseph II in the Imperial elections, Frederick II accepted the Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire.

The 182-meters (597 feet) bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence... (Associated Press)      KEVADIYA, India (AP) — India's prime minister on Wednesday unveiled a towering bronze statue of Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, a key independence leader and the country's first home minister after British colonialists left in 1947.      At 182 meters (597 feet), it is one of the tallest statues in the world built at a cost of 403 million in Kevadiya, a village in Gujarat state. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Patel hail from Gujarat state.      Modi inaugurated the \\"Statue of Unity\\" on the bank of the Narmada river. He had promised the project despite criticism that India couldn't afford to spend so much money on a statue.      Indian air force planes showered flower petals on the statue.      Patel was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" for integrating various states in the post-independence era as the creation of Pakistan led to a massive bloodshed between Hindus and Muslims moving between the two nations.      On Wednesday, Modi said Patel was a beacon of hope for India in the time of crisis and he will be a source of inspiration for ages to come.      Rashesh Patel, a 42-year-old businessman, said \\"though Patel was from Gujarat state, all Indians were proud of him because of his stature.\\"      Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel were the three key leaders of India's independence struggle, he said.      The monument will have a museum with 40,000 documents, 2,000 photographs and a research center dedicated to Patel's life and work. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The \\"statue of unity\\" has been billed as a tourist attraction.      India has unveiled the world's tallest statue, which cost 29.9bn rupees (£330m; 430m) to build.      The 182m (600ft) high structure in the western state of Gujarat is a bronze-clad tribute to independence leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.      Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the \\"statue of unity\\" would serve as a major tourist attraction.      But locals say this is as a waste of public money and that the funds could have been put to better use.      Mr Modi, who unveiled the statue at a grand inaugural event, said it is \\"a symbol of India's integrity and resolve.\\"      Air Force planes showered flowers on the statue, which was designed by decorated Indian sculptor Ram V Sutar.      According to local reports, thousands of policemen have been deployed across the district, where protests over the effigy have turned violent. Police detained farmers and tribal activists during a protest on Tuesday.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stunning visuals of the world's tallest statue      The statue has become a rallying point for local farmers who are demanding compensation for land that they say has been acquired by the government for various projects, including the construction of the memorial.      The Gujarat government is reported to have paid more than half of the funds for the statue, while the remainder came from the federal government or public donations.      The memorial has been seen as a pet project of Mr Modi, who like Patel, was born in Gujarat. He commissioned the statue when he was the state's chief minister in 2010.      It is nearly twice as tall as New York's Statue of Liberty. And it has surpassed the height of the Spring Temple Buddha in China which, at 128m, was previously the tallest in the world.      But it won't remain the world's tallest statue for long. The government in the western state of Maharashtra is constructing a memorial to the Maratha warrior king Shivaji that is estimated to be 190m tall.      Patel was India's first interior minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as the \\"Iron Man of India\\" after he persuaded feuding states to unite and become part of the Indian state after independence.      While campaigning in 2013 to become prime minister, Mr Modi said, \\"every Indian regrets that Sardar Patel did not become the first prime minister\\".      In recent years, Mr Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has embraced Patel in an attempt to claim his legacy. While Congress party politicians say Patel was a member of their party, the BJP says the freedom fighter's legacy belongs to everybody.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials expect that the 182m tall statue will attract millions of annual visitors      Officials expect that the site, located some 200km (125 miles) from Gujarat's main city, Ahmedabad, will attract about 2.5 million annual visitors and will help boost local economy.      Visitors can go up to the viewing gallery, which is located near the chest of the statue at a height of 153m.      But locals, including farmers, are sceptical.      \\"Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district,\\" Vijendra Tadvi, a farmer who also worked as a driver on the statue's construction site, told BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar.      What went into making the world's tallest statue? |||||","output":"In India, there is a huge statue called the \\"Statue of Unity.\\" It is in a village called Kevadiya in Gujarat state. The statue is very special because it is one of the tallest statues in the world. It is 182 meters (597 feet) tall and made of bronze. The statue is of a man named Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was an important leader when India became free from British rule in 1947. Many people think he did a great job of uniting India. The statue was built to show hope and also to be a popular place for tourists to visit. However, some people are not happy about it. They think that the money spent to build the statue could have been used in a better way, like helping farmers. But for now, the Statue of Unity is the world's tallest statue, and it shows how much people respect Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his work in India."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Here are three girls.

When investing time and emotional energy into a film, one expects the story to reward their commitment with a satisfying, if not always happy, resolution. \\"Disaster Strikes,\\" however, falls short in delivering an engaging or meaningful narrative, leaving the viewer feeling stranded in a sea of poorly-executed plotlines. This review aims to evaluate the numerous shortcomings of the movie that contribute to its underwhelming impact. From the outset, the film's pacing was a major detriment to the overall experience. Rather than easing into the story, the audience was bombarded with rapid-fire exposition, leaving little room for proper introduction to characters and their motivations. The inability to seamlessly establish the narrative context meant that viewers were left to fill in the gaps of poorly-structured storytelling. In addition to the confusing nature of the plot, the main characters lacked depth and relatability. Instead of being engagements with unique viewpoints, many of the characters felt one-dimensional, serving merely as plot devices to drive the story forward. The lack of a fully-realized protagonist prevented the audience from immersing themselves in the emotional journey and ultimately dulled the impact of the film's climax. Moreover, \\"Disaster Strikes\\" failed to deliver in terms of visual effects and cinematography. Though budget restraints may have played a part, it is difficult to overlook the bland use of color and uninspired shot compositions. The film's creators could have utilized innovative techniques to create a more visually captivating experience, but the end result was a lackluster presentation. The previously mentioned issues culminate in the film's disappointing resolution, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. The storyline's loose ends were abundant and unsatisfying, making it nearly impossible to derive any sort of fulfillment or understanding from the conclusion. Upon assessing these aspects of \\"Disaster Strikes,\\" it is difficult to find any redeeming factors that could potentially salvage the experience. The poorly-conceived narrative, lackluster characterization, and subpar visual presentation combine to create an ultimately disappointing film better left unwatched."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence, the speaker discusses how various factors influence whether a patient has a roommate or not including the patient's situation, the availability of rooms, and the hospital's construction. The speaker even provides an example of a situation where one lady had a roommate while another did not. The key phrase connecting the two sentences is \\"it depends on the patient,\\" which highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether patients will have roommates or not.

Please note that neither sentence influences the other as they are independent statements in a multi-choice question. Sentence 1: How do you know if you really love her? Jon looked at the man a long time. This sentence is essentially a question being asked either by the reader, another character, or possibly even Jon himself. It is not a true or false statement that can affect the second sentence. The only information provided is that Jon looked at the man for a long time, which does not provide any clarification or context for the question on if Jon really loves \\"her.\\" Sentence 2: He secretly loved Jon.

Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and triggers moments of self-reflection. Using scanners  , they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then \\"translated\\" the original texts into more \\"straightforward\\", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more \\"challenging\\" essays and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the much plainer versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it was \\"activated\\" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This \\"activation\\" of the mind lasts longer, shifting the brain to a higher speed, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the reader to reflect on their own experiences, which they compare with what they have read. This, according to the researchers, meant that the classic works were more useful than guide books. Philip Davis, an English professor believes \\"The research shows the power of literature to shift thinking patterns, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and adults alike.\\" What is the possible benefit of reading classic works according to the study? A) It would help increase the sale of Shakespeare plays. B) It helps readers learn more difficult grammar. C) It inspires regular readers to think out of the box.

This is useful because only simple molecules can be absorbed by the intestine. - Therefore, if more fluid and enzymes from the liver are pumped into the small intestine, it implies a greater breakdown capacity for food molecules.  - Therefore, this would enhance the breakdown and digestion of more food. - The result would not be less food digested (option B) because an increase in enzymes would facilitate more digestion rather than less.  - The process wouldn't stay unchanged (option C) since the higher enzyme concentration would accelerate the food breakdown process. - Hence, the answer is more (Option A), suggesting that the presence of more liver fluids would lead to more food being digested."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Avoid mood-altering substances. Exercise moderately to calm your nerves. Look your best. Eat healthy","output":"Title: Mastering Public Speaking Anxiety Through Holistic Wellness Practices Public speaking has long been a fear that many people face. The raised heart rate, trembling uncertainty, and apprehensive tension before delivering a speech are familiar feelings to many. However, utilizing a routine of holistic wellness practices can substantially alleviate these symptoms and ensure a successful speech performance. Following a comprehensive strategy that includes ample rest, stress minimization, abstaining from mood-altering substances, moderate exercise, practicing good personal grooming, and maintaining a healthy diet can hold the key to overcoming the fear of public speaking. One of the most fundamental and often overlooked aspects of preparing for a speech is getting enough rest. While there may be an underlying temptation to spend the night before a presentation preparing or revising your speech, remember that your brain needs sufficient rest to function optimally and handle stress. Ample sleep contributes to better memory retention and concentration, crucial pins that hold your speech presentation together. The American Sleep Association states that adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, so make sure you are clocking in those hours, especially before your speaking engagement. Minimizing stress in the hours or days leading up to the event is another pivotal step towards seamless public speaking. Stress response is our body’s way to deal with perceived threats, and it can certainly view the prospect of standing in front of an audience as a threat. The impact of stress can affect cognitive functions such as focus, memory, and judgment, hindering your performance. To manage external stress factors, make a conscious effort to avoid other stressful events or situations before your speech, meditate to balance your thoughts, or practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, that can calm your body's stress response. The use of mood-altering substances such as caffeine and alcohol can seem enticing to many looking for a quick fix for their public speaking anxiety. While these substances might offer temporary reprieve, they can lead to heightened anxiety, memory impairment, and decreased motor control, interfering with your ability to deliver a smooth speech. Instead, consider sipping on calming chamomile tea or a glass of water to stay hydrated and focused. Exercise plays a significant role in not only maintaining a healthy lifestyle but also in managing anxiety and boosting self-confidence. When you engage in moderate physical activity, your body releases endorphins, known as “feel-good hormones,” which can dramatically reduce anxiety and improve mood. A brisk walk, jog, or yoga session before your presentation can help dispel nervous energy and foster a state of calm focus that will aid in your performance. Similarly, how you present yourself can significantly influence your public speaking experience. Looking your best isn’t just about vanity; it’s about feeling confident and comfortable. Dressing appropriately, maintaining basic grooming habits, and wearing clothes that help you feel comfortable, yet professional, can bolster your self-confidence and enable you to command a robust presence when you step onto the stage. Lastly, maintaining a balanced and healthy diet cannot be overstressed. Consuming nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health and cognition. Especially on the day of your speech, avoid heavy meals that can cause lethargy or discomfort. Instead, opt for light meals packed with complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and fresh fruits and vegetables, which provide sustained energy and help keep your brain alert. In conclusion, managing public speaking anxiety is more about a holistic lifestyle approach than just the moment on stage. Incorporating the practices of getting enough rest, minimizing stress, avoiding mood-altering substances, engaging in moderate exercise, maintaining good grooming, and eating a healthy diet can greatly enhance your public speaking ability and ease any lingering nervousness, paving the way for greater confidence and success in your presentation endeavors."},{"instruction":"Question: Who needs to appear at the fake funerals?

That's the take off point for Buddha Mar Gaya - a black comedy about dead bodies, mucho moolah and funerals. Laxmikant Kabadiya aka LK (Anupam Kher), is one of India's richest industrialists, a self made man who's risen from selling scrap to become a construction magnate. His conglomerate is on the verge of a 5000 crore IPO that should make them one of the largest companies in the country. LK's family - comprising of his spinster twin sister Prerna, his two sons Ranjeet and Sameer, their wives Shruti and Anju respectively and Ranjeet's daughters Sanjana and Namrata, and Sameer's son, Pawan, can't stop salivating at the thought of all that money. Unfortunately for all of them fate displays a wicked sense of humour. On the night before the IPO opens, LK dies. The family is distraught and horrified. Not because a loved one has died but because now no one will buy their shares. So, on the advice of their family guru - Vidyut Baba (Om Puri), the family decides to hide the death of LK for a period of two days till the shares are all sold out. Little do they realize the crazy series of events that will follow on account of this duplicity. After all, hiding the death of a man as famous as LK, is a Herculean task. To make matters worse, every time they're ready to announce LK's death, fate intervenes forcing them to keep his death hidden for another couple of days. Which results in them having to announce the death of a fictitious friend or relative of LK's... And stage fake funerals. Which of course means generating dead bodies and worse, getting the dead LK to make appearances at these funerals. Complicating matters further are an inquisitive and greedy servant, the Prime Minister's fixer, a procurer of dead bodies, the paparazzi and for good measure a couple of cops.

Write a summary based on this article: Mexican authorities said late Friday that they had captured a woman wanted in connection with the killing of a pediatric dentist in her Uptown parking garage.      The Mexican attorney general’s office said Brenda Delgado, 33, was captured at a house in Torreón, in Coahuila state. She will be held at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in Mexico City while she awaits extradition proceedings.      The FBI confirmed in a statement that Delgado was taken into custody without incident.      Delgado — who was added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted fugitives list earlier in the week — faces charges of capital murder and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution in connection with the death of Kendra Hatcher.      Hatcher, 35, was fatally shot in the parking garage of an Uptown apartment complex Sept. 2.      Police have arrested the suspected gunman and getaway driver. Delgado, who officials say was jealous of Hatcher, is accused of arranging the hit.      Hatcher’s brother, Neil Hatcher, told KTVT-TV (Channel 11) that he was “tickled pink” when he heard about the arrest.      U.S. and Texas officials had said Wednesday that Delgado, a Mexican citizen, would not face the death penalty if she were detained in Mexico because that nation is opposed to capital punishment.      However, Delgado will face life in prison if convicted, Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk said during a news conference at Dallas FBI headquarters.      “Justice will be served,” she said.      Delgado’s capital murder indictment says that she “and a drug cartel” gave Kristopher Ledell Love drugs and money in exchange for killing Hatcher.      Investigators have said that Delgado, who was training to be a dental hygienist, was jealous of Hatcher. Hatcher was dating Delgado’s ex-boyfriend and had recently traveled to San Francisco to meet his parents.      Police say Love and getaway driver Crystal Cortes followed Hatcher into the parking garage of the Gables Park apartments near Victory Park, where Love ambushed and fatally shot Hatcher.      Delgado, who lived in Pleasant Grove, talked to police once before leaving the country and said she had lent Cortes a Jeep Cherokee that belonged to a friend.      Police have said that they initially didn’t think they had enough evidence to arrest Delgado but also didn’t see a reason to place her under 24-hour surveillance — the cost of which would have been prohibitive.      “Even if we had put surveillance on her and she decided to go to Mexico, we wouldn’t have had probable cause to stop her,” Maj. Max Geron of the crimes against persons division said in October. “We got the [arrest] warrant as soon as we had probable cause.”      Cortes, 24, has said that she didn’t know Hatcher would be killed. She told police that Delgado agreed to pay her 500 to drive Love to rob Hatcher.      She told detectives that Delgado used an iPhone to track Hatcher’s cellphone location before the slaying.      Cortes faces a capital murder charge and is being held at the Dallas County Jail in lieu of 500,000 bail.      Love, 32, was arrested Oct. 2 after police said they found the murder weapon, a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol, under the front seat of his car.      Love faces a capital murder charge and a federal weapons charge and is being held in lieu of 2.5 million bail. He has previously been convicted of aggravated assault, aggravated robbery and burglary of a residence in Tennessee.      Delgado was the ninth woman to be placed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List since its creation in 1950. A reward of 100,000 was being offered for information that led to her arrest.      “Delgado’s addition to the list underscores the violent and calculated nature of the crime she’s accused of committing,” said Thomas M. Class Sr., FBI special agent in charge.      Staff writer Kevin Krause contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Brenda Delgado allegedly hired two men to kill her ex-boyfriend's new lover      Delgado was the ninth woman placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List      (CNN) After months on the run, a woman who allegedly plotted the death of a romantic rival in Texas has been captured in Mexico.      Brenda Delgado orchestrated the murder-for-hire of a Dallas dentist who was dating her former boyfriend, authorities said.      After her accomplices killed the other woman on September 2, Delgado fled to Mexico, according to authorities.      Mexican authorities arrested her Friday, two days after the FBI added her to its list of 10 Most Wanted Fugitives. She was taken into custody without incident in the city of Torreón.      Ninth woman      Read More ||||| Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter      MEXICO CITY (CBSDFW.COM) – The alleged mastermind behind Uptown dentist Kendra Hatcher’s murder — Brenda Delgado — was captured in Mexico.      Mexican authorities searched areas where Delgado has friends and family in the states of San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León and Mexico City. The Attorney General’s Office said Friday she was detained in a house in the city of Torreón, in northern Coahuila state. Delgado was then taken to the Santa Marta Acatitla prison in Mexico City pending extradition proceedings. Part of that extradition agreement between the United States and Mexico will take the death penalty off the table for Delgado. Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk has said Delgado will however, face life in prison.      Kendra Hatcher’s brother, Neil Hatcher said he was notified of Delgado’s arrest and was “tickled pink” by the news.      Hatcher’s sister, Ashley Lipscomb, released the following statement to CBS 11’s Ken Molestina on Saturday evening:      “Thank you to Mexico for helping a girl who simply loved your country and community. We extend our sincerest gratitude to those who assisted in the arrest.      She majored in Spanish and served in Spain, Ecuador, Texas, and the Cuban community in Florida.      Relaxing and rejuvenating in your country was her favorite pastime because she truly felt at home there.      Kendra was a dual-citizen at heart and chose to use her God-given abilities and resources to do nothing but love and inspire people across the globe, with emphasis on the Spanish communities.”      Thank you again for helping when she needed you. What an amazing way to honor her legacy of service and love. We are grateful.”      The FBI added Brenda Delgado to its “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” this week on April 6, 2016. The 33-year-old is the person investigators believe orchestrated the 2015 murder-for-hire of Hatcher.      “The FBI is extremely appreciative of our law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as our local, state, and federal partners, for their tremendous cooperation and collaboration in the capture of Top Ten Fugitive Brenda Delgado,” said Thomas M. Class, Sr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office.      Hatcher was shot and killed after getting out of her vehicle in the parking garage at the Gables Park 17 high-rise apartment building. FBI officials say it was Dallas Police Department investigators who soon suspected Delgado of hiring two co-conspirators to carry out her plan. The man accused of actually gunning down Hatcher, Kristopher Love, is in custody and faces federal charges. The woman accused of driving Love to the parking garage to murder Hatcher, Crystal Cortes, is also in custody.      Thomas M. Class, Sr., Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Dallas Field Office said, “Brenda Delgado was able to effectively manipulate everyone she involved in her calculated scheme. Although she didn’t pull the trigger herself, she is still responsible for the murder.”      Officials say Delgado plotted the murder because she was jealous Hatcher, 35, was dating her ex-boyfriend and had recently been introduced to his parents. The now Most Wanted fugitive initially spoke with investigators about the murder, but officials say she fled the country when it became clear she was a person of interest in the murder case.      A grand jury indicted Delgado for Capital Murder back in October. A federal arrest warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was issued soon after. The indictment said Delgado promised to give Kristopher Love drugs and money, from herself and a drug cartel, to kill the dentist.      Delgado lived in North Texas but is a Mexican citizen. She was born Brenda Berenice Delgado Reynaga, on June 18, 1982. She is the 506th person and the ninth woman to be placed on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives” list.

The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history.

Lynde, who may be best remembered by children as the voice of Templeton the Rat in \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" had a secret life that involved recreational drugs and male prostitutes, the book alleges. But these vices were not connected to his death, which came from a heart attack at age 55. His autopsy found only a small amount of a sexual stimulant in his bloodstream, and there was no evidence of sexual activity. Lynde inspired love and loathing in Hollywood, according to the book.

The case had fuelled suspicions that. the Army, which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost-cutting exercise,. was targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime. payments. And it sparked criticisms that the Government was breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation's duty of care to troops. But today, after significant media. coverage and a petition signed nearly 100,000 supporters, the Ministry. of Defence said Sgt Anderson had been given the chance to take on a new. role in the Army. An MoD spokesman said: 'There have. been a number of inaccuracies reported surrounding an individual soldier. in an online petition. 'We can be clear that the individual. in question has successfully applied for a transfer to another branch. within the Army, and subject to successful completion of training will. not be made redundant. 'The individual is fully aware of this. and has been kept informed throughout the process. We will continue to. work with him to secure his transfer within the Army.' In a statement, Sgt Anderson added:. 'There has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding an. online petition with the aim of securing my pension. 'I was selected for redundancy but. have applied for transfer to another service within the Army. I have. been successful in the application process and am looking forward to. beginning training for my new role.' Poppy: Mrs Anderson has written an open letter to the Prime Minister asking for better treatment for her soldier husband. It comes after Mrs Anderson started an. online petition on change.org asking the Prime Minister to give her. husband his job back that by tonight had been signed by nearly 100,000. people. Mrs Anderson, whose husband has served. in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, wrote on the site: 'When Michael. was informed of his redundancy I felt like my heart had been ripped out,. more for Michael than me. 'Everything he knew and had worked for. from the age of 16 taken away. We had planned on using the pension to. secure a mortgage when we left army accommodation and to support our. young family while Michael established a new career on civvy street. 'After a life of service for our country our family's financial security has now been cruelly snatched away from us.' She said calling it a 'pension' was. incorrect, arguing that the military pension was 'the key financial. promise on which personnel are recruited, retained and promoted'. Sgt Anderson, a father of two, whose. case was first reported by the Mail in July, has been a soldier since he. was 18 years old. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a. casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or. injured troops. He was told in June that he had been. selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer. with a 12-month notice period, ending on June 18 2014. Had he been allowed to work until June. 21, he would have qualified for an immediate pension and tax-free lump. sum worth an estimated £261,278 over his lifetime. Instead he faced a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reached 60. In the preamble to the petition. started by Mrs Anderson, a mental health care manager, she wrote how she. and her husband had felt 'honoured to be part of the Army family' and. said they wanted to continue to be part of it. And now they have the chance after her. husband was offered a transfer to another branch of the Army - an. opportunity that means he will be able to collect his full pension. If Sgt Anderson successful completes the training for the new job, he will now longer face redundancy. And even if he fails the training. programme he will be eligible for his immediate pension due to the time. spent on his ongoing transfer process. The MoD's spokesman added: 'All those made redundant will receive an Armed Forces pension and a generous compensation package. 'Inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere, but those who are close to their immediate pension point ...will receive a larger tax-free lump sum in compensation.' Army pensions are one of the key selling points to would-be recruits, and guarantees retired soldiers a full monthly pension based on their final salary. One of its chief attractions is the fact that contributors to the scheme do not have their salary deducted each month, as in many other pension schemes. After two years of regular service, soldiers are entitled to receive the pension when they are 65. Soldiers who serve for 12 years will receive a tax-free resettlement grant to ease them into their civilian life. And anyone who is over 40 and has served at least 18 years can claim an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army, with a second lump sum when they turn 65. From April 2015 changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme will come in, meaning soldiers will have to work for 20 years rather than 18 before they can qualify for a full pension. The new scheme will also see retired soldiers able to claim at a reduced rate, rather than the full rate, from the age of 55 until they reach the planned state pension age of 67. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A soldier named Sergeant Michael Anderson was almost going to lose a big part of his pension because he was told he would lose his job just a few days before he could get his full pension. He had been a soldier for almost 18 years and needed to work just 72 more hours to qualify for the pension.  Sergeant Anderson and his wife were worried about this because they were counting on the pension, which is like a big savings account, to help them buy a house and take care of their family. Many people thought it was unfair and thought that the Army should treat him better. Luckily, after many people heard about his story and signed a paper saying they wanted him to get his full pension, the Army decided to let him switch to another job within the Army. This means that he will now be able to receive his full pension."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the question and hint, the child who isn't nearsighted is Clarence. He is able to clearly see what is being written on the chalkboard from the back of the classroom, indicating that his distant vision is fine. Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a condition where distant objects appear blurry. Therefore, because Clarence does not exhibit this symptom and can see distant objects clearly, we can conclude that he is not nearsighted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Bulletface Context: Dara Maren is a DEA agent who gets dragged into the seedy underworld of California/Mexico border smuggling in an attempt to protect her younger brother. During a drug deal gone bad, she ends up shooting and killing an undercover ATF agent and is arrested. She's convicted and incarcerated inside a penal colony just outside Tijuana, where the prison officials harvest organs from the inmates. During her incarceration, Dara's brother is murdered by a drug lord who's also using human spinal fluid drained from his victims to create a new DNA-altering drug that turns those who become addicted to it into something not human. As hundreds of dead bodies start turning up along the Mexico border, and with law enforcement and government officials falling victim to its addictive properties as well, an old friend from the FBI manages to bribe the officials in Tijuana to let Dara back out onto the streets in order to bring down the drug lord and avenge her brother's murder. Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Bulletface,\\" prison officials are illegally harvesting organs and human spinal fluid from inmates. Set against the backdrop of a seedy California/Mexico border smuggling underworld, Dara Maren, a DEA agent, struggles to protect her younger brother when she is arrested and incarcerated in a penal colony near Tijuana. The prison officials in this colony are involved in the illicit and inhumane practice of extracting organs from inmates to be sold on the black market. Additionally, a drug lord connected to the prison uses the spinal fluid drained from his victims to develop a new DNA-altering drug. This powerful substance is highly addictive and has the alarming ability to transform those who become dependent on it into something less than human. As the drug's influence spreads and the number of dead bodies continues to rise along the border between Mexico and the United States, the situation becomes critical. Law enforcement and government officials also fall prey to the devastating consequences of the drug addiction. In a desperate attempt to bring down the drug lord and avenge her brother's murder, Dara's old friend from the FBI manages to bribe the corrupt Tijuana prison officials to release Dara. As she becomes re-immersed in the dangerous world of drug smuggling, Dara must navigate treacherous territory to put an end to the organ harvesting and spinal fluid extraction from inmates, as well as stop the production and distribution of the drug. The illegal harvesting of organs and spinal fluid in \\"Bulletface\\" serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the devastating effects of corruption and greed at the expense of innocent individuals.

Question: \\"What rank was Owen at what he did?\\"  Context: \\"The leading naturalist in Britain was the anatomist Richard Owen, an idealist who had shifted to the view in the 1850s that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a divine plan. Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in the Descent of Man (1871).\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Richard Owen held the rank of a leading naturalist and anatomist in Britain during the 19th century. He was a significant figure in the scientific community, known for his expertise in comparative anatomy and paleontology. Owen's views on the history of life evolved over time, shifting in the 1850s to the belief that life's development was a gradual unfolding of a divine plan. As an influential scientist of his time, his perspectives on evolution and human origins were widely considered and debated. In the context provided, Owen was engaged in a heated debate with other prominent scientists, such as Thomas Huxley, Joseph Hooker, and Charles Darwin, who were advocating for different views on evolution and the origins of species. Owen proposed a concept of evolution that involved a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\" with new species appearing by natural birth. This idea rejected natural selection but supported \\"creation by birth.\\" Owen's views were met with both agreement and criticism from his contemporaries. One major disagreement Owen had with his peers, particularly with Huxley, was about the anatomical similarities between apes and humans. Owen held the view that humans were a separate sub-class, while Huxley believed that humans and apes shared more similarities than Owen was willing to accept. This led to a public dispute, famously known as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question,\\" in which Huxley ultimately proved that Owen was incorrect in his assertion that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. In conclusion, Richard Owen was a leading naturalist and anatomist in Britain, who held a high rank due to his expertise and influence in the scientific community. His beliefs and contributions to the understanding of evolution and human origins were central to the discourse of his time. Although his views were challenged and debated by his contemporaries, his work's significance cannot be denied in shaping the scientific discussions and developments of the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - deep dive - fall - lower - below - sun set  Explain why a human would choose \\"sun set\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"sun set\\" to answer the question above for the following reasons: 1. Context: The question is about what happens at the end of the day after the sun has risen. This context is related to the natural progression of a day, which involves the sun's movement.  2. Familiarity: Most humans have experienced and are familiar with the concept of the sun rising and setting in one day, as it is a part of everyday life on Earth. 3. Process of elimination: - Deep dive: This term usually refers to an extensive or detailed examination of a subject, and it does not relate directly to the sun or the end of the day. - Fall: Although the term can be used to describe a decrease or lowering of something, it doesn't necessarily relate to the sun's position at the end of the day as directly as \\"sun set\\" does. - Lower: While \\"lower\\" can be used to describe the sun's movement at the end of the day, it may still not be as precise as the term \\"sun set\\" which specifically and directly means the time when the sun moves below the horizon. - Below: This term by itself does not provide enough context to explain what happens to the sun at the end of the day, and it leaves the reader guessing about what is going below. Thus, after considering the context, familiarity, and eliminating other options, a human would choose \\"sun set\\" as the best answer to the question.

A thinner wire has a higher resistance, making it more difficult for current to flow through it compared to a thicker wire with lower resistance. This increased resistance in thinner wires is due to the smaller cross-sectional area, which forces electrons to more closely interact with the atoms in the wire, leading to collisions and a decrease in the overall current flow. Thicker wires provide a larger cross-sectional area, offering more room for electrons to move, thereby facilitating easier electron flow and lower resistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A suspect in the Thanksgiving night shooting of an 18-year-old at the Riverchase Galleria Mall in Hoover was arrested Thursday in Georgia.      The warrant was issued Wednesday for Erron Martez Dequan Brown, 20, in the shooting. He is charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Brian Wilson, the friend of Emantic “EJ” Bradford Jr., 21, who was shot and killed by police after Wilson was shot. His bond is set at 125,000.      The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed to AL.com Brown has been arrested in South Fulton. Brown was quickly identified as a suspect in the Nov. 22 shooting of Brian Wilson. Authorities withheld his identity while law enforcement officers searched for him.      The U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force in Georgia was assisted by Alabama’s Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Authorities said they captured Erron Martez Brown, 20, about 9:30 a.m. Thursday on Highwind Way in South Fulton.      Brown will be taken to the South Fulton Police Precinct, where he will be questioned by local and Alabama authorities. U.S. Marshals said Brown was staying at a relative’s house when he was arrested.      Jefferson County District Attorney Danny Carr said while charges have been brought against Brown, the state investigation is not complete and remains ongoing. \\"We are confident ALEA is working to complete the investigation in a timely manner,'' Carr said. “However, in light of the fact that so many people were present in the mall that evening, witness interviews are still ongoing.”      Court records show Brown previously was arrested in Madison County on May 18, 2017 on a first-degree robbery charge, but that charge was dismissed.      Hoover may share mall shooting information if state won’t release video      The shooting happened late Thanksgiving night at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover. Police said it began when two men got into a physical altercation and one of the men - now identified as Brown - pulled out a handgun and shot the other man - Wilson. Wilson was shot at least once in the stomach, and taken to a nearby hospital where he remains in serious condition. A 12-year-old bystander, Molly Davis, was also shot and taken to Children’s Hospital by a Hoover Fire Department rescue squad. She has since been released. Authorities have not said who fired the shots that injured Molly.      Two officers who were providing security at the mall heard the gunfire and approached the area. They spotted a suspect waving a pistol and shot him. The man, Emantic “EJ” Bradford Jr., 21, died at the scene.      Hoover police initially portrayed Bradford as the mall gunman and said officers acted heroically to “take out the threat” within seconds of shots being fired in the crowded mall. They later retracted the statement, and said while Bradford was seen with a handgun, evidence indicates he was not the person who shot the 18-year-old and 12-year-old bystander.      Shortly after news of the arrest broke, ALEA spokeswoman Robyn Bryan said the ivestigation is ongoing, including the officer-involved shooting from the same evening and location.      Hoover officials apologize to E.J. Bradford’s family for saying he was shooter      \\"The cooperation of the Hoover Police Department and Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office has aided in the investigation and the expediency of identifying Brown and effecting his arrest. The SBI is also grateful for the patience shown by the City of Hoover in this process,'' she said.      \\"It is highly likely that prematurely releasing information, including video evidence, would have hampered the investigation’s progress thus far, even to the point of deterring key witnesses,'' Bryan said in a prepared statement. \\"As other witnesses continue to come forward, it is imperative for the integrity of the investigation that SBI continue to keep confidential information Agents obtain.      “SBI will continue to work efficiently, thoroughly and impartially to bring all relevant facts to light to provide the DA with the most accurate facts and evidence possible in this case,'' said SBI Director John Q. Hamm, also in a prepared statement. \\"This is not just SBI’s commitment to the people of Hoover and Jefferson County, but SBI’s commitment to the citizens of Alabama in all investigations SBI undertakes.”      Once Brown’s extradition from Georgia has been affirmed, Brown will be booked into the Jefferson County Jail, Birmingham, under a 150,000 bond. Additional charges are expected as the investigation progresses. Once agents have completed the investigation, the file in its entirety will be turned over to the Tenth Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office.      The City of Hoover and the Hoover Police Department expressed their appreciation to U.S. Marshal Marty Keely and the task force for their role in Brown’s arrest. “This is an important milestone in the continued work to find answers about what happened in last Thursday’s tragic incident,'' according to a statement released Thursday afternoon.      The Bradford family attorney, Ben Crump, issued this statement following the arrest of Brown: “We are gratified at the arrest of a suspect in the Thanksgiving Riverchase Galleria mall shooting, further underscoring the unjust death of EJ Bradford Jr. at the hands of an off-duty Hoover police officer who was serving as mall security. Right now, EJ’s family is focused on planning their son’s funeral, to be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday at Boutwell Memorial Auditorium. They look forward to reviewing unaltered video evidence of the shooting next week, after properly remembering and honoring EJ and enduring the painful process of burying their son.”      Anyone with information regarding the Galleria shooting is asked to call ALEA at 334-462-9163. ||||| Trevor Noah, speaking to his Daily Show audience Tuesday night during an impassioned side monologue on a recent Alabama police shooting, questioned the Second Amendment’s inclusion of black Americans.      Addressing the recently admitted police killing of 21-year-old Emantic Bradford Jr., Noah wondered aloud why these situations continue to remain prevalent among American law enforcement. \\"So the question I ask myself is, how does this shit keep happening?\\" he said. \\"That's what they did here, they ran in they shot the guy and they were like 'We got him!' What's wild about the story for me is, even if we work in a world that police truly believe he was the shooter, how many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down, you know what I mean?\\"      After referencing the outcomes of the Aurora and Charleston mass shootings, Noah continued: \\"There were so many things that bugged me about this story,\\" he said. \\"From the looks of it, this was a good guy with a gun. That's what they always say, right? 'The good guy with a gun stops the crime.' But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don't get any of the benefits.\\"      POST CONTINUES BELOW      \\"At this point,\\" Noah later added, \\"you start to realize that, really, the Second Amendment is not intended for black people.\\"      See Noah's full Daily Show segment on the shooting up top.      In a recent interview with CNN, April Pipkins—Emantic Bradford Jr.'s mother—said an open-casket funeral service was likely not possible due to police shooting her son in the face. \\"I will never be able to see my son's face again or to look into his eyes or to hear him say, 'Mom, I love you,''' she said.      While Hoover police originally asserted that Emantic Bradford Jr. had been the gunman involved in a mall shooting, they later changed their story. The actual gunman, per the most recent reports, is apparently still at large. ||||| After a young black man was shot by police at a mall, a community is traumatised as the family demands answers      When gunshots were fired near a Footaction store at an upscale mall in Hoover, Alabama, Emantic Bradford Sr heard about it on the local news. After dinner on Thanksgiving, his 21-year-old son and namesake, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr, had gone to that very mall.      So Bradford Sr, a retired Birmingham jail employee, called his son.      Ring. Ring. Ring. Then voicemail.      Though he was exhausted from a latest bout of chemotherapy, Bradford Sr called the Hoover police department in the early hours of Friday morning.      “My mind was on my baby,” he told the packed crowd of mostly African Americans at Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist church on Tuesday night, just a few miles from mall.      The Hoover police department told Bradford Sr they would call him back in 10 minutes.      But no one called back.      At 3.43am, Bradford Sr called them again.      “I can’t tell you anything,” the person who answered the phone told him, transferring the call to the county, then dispatch and finally a detective on the scene.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emantic Bradford Jr was fatally shot by Birmingham, Alabama, police when they wrongly believed he was the gunman in a shopping mall shooting. Photograph: Emantic Bradford Sr/AP      Bradford Sr would, at last, get an answer to where his son was.      “He told me direct on the phone. I asked: ‘Is that my child?’ He said: ‘Yes, that’s your son.’”      At the time the family found out their son had died, the day after Thanksgiving, the mall reopened at 6am for Black Friday sales.      “I called them at 12.30[am]. My child was dead at 9[pm],” Bradford Sr said , his voice cracking, as he stood with family members and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, staring at the crowd gathered in the church.      In that time, the city of Hoover, Hoover police and the Riverchase Galleria mall posted updates on social media and held news conferences. But no one had called the dead man’s family.      The tragic death has divided a community and the country. Police in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham which is a city symbolic of the civil rights struggle and the fight against racial segregation, shifted the narrative multiple times about how Bradford had died. First, he was identified as the suspect in the shooting. Then they said he wasn’t the suspect but had brandished a gun. Then police backed off that claim too. The real shooter, meanwhile, remains at large.      The incident is resonant of many cases of police shootings of young black men, reinforcing a notion that they must behave differently from other races in America’s public spaces – merely to avoid being shot by law enforcement. As the late-night comic Trevor Noah noted in a passionate commentary on the case: “The second amendment is not intended for black people.”      Bradford’s death has left many people traumatised, especially those who witnessed the shooting. Rashad Billingsley, 18, an employee of the national guard, had passed two police officers at Footaction shortly after 9pm. He wanted to buy a new pair of red sneakers.      Before he could turn his attention to the shoes, he heard two gunshots, just 25ft away. Seconds later, he heard more. (He is unsure about how many.) Billingsley ushered dozens into the back hallway of the store, and helped tend to a 12-year-old girl shot in the back.      'They executed him': police killing of Stephon Clark leaves family shattered Read more      He was one of the last to leave the mall, walking out with the older sister and grandmother of the young girl who was shot. Outside Footaction, they saw a young black man covered in blood.      “Me and her sister were walking out and she [saw] him out of her peripheral vision. She started crying … I put my arm around her so she couldn’t see the body,” he said, fiddling with his watch.      In the immediate aftermath, police did not contact Billingsley, he says. As of Tuesday Billingsley said they still had not spoken to him.      Police decisions in the wake of the shooting have come under heavy criticism. That night Hoover police captain Gregg Rector described a physical altercation, an exchange of gunfire, and the death of a suspect engaged by police officers.      By Friday morning, Hoover police would identify the dead man as “a 21-year-old male from Hueytown”.      Hours later, police released his name as the shooter – before backtracking. They accused Bradford of “brandishing” a gun – and then walked back that description. “This is not a change in the characterization of what he was doing with the gun at the time but rather an attempt to further explain it,” a city spokesperson said in an email.      Four days after Bradford’s death, in a joint release with the city of Hoover, police said the shooter “is still at large” – though they provided no description, indirectly admitting they falsely accused Bradford. They offered sympathy to the family, but did not apologize in the statement.      Grasping for change on America's most violent streets: 'We must stop killing' Read more      The police officer involved in the shooting has yet to be identified by the city or police. “The officer is on paid administrative leave as per normal procedures in a case such as this. This officer has been employed by Hoover police department since 2017 but had several years of police experience prior to that,” the email stated.      The timeline remains unclear: officials have released contradictory narratives.      Crump, the civil rights attorney, said: “It is so troubling when you think of all the black men across America who have been killed because they moved a certain way. They have a cellphone, it was dark and they couldn’t see.”      He then listed African American shooting victims whose families he has represented: Michael Brown in Ferguson; Botham Jean in Dallas; and Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.      Crump grew visibly angry as he referenced white, male shooting suspects taken alive by police in recent years: Nikolas Cruz at Parkland this year; and Dylann Roof, who killed nine African American worshippers at a church in Charleston in 2015.      Crump said: “When it comes to [Bradford], who several witnesses say was trying to help them escape, help them get out of harm’s way, help them get to safety, police [don’t] see a good guy with a gun, he’s a black man with a gun.”      The second amendment is a recipe for police killings | Michael Wood Read more      Though the Hoover mall is private property and prohibits firearms, gun laws in Alabama are unclear. State law allows carrying a pistol on private property with a concealed weapon permit. According to Crump, multiple eyewitnesses have come forward, telling him many people inside the mall pulled out guns when the shots rang out.      Multiple vigils and protests have sprouted up, and people have demanded officials “release the video”. According to the police, all available video footage is in the possession of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) for the duration of the investigation.      Crump told the Guardian: “Nobody has seen the video and that’s the problem because they lied already to this family about proclaiming to the world, assassinating his character while assassinating this person.”      The ALEA has not responded to the Guardian’s inquiry.      On Monday night, Hoover police officers lined up in front of the station, watching a small crowd of protesters, many carrying signs eliciting deja vu of other officer-involved shooting protests. “Hoover PD believes the second amendment only applies to white civilians,” read one sign. “Black Lives Matter,” read another. “Release the videotapes,” another demanded.      Adrienne Matthews, 36, brought her six-year-old and 10-year-old to the protest. “It’s overwhelming, it’s a lot. There’s a lot of [Emantics] out here.”      A white police officer whispered to a protester: “I wish it didn’t have to be like this.”      Black Lives Matter: birth of a movement | Wesley Lowery Read more      “We want justice for EJ,” the crowd chanted, using Bradford’s nickname.      Bradford Jr’s cousin, Taunya Bradford McDonald, turned to a police officer and asked: “Why didn’t you have the decency to go to my family and say, ‘Hey, your son was murdered?”      She asked: “Do you have any children?” The officer nodded.      She continued: “If this happened to your child, wouldn’t you want to know what happened?”      Sure, he said to her, still nodding. “I would want answers, just like you,” he began. “We’re human beings, we’re parents, we’re sons, we’re daughters,” he said.      Earlier that day, a vigil was held at Veterans Park. Many pastors spoke, but the most resounding words came from a white pastor, David Barnhart of St Junia Methodist church in Birmingham.      He said: “Systemic racism is not a black people problem. These are not problems we can help by claiming we don’t see color. These are not problems we can fix by claiming all lives matter.”      On Tuesday, five days after their son was shot, Bradford’s family received a call from Hoover police, Crump told the Guardian. The family has also received the body of their dead son, in preparation for his funeral, where the Rev Jesse Jackson will deliver the eulogy, he added.      It was all too much for Bradford’s mother. She was the last to address the crowd on Tuesday evening in Birmingham. After holding up a picture of her son, she couldn’t get past her first thought.      “Thanksgiving will never be the same,” April Pipkins began. She paused, looked at the ground, rubbed her temples, then collapsed. Faith leaders encircled her, praying as she lay on the floor.      The meeting ended and people filed out. And around the corner of the famed church, the mother of a dead young black man was helped on to a stretcher, away from the departing crowd.      Her son’s funeral is Saturday morning. ||||| (CNN) April Pipkins is still at a loss for words over the events that led up to her son's fatal shooting Thanksgiving night -- and as outrage grows, she wants people to know that Emantic Bradford Jr. was a loving man.      The 21-year-old was killed by a police officer in a case of mistaken identity during a shooting at Alabama's largest enclosed mall Thursday night.      Officers initially thought Bradford fired the rounds at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover that left an 18-year-old and a 12-year-old hospitalized, Hoover police spokesman Capt. Gregg Rector said in a statement.      \\"I will never be able to see my son's face again or to look into his eyes or to hear him say, 'Mom, I love you,'\\" Pipkins said of her son, adding that he may not be able to have an open-casket funeral because he was shot in the face.      \\"I am just at a loss of words right now,\\" she said.

Movie title: The Quiet Man Movie plot: Sean and Mary Kate In the 1920s, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, travels to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm and his birthplace in Inisfree. He meets and falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), the sister of the bullying, loud-mouthed landowner Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). Danaher, who had wanted the farm himself, is angry that the Widow Tillane (herself angered by Danaher's admission that he had discussed her in the local pub) accepts Sean's bid, and retaliates by refusing consent for his sister to marry. Several town locals, including the Catholic priest, Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), conspire to trick him into believing that the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) wants to marry him, but only if Mary Kate is no longer living in his house. After learning the truth on Sean and Mary Kate's wedding day, an enraged Will refuses to give his sister her dowry which is made up of a large sum of money and her family possessions passed down from her mother. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride. She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean. Angered and shamed by Sean's refusal to confront her brother and demand what is legally hers, she brands him a coward, and, despite living together, they are quickly estranged as husband and wife. In the morning they find that others in the village had visited Will and pressured him to return Mary Kate's furniture, but not her money.

Please answer a question about the following article about Planck constant: The assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction: the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule, the Stefan–Boltzmann law (1879–84). But it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature, so that \\"white hot\\" is hotter than \\"red hot\\". Nevertheless, Wilhelm Wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures, by using the principle of adiabatic invariance. At each different temperature, the curve is moved over by Wien's displacement law (1893). Wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object, which was correct at high frequencies (short wavelength) but not at low frequencies (long wavelength). It still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has (see diagram).

By Daily Mail Reporter Last updated at 5:04 PM on 21st June 2011 New details have emerged of how seriously the British government was bracing itself for a full scale nuclear crisis in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. Documents show how advisers rushed to work out how bad the crisis might get, and the plans drawn up for 'the worst case scenario' to protect British citizens - including the British Embassy in Tokyo issuing iodine pills to expats and visitors in the capital and Sendai, 70 miles from Fukushima. The government's emergency committee Cobra were also on standby to screen passengers landing at Heathrow from Japan for radioactive contamination, it has been revealed. However, the accident was not expected to be as bad as OPTIONS: - British. - British Embassy. - Chernobyl. - Cobra. - Daily Mail. - Fukushima. - Heathrow. - Japan. - Sendai. - Tokyo.","output":"the Chernobyl disaster, which took place in 1986 in Ukraine. Nonetheless, the British government understood the severity of the situation at Fukushima, and they did not want to take any chances when it came to the safety of their citizens, both in Japan and those who might be returning to the United Kingdom. In the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, British experts in various fields, including nuclear safety, public health, and disaster response, were quickly assembled to assess the situation and provide guidance to the government on how to best handle the potential threat. This careful and well-coordinated response is a testament to the UK's commitment to ensuring the wellbeing of their people in the face of a potential nuclear crisis. One of the key actions taken by the British Embassy in Tokyo was the distribution of iodine pills to British expats and visitors in both the capital city and Sendai, which was located just 70 miles from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The iodine pills were meant to protect the individuals from the harmful effects of radioactive iodine, which can be released into the environment during a nuclear event. Radioactive iodine can be absorbed by the thyroid gland and lead to thyroid cancer or other serious health complications. Distributing these pills was a proactive measure to minimize the potential health impact on British citizens who were in close proximity to the affected area. Another major plan that was put in place as part of the UK's response to the Fukushima disaster was the activation of the government's emergency committee Cobra. This committee was prepared to screen passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport from Japan for any radioactive contamination. This step was essential to ensuring that individuals who had potentially been exposed to radiation during their time in Japan were identified and appropriately treated or quarantined to protect the wider population in the UK. The detailed documentation on the British government's response to the Fukushima disaster highlights the importance that national authorities place on preparing for and addressing nuclear crises. The UK's efforts to protect their citizens extended beyond their borders and demonstrated their resolve to take all necessary measures to minimize the potential impact of such an event on their people. Although the Fukushima disaster did not reach the magnitude of the Chernobyl catastrophe, the British government's response showcases their commitment to the safety and wellbeing of their nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Timon and Pumbaa watch the original film in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to his scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory (going way back, to before the beginning of the first movie). Timon is a social outcast in his meerkat colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother Ma, Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators. One day, he is assigned as a sentry, but his daydreaming nearly leads to the near-death of his Uncle Max by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets Rafiki, who teaches him about \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and advises him to \\"look beyond what you see\\". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon. The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively passes gas, causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and Scar's conspiring with the hyenas.

Former FBI Director James Comey said in his testimony, 'Lordy, I hope there are tapes'      Washington (CNN) For President Richard Nixon, the controversy over his secret White House tape recordings began with a break-in at the Watergate Hotel. If President Donald Trump is also keeping recordings of his conversations, any controversy over those will have begun with a tweet.      On May 12, three days after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump tweeted: \\"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\\"      Since then, the possible existence of audio recordings of Oval Office conversations have been a topic of conversation among many on Capitol Hill. The House intelligence committee has called on both the White House and Comey to hand over any material related to its Russia investigation, including memos and recordings, by June 23.      But two questions remain: Are there actually audio recordings?

The agency’s response to a freedom of information request submitted by The Wall Street Journal doesn’t exclude the possibility that recordings could have been created by another entity.      The Secret Service handled recording systems within the White House for past presidents, including Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.      The question of a White House recording system has lingered for more than a month since Mr. Trump first raised the possibility in a provocative tweet about former FBI Director James Comey.      In recent days, the two men have offered differing accounts of whether Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey in private conversations within the White House complex to ease off the FBI’s probe of former national security adviser Mike Flynn.      On Friday, Mr. Trump kept the tapes mystery alive, telling reporters in the White House Rose Garden, “I’ll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future.” He added, “Oh, you’re going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, don’t worry.”      White House aides have declined to answer questions about whether there are tapes, with press secretary Sean Spicer saying he was “not aware” and his deputy, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, saying she didn’t know and then quipping she would “look under the couches” to check. At a cabinet meeting Monday, Mr. Trump didn’t respond to a shouted question from a reporter about whether there were tapes.      And at the White House daily briefing on Monday, Mr. Spicer said: “The president made clear in the Rose Garden last week that he would have an announcement shortly.”      The Secret Service on Monday sent its reply to a May 15 request from the Journal that sought recordings or transcripts of any recordings made after Jan. 20 within the White House.      “In response to your request, the Secret Service has conducted a reasonable search for responsive records,” the agency wrote. “It appears, from a review of Secret Service’s main indices, that there are no records pertaining to your request that are referenced in these indices.”      Such records would typically be subject to the Presidential Records Act, and turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration at the end of a president’s time in office.      The National Archives and Records Administration said in response to a request from the Journal that any presidential records aren’t subject to FOIA while the president is in office.      Most parts of the White House itself are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.

There is a little girl involved. 2. The little girl is standing. 3. There is a snowman present. 4. The snowman is taller than the girl. Now, let's look at the sentence in question: \\"A human standing.\\"  This sentence is a very general statement, which only mentions that there is a human who is standing. It does not provide specific details about the human, such as their size, gender, or location. Comparing the two sentences, we can conclude that \\"A human standing\\" is a true sentence, as the little girl from the initial sentence is, in fact, a human. Moreover, she is not just a human, but a human who is standing. However, it is crucial to consider that the sentence \\"A human standing\\" is very vague and does not convey any specific information about the human in question. Therefore, while the sentence is true as it relates to the initial statement, it lacks context and specificity when considered as a standalone sentence.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the last names of the two people who Palmer said were obvious influences to Curtis? from the following article ?  Curtis was the band's sole lyricist, and he typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis's imagery and word choice often referenced \\"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\\". In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \\"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.\\" Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that \\"Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,\\" while noting that \\"the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.\\" Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were \\"obvious influences\\" to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse.Curtis was unwilling to explain the meaning behind his lyrics and Joy Division releases were absent of any lyric sheets. He told the fanzine Printed Noise, \\"We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\\" The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis' lyrics. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they \\"just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing.

Write an article based on this summary: Campaigners against plans to build a row of 30 colourful beach huts on a stretch of shoreline in Moray hope to take their fight to the Court of Session. Article:","output":"Title: A Battle Beyond the Beach: Moray Shoreline Campaigners Head to Court of Session The sleepy, picturesque coastline of Moray in Scotland is home to stunning landscapes, rich history, and a welcoming community. However, recent plans to construct a row of 30 colourful beach huts has sparked a controversial debate that has extended far beyond the sand and splendour of the Moray shore. The said proposal has faced strong opposition from a group of campaigners who have sworn to take their fight to the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme court, in order to contest the potential impact that the construction could have on the shoreline's natural beauty, local residents, and the environment.  It all began when a development company submitted plans to build a series of striking, colourfully-designed beach huts on the shoreline of Moray. The project was deemed an attractive addition to the popular coastal area that could potentially boost tourism and provide revenue opportunities to local businesses. However, this seemingly innocent and vibrant proposal swiftly turned into a major source of contention among locals and environmentalists alike. The group of campaigners opposing the project argue that the construction of these beach huts will significantly alter the landscape, disrupt the natural habitat of local wildlife, and also reduce the scenic value of the Moray coastline. Furthermore, they claim that the increased tourism brought on by the huts would exacerbate existing crowd issues at the shoreline, putting infrastructure under strain, and adding to a rise in noise and waste pollution. On the other hand, proponents of the project present a different perspective. They believe that the beach huts, beyond offering tourists an appealing design aesthetic, would also create new job opportunities for the local area, boosting Moray's economy and increasing its appeal to visitors. In the midst of this heated and emotionally-charged conflict, the campaigners against the beach huts construction have ultimately decided to wage a legal battle in the Court of Session to reverse the approval given to the project. According to them, the due process in approving the plans has not been followed correctly and giving a nod to the construction could set a dangerous precedent for similar development projects on Scotland's coastlines in the future. Notwithstanding the merit of both arguments, the decision of the Court of Session would certainly set a benchmark for how much importance is being given to environmental concerns, local sentiments, and democratic deliberation in the face of potential commercial gains.  As locals and environmentalists wait with bated breath for the Court of Session to weigh in on this contentious issue, the debate over the proposed beach huts has ignited an even larger discussion beyond the Moray shores - the question of how to balance sustainable tourism, environmental protection, and local community needs in the face of modern-day development challenges. While we may not have a definitive answer to this question, the Moray shoreline case serves as a vital reminder that the decisions we make today, in seeking to find the right balance between progress and preservation, will have rippling effects on our landscapes, communities, and future generations for years to come. No matter the outcome of the legal battle, one thing remains certain: the controversy surrounding the Moray beach huts has left an indelible mark on Scotland's coastal communities and has ignited a much-needed conversation about the importance of preserving the authenticity and beauty of our cherished shorelines."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process: - A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water - Eventually all of the floodwater will be slowly released into the river without causing any flood damage.

Available choices: I. negative; II. positive; Short movie review: an unsuccessful attempt  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"In this case, the critic's view of the movie is negative. The phrase \\"an unsuccessful attempt\\" implies that the short movie did not reach its intended goals or achieve its expected potential. The critic seems to believe that the film was not successful in delivering its message or story effectively. Overall, the tone of the review indicates that the individual did not have a positive experience while watching the movie. It is essential to note that reviews can vary greatly from one person to another, and a negative review does not necessarily mean that everyone will have the same opinion about the film. However, the critic's specific mention of an \\"unsuccessful attempt\\" clearly indicates that they did not enjoy the movie, and they likely would not recommend it to others. This suggests that the overall interest, plot development, character depth, cinematic technique, and other elements of the film may not have come together well for this critic. When considering the available choices of either I. negative or II. positive, it is evident that the critic was thinking negatively of the movie. This information can be helpful in understanding the particular perspective of the critic and whether or not the film may be enjoyable for individual preferences. However, it is essential to keep in mind that movies are subjective, and what may not work for one person could resonate strongly with another. In conclusion, based on the short movie review mentioning \\"an unsuccessful attempt,\\" the critic's thoughts on the film can be categorized as negative. While this may affect the movie's perception for some potentially interested viewers, it is a reminder that opinions on art forms such as film can greatly differ. Seeking a variety of opinions and possibly sampling the movie before investing time and emotional investment in it can provide a better overall understanding and ultimately more satisfaction in the viewer's movie-watching experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How drug cartels are like big box stores In his new book Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel, Britain editor for The Economist,Tom Wainwright argues that drug cartels have taken cues from big corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonalds, on everything from creating brand value to outsourcing. He also says governments are getting the economics of the drug trade wrong when it comes to the war on drugs. Here's his conversation with Brent. BRENT BAMBURY: Tom Wainwright, you visited the three countries where cocaine originates: Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. And governments there are aggressively destroying coca plantations. It's a kind of ground war that's trying to damage the cartels and the cocaine business. But the price of cocaine hasn't changed in twenty years. So why isn't this ground war working? TOM WAINWRIGHT: Well on the face of it looks as if it's working rather well. When you go there and you see these guys in action ripping up the coca plants and dumping weedkiller on them. But the trouble is, the price in the United States and Canada are and year hasn't really changed much at all. And the reason is that the coca itself, although it is the principal ingredient of cocaine, it doesn't really actually make much of the final price. Picture the art market. If you want to drive up the price of paintings. You might say well paint is the main ingredient of painting so let's try and double the price of a box of paint. If you did that and a box of paints cost one hundred dollars rather than fifty dollars, you wouldn't expect the price of a million dollar painting to double to two million dollars right? The real value of cocaine lies in the fact that it smuggled thousands of miles. The actual raw ingredient isn't really where the value lies. Even if you do manage to increase the price of drugs. Demand on the whole stays pretty pretty steady. The consumption doesn't really change. And so all you really end up doing is increase the value of the criminal market. That's why I think it would be much better to focus on the demand side because if you can cut consumption if you can persuade people not to take those drugs, then they'll take fewer of them. And it will drive down the price. BB: Some of the economic models that you create to describe the supply side are pretty interesting. You compare the relationship between the growers and the cartels to the business model of Wal-Mart. Why is that? TW: If you look at Wal-Mart you find that even if there's a big interruption to the supply of one of their products -- so let's say the harvest for apples fails, miraculously the price of apples in the store tends to stay pretty much the same. And the suppliers complain that they are the ones who really suffer. And the reason, it's claimed, that this happens is that Wal-Mart has what's called a monopsony. So effectively a monopoly on buying these products. And what this means is that the farmers can't offer the product to anybody else at a higher price. Wal-Mart is really the only buyer in town and so they have to continue giving the product to Wal-Mart at the price that Wal-Mart demands. Something vaguely similar is happening actually in the cocaine business. In the areas where coca leaf is grown you find a single cartel or a single armed group is the only buyer of coca leaf in town and so if there's an interruption to the supply, the coca farmers aren't able to increase their prices because there's only one buyer and that means that the people who suffer from the efforts to destroy coca crops and not the drug cartels. It's the farmers in places like Bolivia who grow the stuff and earn a dollar a day. Robes with Maltese crosses, guns, munitions and Knights Templar paraphernalia are shown after a training camp was discovered following a firefight between Mexican army soldiers and gunmen in the woods near the town of Santa Gertrudis in July 2011. (Associated Press) BB: You find lots of parallels to respectable business practices in the cartels' business models. The Zetas are one of Mexico's most and notorious cartels. And you compare their growth to that of McDonald's restaurants. So what makes those two similar? TW: Well quite often you find when the Mexican police raid a branch of the Zetas, they go in and they find all this branded stuff. It's incredible. The Zetas have these baseball caps with the letters Z on them. And I should say that Zeta is just the Spanish for the letter Z. And so that's their logo. And so they find the branded baseball caps and t-shirts they find all kinds of things like this and the way the gang has spread is very similar to the way in which any other franchise spreads. The main headquarters licenses the brand -- the name Zetas to local criminal groups. And those criminal gangs can use the name. Which helps them a lot in their extortion efforts. And in return these groups return a share of their profits to the main main headquarters and that's how they manage to grow so quickly. BB: You went to Juarez, Mexico at the height of the violence there. And you say that the cartels there were warring over control of the border crossings to bring drugs by land into the world's largest market for these drugs which is the United States. So the human cost is extremely high. How would you change that? TW: People are coming up with various different ways of trying to tackle the drug problem and one of the most interesting ones at the moment actually is what's going on in a few American States and in Uruguay and soon, we're told in Canada or and that's this experiment with legalization. The idea there is to take the market out of the hands of the cartels. And in the case of Mexico for instance there are some cartels which rely on marijuana for nearly half of their revenues. And by legalizing the drug and putting it in the hands of ordinary businesses that market has been removed from those cartels and we're already actually seeing evidence that the Mexican cartels are really suffering as a result of this. If you go to places like Tijuana which is right on the border with the United States, the police there are more frequently finding very very large dumps of marijuana stashed there which it seems the cartels are having difficulty selling north of the border. One observation that I made during the book is that people think that they can reduce the risk of violence spilling over into the United States by closing down border crossings. In fact I think the economic logic suggests the opposite. If you have more border crossings. Then it means that the premium on controlling each one is greatly reduced and so the need for cartels to fight over one city or another is diminished. DATE IMPORTED:August 10, 2010Military officers count money seized during an operation at a military zone on the outskirts of Monterrey August 10, 2010. The army seized 27,211 and 16,539,690 million pesos (1,306,290) in drug money, three vehicles, jewellery, weapons, 200 kilos of packed marijuana, a minor quantity of cocaine and eight detainees during an operation in the suburb of Guadalupe, according to local media. REUTERS/Tomas Bravo (Tomas Bravo/Reuters) BB: In Mexico, you argue that cartels win over locals by carrying out acts of corporate social responsibility. Can you tell me about the cleaning lady that you met Mexico City and how she got involved with a cartel? TW: This was a lady who was in her perhaps seventies or eighties nd she wasn't the kind of person that you would normally expect to be involved in organized crime at all. She was a very kind of friendly, cozy kind of person. And when I went to interview her and she told me that she was planning to have somebody murdered. And I said why are you doing this what's going on? The problem was that in her neighbourhood there was a gang of criminals that was going around robbing people's homes and beating people up and in some cases killing people. And local people had gone to the police and said look, you've got to do something about this. You've got to stop these guys. And the police were corrupt they were inefficient they were lazy they did nothing. And so the local drug cartel stepped in and said 'hey look we're quite good at sorting out this kind of thing you know we can take care of this problem'. And there last I heard, they were about to take care of it. This is the kind of thing that the cartels sometimes do to try and win over the support of local people by, for instance, building churches and building sports fields and things. It helps to persuade some people that they're not all bad and it's important to be clear that they are very much all bad. BB: But for people in poverty the cartels are extremely attractive. Especially young people. Tell me about the young assassin that you met in Guatemala. TW: Sure well I was in Guatemala looking at the way in which some of these cartels do a kind of off-shoring and seeking cheaper places to do business. And this was a guy that I met he was I believe about eighteen years old although he looked so much younger. He'd been suffering from malnutrition which had stunted his growth. And I remember as he was describing to me his job, which was working as a hit man, I saw that he was wearing children sized shoes with velcro straps. It was the most extraordinary contrast of innocence and terrible experience. And the way that the cartels had taking advantage of this guy really illustrated the way in which they move into countries where the cost of employing people to do this kind of work is low where the rule of law is very very weak. BB: A chapter of your book is devoted to to another parallel drug selling system and that's the dark web on sites like the now defunct Silk Road. Tell me how those sites have had an impact on the business and the the practices of the cartels. TW: In just the same way that Amazon.com for instance has made life much harder for book stores, the dark web and sites like the Silk Road has made life much harder for street drug dealers. They offer drugs at lower prices and they offer them a higher quality. And there's this sort of feedback mechanism where when you go on to the site, they look a lot like a site like e-Bay for instance. People can leave reviews of the products and to the established dealers this represents a big new competitor because for many people it's going to seem easier to buy drugs online like that and safer and more reassuring than it is walking down a dark alley with a stranger. And so I think the cartels actually have a real threat on their hands with this. BB: In April the UN's going to host a special assembly about fighting the global trade in drugs. What's one immediate thing that you think governments could do to disrupt the cartels right now and to make things safer. TW: Well the big step would be legalization but I think for countries that aren't ready to do anything quite like that there are lots of smaller things that they could do. And one of those really lies in prisons. That's one of the most extraordinary experiences that I had when I was reporting this book. I went to visit one of the leaders of one of the main drug dealing gangs in El Salvador. He was in jail at the time although it wasn't stopping him from running his business it seemed. And he was one of these extraordinary guys covered in tattoos literally from head to toe. And we sat down and we talked business. And he was complaining that one of the great problems for him is with human resources -- that they find it very difficult to hire new people because of course, they're continually losing employees to to murder or to arrest. But fortunately for them, we've invented these things called prisons which are collections of unemployed young men with criminal records and absolutely nothing to do, who were there at the disposal of the cartels. And if you're not a member of one of these gangs when you go into prison then you certainly will be by the time you leave. And so I think one area where governments could probably do more is to make these prisons less conducive to a gang joining. And the way to do that is to make them safer so people don't need to join gangs for their own protection. BB: Tom Wainwright, thank you for being with us. TW: Thank you very much. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about an interview with Tom Wainwright, the author of the book \\"Narconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel.\\" He explains how drug cartels have taken cues from big corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonald's in terms of creating brand value, outsourcing, and other business strategies. Wainwright also discusses how governments are not effectively addressing the economics of the drug trade in their efforts to fight against it.

The commission had ordered the LSE to sell its 60% stake in MTS, a fixed-income trading platform. However, the LSE said the request was \\"disproportionate\\". It warned investors it would struggle to sell MTS and that such a sale would harm its ongoing business. As a result, the LSE said: \\"Based on the commission's current position, LSE believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger.\\" The two rival exchanges announced plans for a \\"merger of equals\\" about a year ago, aiming to create a giant trading powerhouse that would better compete against US rivals. They had already agreed to sell part of LSE's clearing business, LCH, to satisfy competition concerns before the commission's surprise demand concerning MTS earlier this month. The Commission had given the exchanges until Monday to come up with a proposal to meet that demand. LSE said that such a sale would need regulatory approval from several European governments and would hurt its wider Italian business. \\"Taking all relevant factors into account, and acting in the best interests of shareholders, the LSE Board today concluded that it could not commit to the divestment of MTS,\\" the exchange said on Sunday night. When the London Stock Exchange trumpeted its merger with Deutsche Boerse last year, the chairman, Donald Brydon, was remarkably relaxed about the Brexit vote. He and his German counterparts said the deal would go ahead regardless of the outcome. What they didn't know was that it would eventually fall foul of another aspect of the single market - Brussels' control of competition laws. The two sides have made no bones about the fact the merger would create a company with a powerful presence in key markets, and have offered a number of sops to competition authorities in an attempt to win their approval. But it was not enough; Brussels insisted the LSE cede control of MTS, an important Italian clearing house with a crucial role in the trading of Italian government debt. For the LSE board, this was a step too far.  A sale of MTS would be too harmful, the directors decided, and they have chosen not to meet an European deadline to say how they would get rid of it. The Brits say they want to go ahead with the merger, but it looks like an insurmountable obstacle. The LSE will either go it alone in a post-Brexit world, or - as has often seemed possible before, and even more so now - fall into the arms of one of the giant American exchanges. MTS is a relatively small part of LSE's business, but it is a major platform for trading European government bonds, particularly in Italy, where it is classified as a \\"systemically important regulated business\\". The LSE group also owns the Milan-based Borsa Italiana. The LSE said it remained convinced about the merits of a merger, but joining forces with Deutsche Boerse would be impossible unless the commission changed its stance. Deutsche Boerse said on Sunday night that it and the LSE would await a further assessment by the European Commission, which was expected to make a decision by the end of March. Syed Kamall, MEP for London and a member of the European Parliament's financial services committee, told the BBC: \\"I think this is good news for competition, and it's also good news for those who are worried that some business in London might be moved to Frankfurt via the back door.\\" The European Commission declined to comment. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3% on the news.","output":"The proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse is unlikely to be approved, according to the LSE, as the exchange refuses to sell its 60% stake in fixed-income trading platform, MTS, which the European Commission has ordered it to divest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album?  Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...

Answer a question about this article: Eisenhower, as well as the officers and troops under him, had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations, and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans—a beach landing assault. His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Overlord. Admiral Ernest J. King fought with Eisenhower over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific. He also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, as he did. Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed. He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy. What were the French resistance to be used for in advance of the invasion of France?","output":"In advance of the invasion of France, specifically Operation Overlord, the French Resistance forces were to be used for covert and sabotage operations against the Germans. These operations were essential to the success of the Normandy invasion. Eisenhower argued with Roosevelt to reach an agreement with Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French Forces, to coordinate these efforts. The French Resistance consisted of various groups of individuals and organizations who fought against the German occupation of France during World War II. Their role in advance of the invasion of France was crucial, as they helped gather vital intelligence about German defenses, troop movements, and logistics. They also sabotaged German infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and telecommunication systems, which would hinder the German ability to mobilize and efficiently counter the Allied invasion. By conducting these covert actions, the French Resistance aimed to weaken the German forces, disrupt their communication and transportation networks, and create confusion and chaos before the actual landing of the Allied troops in Normandy. This way, their efforts would facilitate the success of the invasion and ultimately contribute to the liberation of France from German occupation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that.

Article:","output":"Title: Master the Art of Parting and Sectioning Your Hair for Flawless Styles Introduction: Perfectly parting and sectioning your hair is an art that not only ensures your hairstyle looks fabulous, but also makes styling your hair significantly easier. Whether you're aiming for a simple side-part or dividing your locks into sections for a more complex updo, being able to effectively part and section your hair is essential. In this article, we will guide you through step-by-step methods to achieve expert-level hair parting and sectioning, along with tips to ensure fantastic results every time. Step 1: Choose the Right Tools For an efficient and precise parting and sectioning experience, invest in a rat-tail comb, which simplifies the process and provides perfectly straight lines. Additionally, consider using hair clips or bobby pins to keep your sections in place while you work. Step 2: Create a Starter Part Before sectioning your hair, you need to create a \\"starter part\\" as a reference point to guide your future sections. To do this, comb your hair carefully to remove any knots or tangles. Then, using the tail-end of your rat-tail comb, create a part by dragging it along your scalp from your forehead to the nape of your neck, dividing your haircut into two equal halves. Step 3: Decide on Your Preferred Part and Section Location Depending on the final hairstyle you are aiming for, decide whether you'd like a center, side or deep side part. Align your part with one of the high points of your eyebrows to find the most flattering location and use the previously created starter part as a foundation. Step 4: Section Your Hair Now that you have determined your desired part location, it's time to start sectioning. Follow these steps to section your hair for styling: 1. Begin by dividing your hair into four main sections. Section off the front two quarters by creating a part that runs from your hairline at the crown down to your ear on both sides. Clip each quarter section to keep them separate. 2. Create another part in the back of your head by dividing the remaining hair down the middle vertically, resulting in two equally sized sections. Clip these sections separately as well. 3. Depending on your chosen hairstyle, further section your hair by dividing the front quarters into smaller sections and securing them with clips or pins. This allows for easier styling and manages your hair. Step 5: Comb and Style Your Sections Now that your hair is properly parted and sectioned, comb and style each individual section as desired. Take care not to mix sections to maintain a neat and organized look. Conclusion: Parting and sectioning your hair may seem like a minor aspect of hairstyling; however, it greatly impacts the final result. With practice and patience, you can become an expert at parting and sectioning, allowing for a seamless and stunning hairstyle every time. By following these simple steps and using the right tools, you'll be on your way to becoming a master of hair parting and sectioning in no time."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most logical next event? How to fly in your dreams  Visualize flight.  Surround yourself with images of flight. Watch films of different kinds of flying: superhero-style flying, birds flying, and people flying with devices.","output":"The most logical next event after surrounding yourself with images of flight is to practice dream control and lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is the ability to become aware that you're dreaming while remaining asleep. When you are aware that you are dreaming, you can then control and manipulate aspects of your dream, such as flying. By taking the steps to learn and practice lucid dreaming, you can unlock the ability to fly in your dreams. Here is a detailed guide on how to achieve lucid dreaming and flying in your dreams: 1. Dream Journaling: Keep a dream journal by your bedside and write down your dreams immediately upon waking up. This will help you remember your dreams and improve dream recall. Recording your dreams also strengthens the connection between your waking and dreaming states, making it easier to become lucid during a dream. 2. Reality Checks: Perform regular reality checks throughout the day to establish a consistent habit. Reality checks help you question your surroundings, making it more likely that you'll recognize the anomalies of a dream state while asleep. Common reality checks include pushing your fingers through your palm or reading text and looking away to see if it changes when you look back.  3. Meditation and Mindfulness: Engaging in regular meditation can help improve your ability to become lucid in your dreams. Meditation practices such as focusing on your breath and observing your thoughts without judgment will enhance your self-awareness and strengthen your connection to your inner self. Practicing mindfulness throughout the day can also help to sharpen your awareness, making it more likely that you will notice when you are dreaming. 4. Sleep Hygiene: Having a proper sleep schedule can make it easier to become lucid in your dreams. Ensure that you are getting enough sleep each night and try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. A well-rested mind is more likely to become lucid during dreams and be able to control the events within them. 5. Wake Back to Bed (WBTB) Technique: The WBTB technique involves waking up after about five or six hours of sleep, staying awake for a short period (15-60 minutes), and then going back to sleep. By interrupting your sleep, you increase the chances of entering a REM sleep period, during which lucid dreams are most likely to occur. 6. Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) Technique: Before going to sleep, repeat a mantra such as, \\"I will become aware that I'm dreaming\\" or \\"I will fly in my dreams tonight.\\" This intention-setting practice helps to create a mental habit that increases the likelihood of becoming lucid during a dream. 7. Visualization: Once you achieve lucidity in a dream, visualize yourself flying. Start by imagining yourself hovering just a few inches above the ground. Gradually increase your height and speed as you gain confidence and control over your dream. You can visualize environments that inspire flight, such as vast open spaces, the sky, or clouds. 8. Experiment with Different Techniques: Understand that each individual is different, and various techniques may be more effective for some than others. Be open to experimentation, and adjust your approach based on your experiences and successes. Remember that practice and patience are key when learning how to fly in your dreams. It may take some time to develop the necessary skills to achieve lucidity and cultivate dream control. Maintaining a persistent and consistent effort in practicing these techniques will eventually enable you to experience the exhilarating sensation of flight within your dreams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is Jamil El Shehab's countryman? , can you please find it?   A beautiful English socialite, Diana Standing, and her wealthy fiancé Gerald Hume arrive at the train station in Cairo, Egypt, where they plan to be married. Although her mother was Egyptian, Diana considers herself part of the British upper class. At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab, a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing women tourists and freeing them from some of their jewelry. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana and soon talks his way into becoming her official guide and driver in Egypt. While touring the Pyramids, Jamil manages to be alone with Diana and romances her with love songs. Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fiancé's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent. Later Jamil uses his position as a servant to enter Diana's hotel bedroom, and kisses her in a moment of passion. Although she briefly returns his kiss, Diana angrily fires him. Soon after, she and Gerald set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide. Undaunted by Diana's rejection, Jamil follows and soon replaces the new guide. That night, Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, who is drawn into his arms again. When she realizes what is happening, she is outraged and strikes Jamil with a whip. On their way back to Cairo, however, Jamil sends the rest of the caravan on one route and tricks Diana into riding to Pasha's oasis retreat, where she is treated like royalty. When Pasha arrives, Jamil lies to him, telling him that Diana paid him to bring her to Pasha. When Pasha forces himself on her, she cries out for Jamil to save her, which he does, and the two ride off together in the night.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How is Lumpus scared of after Lazlo goes missing?  The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

Context: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Let's break down the sentence to analyze its content further: 1. \\"Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England\\": This part of the sentence only informs us about Humphrey Gilbert's fate during his return journey to England and indicates that he did not make it back alive. However, it does not provide information about his second destination or any travels beyond England. 2. \\"was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh\\": This segment of the sentence tells us that after Gilbert's death, his half-brother Walter Raleigh took over his endeavors. Still, it does not offer details about Gilbert's destinations during his travels. 3. \\"who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584\\": This part informs us of Walter Raleigh's patent awarded by Elizabeth in 1584. Again, this statement does not furnish any information about Humphrey Gilbert's second destination. The question regarding Humphrey Gilbert's second destination asks about a specific location that was the focus of his journey following his initial departure from England.

It is claimed that he subjected his wife, Stephanie Lizon, to years of brutal abuse and forced labor. Among the horrifying claims are that Peter violently kicked Stephanie in the stomach, causing her to endure a miscarriage, and forced her to give birth to another child while shackled. The police investigation also adds that Lizon allegedly ran over his wife’s feet with a tractor. According to the reports and evidence gathered, Peter Lizon repeatedly referred to his wife as his \\"slave\\" and demanded that she kneel before him. The authorities were alerted to this grave situation after Stephanie managed to escape from their West Virginia home, confiding in a local shelter worker about the abuse she had suffered. Investigators disclosed during the court hearing the horrifying extent of the abuse, claiming that photographs of the injuries Stephanie Lizon sustained over time demonstrated proof of the sadistic domestic torment she was subjected to. The heartbreaking scenario continued with investigators stating that besides physical abuse, Stephanie was psychologically tormented and demeaned by her husband. The chilling phone records reveal a chilling picture of a woman held captive in her own home, consistently being reminded by Peter of his supposed ownership over her. Given the harrowing nature of the allegations, the case has sparked a nationwide discussion about domestic violence and abuse, highlighting the desperate need for intervention and support for the victims of such heinous acts. The call for a support system that will allow victims to find solace and support while exposing their abusers has never been louder. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the attorney representing Peter Lizon has stated that Stephanie is denying any claims of abuse, and the couple intend to \\"fight the charges together.\\" The defense claims that the evidence provided by the shelter worker is not only unreliable, but also contains a series of inaccuracies. They now aim to question the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses and the overall viability of the case against Lizon. The case is ongoing, with both the prosecution and defense teams fiercely advocating for their respective sides. As the chilling details of Peter Lizon's alleged abuse come to light, the nation is left grappling with the stark reality of the horrifying experiences that some individuals may endure within their own homes. The Lizon case underscores the importance of recognizing the signs of domestic abuse and understanding that no individual should suffer in silence. As new details about Peter Lizon's alleged crimes unfold, it is hoped that the case will prompt increased dialogue around domestic violence and encourage victims to seek help and find a safe space for healing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. Context: On January 3, 2009, Warner led the Cardinals in their victory over the Atlanta Falcons 30-24 at home in the first round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 19 for 32 passing, a completion percentage of 59.4%, for 271 yards. He threw two touchdowns and one interception. This win represented the first time the Cardinals had won a post-season home game since the 1947 NFL Championship Game.  On January 10, Warner helped the Cardinals defeat the Carolina Panthers 33-13 in Charlotte, North Carolina in the second round of the playoffs. During the game Warner went 21 for 32 passing, for 220 yards, a completion percentage of 65.6%, with two touchdowns and one interception. This win was the first time the Cardinals had won a game on the East Coast the entire 2008 season, after having lost away games to the Panthers, Washington Redskins, Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, and the New England Patriots.  On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner is one of three quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two different teams (the others are Craig Morton [1970: Dallas Cowboys and 1977: Denver Broncos] and Peyton Manning [2006 & 2009: Indianapolis Colts and 2013 & 2015: Denver Broncos]). Warner also became the third quarterback in NFL history to win a conference championship with two different teams (following Craig Morton and Earl Morrall).  In Warner's third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1-2 record in Super Bowls. Despite losing, Warner still managed to throw for 377 yards (the fourth-highest total in Super Bowl history). He completed 72.1% of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 112.3. Warner had now recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in the history of the Super Bowl, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three different Super Bowls. Warner had taken his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games. Question: Did they win any other games. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, during Kurt Warner's career with the St. Louis Rams, New York Giants, and Arizona Cardinals, his teams won numerous games in both the regular season and the playoffs. Apart from the playoff games mentioned in the context, Warner enjoyed significant success with the St. Louis Rams. Most notably, he led the team to victory in Super Bowl XXXIV on January 30, 2000, defeating the Tennessee Titans 23-16. In that game, Warner completed 24 of 45 passes for 414 yards and two touchdowns, setting a Super Bowl record for most passing yards in a single game at the time. He also won the Super Bowl MVP award for his performance. During his time with the Rams, which spanned from 1998 to 2003, Warner led the team to two Super Bowl appearances and achieved numerous individual accolades. Together with running back Marshall Faulk, wide receivers Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt, and offensive tackle Orlando Pace, Warner was part of the Rams' offense known as \\"The Greatest Show on Turf,\\" which became one of the most prolific and dynamic offenses in NFL history. In terms of regular-season success, Warner's career includes 103 victories in the games he started as a quarterback. His overall career statistics feature 32,344 passing yards, 208 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 65.5%. To sum up, Kurt Warner led his teams to many victories throughout his career in both the regular season and playoffs, including two conference championships, three Super Bowl appearances, and one Super Bowl victory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A young boy, Mikey, sets newspapers on fire in his basement. He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother admonishes him. His foster mother Grace Kelvin disciplines him and he yells at Beth, taking her doll and throwing it in the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey causes her to fall into the pool and drown. Mikey is secretly taping everything. He goes upstairs and overhears his mother telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey was a bad idea. The phone dies and Mikey walks in. Startled, his mother yells at him to get out. Mikey picks up her blow dryer and turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it and she is instantly electrocuted. Mikey goes downstairs and pours a bunch of marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he rushed out to greet him as if nothing has happened. They sit and chat for a moment when he sees his dead daughter floating lifeless in the pool. In a frantic state he rushes towards the door but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. Mikey proceeds to beat him in the head with a baseball bat. Soon after, the police have arrived to find Mikey \\"hiding\\" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family. A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey get fostered as soon as possible.

Gather the ingredients:    - 1 cup basmati rice (or any long-grain rice)    - 2 cups water    - 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or coconut oil)    - 1 onion, finely chopped    - 2 cloves garlic, minced    - 1 tablespoon ginger, minced or grated    - 1-2 tablespoons curry powder (based on desired spice level)    - 1 teaspoon cumin    - 1 teaspoon turmeric    - 1/2 teaspoon salt    - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper    - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for added spice)    - 1 cup diced vegetables (optional – carrots, peas, bell peppers, etc.)    - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish) 2. Rinse the rice:    - Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and helps to ensure that the rice cooks properly without becoming too sticky. 3. Cook the rice:    - In a medium saucepan, bring the 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for about 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork. Set aside. 4. Prepare the curry sauce:    - In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. 5. Add spices and vegetables:    - Stir in the curry powder, cumin, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Cook for about 1 minute, allowing the spices to toast and become fragrant. Add the diced vegetables (if using) and cook until they begin to soften, about 3-4 minutes. 6. Combine the rice and curry sauce:    - Add the cooked rice to the skillet with the curry sauce and vegetables. Mix everything together until the rice is evenly coated with the sauce and the flavors are well combined. 7. Serve and garnish:    - Taste and adjust salt and pepper, if needed. Transfer the curried rice to a serving dish and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro, if desired. Serve alongside your favorite main dish, such as grilled or roasted chicken, fish, or tofu. By following these steps, you will have a delicious and flavorful dish of curried rice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The farming world Akir is threatened by the tyrannical warlord Sador, who rules the sinister Malmori Empire and, his body parts deteriorating, is capturing and appropriating them from others. Sador's huge dreadnaught (nicknamed \\"Hammerhead\\") mounts a \\"Stellar Converter\\", a weapon that turns planets into small stars. He demands that the peaceful Akira submit to him when he returns in \\"seven risings of your red giant\\", or he'll turn his Stellar Converter on their planet. Zed, last of the famous Akira Corsairs, is old and nearly blind. He suggests they hire mercenaries to protect their world. Since Akir lacks valuable resources, its people can offer just food and shelter in payment. Unable to go in person, Zed offers his ship for the job if they can find a pilot. The ship is fast and well-armed, but, despite its AI navigation/tactical computer Nell, cannot defeat Sador alone. Shad, a young man who has piloted the ship and is well known to Nell, volunteers for the recruiting mission. Seeking weapons, Shad goes to the space station of Doctor Hephaestus (perhaps named after the weaponsmith of the Olympians Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades), an old friend of Zed. The station is populated mostly by androids, except for two humans — Hephaestus, whose numerous life support-systems have turned him into a cyborg; and his beautiful daughter Nanelia, who looks after him and the androids. The doctor wants Shad to mate with his daughter, by force if necessary. Shad can't bring himself to abandon his people; he convinces Nanelia to help him escape. She follows in her own ship; although she has no weapons, her highly advanced computer systems might be useful. The two split up to look for more mercenaries.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

Accused: ex-Dane County sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, pictured, has been charged with killing his wife and the woman's sister. Prosecutors on Friday charged a former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease with shooting his wife and sister-in-law to death earlier this month. The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising 23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Steele, 39, faces two counts of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of his wife, Ashlee Steele, and his sister-in-law, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. He would get two mandatory life sentences if he is convicted. Prosecutors have not offered any motive for the slayings. Steele's attorney, Jessa Nicholson, said during a court hearing Friday that she plans to investigate Steele's mental stability. She appeared with Steele via video conference from the Rock County jail, where Steele is being held because of his close relationship with Dane County jailers. He sat silently in an orange jail jumpsuit and looked directly at the camera as Nicholson spoke. Suspect: Former Dane County Sheriff's Deputy Andy Steele, accused of killing his wife and sister-in-law, makes an initial appearance via teleconference in Dane County Court in Madison, Wisconsin, Friday. Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. 'He wants to work within (the criminal justice) system to see this to its conclusion,' she said. According to a criminal complaint filed Friday, Tollefsbol, 38, called police August 22 from the Steele home in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. She said Steele had shot her and she was dying. Police arrived and found Tollefsbol in the basement, shot in the back and covered with blood, the complaint said. She again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died at a hospital about an hour after making her call for help. A Dane County sheriff's SWAT team discovered Ashlee Steele, 39, dead in the master bedroom. She had been shot in the head and had a zip-tie wrapped around her throat, cutting off circulation, the complaint said. The SWAT team found Andrew Steele in a laundry room with a handgun. The dryer was running but was vented back into the room. A portable grill was also in the room and was very hot and loaded with charcoal. An officer secured the handgun but Steele put up a fight before the team subdued him, the complaint said. Supporters: Andrew Steele's law enforcement colleagues have made videos showing them taking the ice bucket challenge in his honor. No good deed: Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account. Financial success: Mrs Steele and the deputy's friends were able to collect more than 20,000 towards his care through the ALS initiative. Investigators had said previously that Steele suffered injuries consistent with a suicide attempt but didn't offer details beyond saying he wasn't shot. Assistant District Attorney Paul Barnett told reporters Friday that Steele was treated for smoke inhalation at a Milwaukee medical facility. The complaint does not suggest a motive, and Barnett declined to comment on the investigation. Court Commissioner Scott McAndrew set Steele's bail at 1million and ordered him to have no contact with his children or any members of his wife's family. Barnett had asked for 5million, arguing that Steele planned the slayings and would have nothing to lose if he were released and attacked other family members. Barnett also argued that Steele could use money his family raised for his medical bills on bail. Nicholson said the money has been placed in a holding account and will be transferred to a charity. She asked for 100,000 bail and that he be allowed to call the couple's two children, arguing that he doesn't have much time left to spend with them because of his disease. McAndrew said he was not comfortable with anything less than 1million. Steele's wife was spearheading a drive to raise 75,000 for his medical care; her Facebook page is full of videos of Steele's law enforcement colleagues taking ice bucket challenges on his behalf. They had raised about 23,000 when Ashlee Steele died. Steele's preliminary hearing is set for September 4. Steele was ordered held on 1million bail and barred from contacting his family. Fitchburg Police were called to the Steeles' home in the 3000 block of Yarmouth Greenway Drive about 1pm last Friday. According to the affidavit, Tollefsbol called 911 from her sister's home and said her brother-in-law had shot her in the back and she thought he must have shot himself because she heard two shots. Officers found her in the basement, where she again said her brother-in-law had shot her. She died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Members of a sheriff's department SWAT team found Ashlee Steele dead in the home. She had been shot in the head. They found Andrew Steele in a laundry room and a 9 mm pistol on the counter. He had not been shot but had non-life-threatening injuries consistent with a suicide attempt. The affidavit said two rounds had been fired in the house. The Steeles have two children, who have been placed with family members out of state. Tollefsbol and her husband have four children. Dane County Sheriff David Mahoney said Ashlee and Kacee's grandmother died the same day they were killed. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister. Steele was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable neurodegenerative disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, on June 4. His wife had been spearheading a fundraiser called 'Tough As Steele - Taking Down ALS' on the website Give Forward, in a bid to raise money for medical and other expenses. The family said they were struggling financially after Steele became too ill to work in May. The fundraiser for Steele, which appeared to have been removed from Give Forward as of Sunday, described his journey since he was diagnosed. 'Earlier this year, Andy noticed a twitching in his arm muscles that wouldn't stop. Eventually his speech became impaired with slurring and difficulty articulating his words,' the fund-raising website said. It had got so bad, the website said, that the muscle-twitching was never-ending and he couldn't even chew his food. Speaking to NBC15 in Madison earlier this month Steele said: 'I never would have expected the type of reaching out people have done. People that have donated, people that I don't even know very well, I haven't seen or talked to in years. It's hard to describe that.' Family: The couple had two children, and had been together for 26 years. Police have not released a motive. Tragic: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead on Friday, leaving six children behind between them. Young love: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment. Ashlee Steele was listed as the team captain and funds manager on the website, where she was described as 'the love of his life.' The couple had been together for 26 years after meeting as 12-year-olds in Michigan and following each other to the University of Wisconsin in Madison. They married in 1998 and had two children, Jack, and Rachael. Steele had poured buckets of ice on his friends and family following his diagnosis in the now viral 'ice bucket challenge.' According to the sisters' obituaries, Kacee Tollefsbol was studying to be a nurse and held a degree in English from the University of St. Thomas. A mother of four, she had just married Mark Tollefsbol a month before she died. Ashlee Steele, a mother of two, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and taught three-year-olds at a church preschool.

Summarize this article in one sentence. EU officials have been urging Ukraine since 2014 to clamp down on corruption and to carry out other reforms. But critics say not enough has changed, and President Petro Poroshenko has been accused of backing corrupt officials. The Brussels talks with senior EU officials will focus on the progress of reforms, with the promise of visa-free travel for Ukrainians on the table. But Ukraine hopes another matter - Russia's role on Ukrainian territory - will take priority at the meeting. Perception of corruption is worse in Ukraine than in Russia, according to Transparency International. Two weeks ago, the governor of the Odessa region, former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili, resigned, accusing Mr Poroshenko of backing corrupt officials who, he said, were undermining his reform efforts in Odessa. Days earlier, officials were forced to reveal their huge wealth - hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and collections of luxury items - under new anti-corruption rules. In 2014, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power amid corruption allegations - his lavish estate, with Greek ruins and a replica galleon, was then revealed. Last month, activists hung underwear outside parliament in protest - the word for \\"underwear\\" resembles that for \\"cowards\\". Ever-since the collapse of the Soviet Union, corruption has, for many people, continued to be an integral part of everyday life in Ukraine. Ukrainians know that a small payment is often necessary if their child wants to see a good doctor. At some schools extra money can, perhaps benignly, be requested from parents for books or other equipment. A lack of funding for schools and hospitals is part of the problem. Earlier this year a journalist wrote about her shame when she paid a 200 (Â£160) bribe to her university professor, to ensure that he passed her dissertation. Since 2014, some things have changed. The police used to have the worst reputation for exacting bribes. From personal experience, police officers in Kiev nowadays religiously play by the book. Unnecessary levels of bureaucracy are often where \\"extra payments\\" creep in. And low salaries are also to blame. The minimum wage in Ukraine is currently just 56 a month, although it will be doubled in the new year. Ukraine has created a new anti-corruption bureau, a new police force, new electronic systems for tendering government contracts, and a method for tracking the wealth of public officials and politicians. On Wednesday, a 23-year-old lawyer, Anna Kalynchuk, was appointed to lead the anti-corruption drive. Critics claim she lacks the proper experience, but others have welcomed new ideas to challenge older politicians. Days earlier, 24-year-old Anastasia Deyeva was appointed deputy interior minister one of the country's highest-ranking police and security positions. The seizure of territory by pro-Russian rebels in Donbass in south-eastern Ukraine remains a concern for the Kiev government, more than two years after the annexation of Crimea by Russia. \\"I think the focus must be on the situation in Donbass, on Russian aggression, on the extension of sanctions,\\" Ukraine's Foreign Minister  Pavlo Klimkin said before the summit. He said Russia must be forced to honour peace agreements signed in early 2015. Ukraine is also concerned about Donald Trump's praise of the Russian president during the US presidential campaign. Mr Trump repeatedly talked about repairing relations with Russia, and criticised the United States' role in Ukraine. His comments led some Ukrainians to fear a withdrawal of US support, or even the acceptance of the new status quo in Crimea by Mr Trump's White House. Summary:","output":"Ukraine is focusing on fighting corruption with the appointment of a 23-year-old lawyer to lead its anti-corruption drive, as the country faces criticism for not doing enough to tackle the problem and risking the terms of its 17.5bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) lifeline if it doesn't succeed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead, a detailed answer explaining how someone acquires Hepatitis C would be more appropriate. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"How Do You Get Hepatitis C?\\" would be: Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and primarily affects the liver. It is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. The common ways of getting infected with Hepatitis C are: 1. Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment with an infected person. 2. Receiving a blood transfusion, organ transplant, or blood products before 1992 in the United States, when widespread HCV screening was implemented. In some countries without proper blood screening standards, this risk still exists. 3. Accidental needlestick injuries, especially among healthcare workers. 4. Sharing personal care items like razors, toothbrushes, or nail clippers that may have come into contact with an infected person's blood. 5. Unsterile tattoo or body piercing equipment. 6. Mother-to-child transmission during birth, although this happens less frequently. It is important to note that Hepatitis C is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, shaking hands, or sharing eating utensils. In addition, it is not transmitted through airborne particles like coughing or sneezing. Staying informed and taking preventive measures are crucial for reducing the risk of contracting Hepatitis C."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Eric asked Dennis to take care of their cat as","output":"Eric was going away on a business trip for a week. Dennis, being a good friend and a cat lover himself, immediately agreed to help Eric out. Before Eric left for his trip, he provided Dennis with all the necessary details and instructions to ensure the cat's comfort and well-being during his absence. First and foremost, he reminded Dennis that their cat, affectionately named Whiskers, was diabetic and required daily insulin injections.  To further guide Dennis in this important task, Eric showed him the prescribed dosage and how to administer the injections using a special insulin pen. Alongside this, there was a carefully prepared timetable so that the injections would be given at consistent times each day. This would allow Whiskers' body to maintain a stable blood sugar level, ensuring her health did not suffer. Moreover, Eric explained the specifics of Whiskers' diet. He brought out various cans of specialty cat food, specifically designed for diabetic cats, and went into detail about how much and when to feed her. It was essential to keep her diet consistent and avoid giving her any treats not approved by her veterinarian. To help Dennis in this aspect, Eric had organized everything in a practical and efficient manner. He had labeled the food with times and dates to prevent any confusion or deviation from Whiskers' regular feeding habits. Next up was Whiskers' quirky behavior. Eric mentioned that she had a shy personality, quickly becoming nervous in unfamiliar situations. Dennis was advised to approach her calmly and gently so that she could grow accustomed to his presence. Eric also pointed out Whiskers' favorite toys and hiding spots so that Dennis could engage with her constructively, helping her overcome her anxiety and fear. In addition, Eric stressed the necessity of maintaining Whiskers' hygiene. He explained that she had a strict routine of being groomed every second day with a gentle brush and could become distressed if this didn't happen. He handed Dennis a grooming kit, which consisted of a soft brush, a flea comb, and nail clippers for Whiskers' claws. Eric took the time to demonstrate the proper techniques for using these tools, ensuring that Dennis felt comfortable taking care of Whiskers' grooming needs. As the discussion progressed, Eric highlighted that Whiskers had a sensitive stomach, and therefore, it was important to keep her litter box clean. He recommended cleaning it at least twice a day to avoid any unpleasant surprises. In order to avoid triggering Whiskers' sensitivity, Eric had stocked up on litter that was specifically designed for cats with sensitive stomachs. Lastly, Eric provided Dennis with the contact details of Whiskers' veterinarian and instructed him to call immediately in case of any emergency. He left a generous budget for Dennis to use in case any unexpected expenses occurred while he was away. Dennis assured Eric that he would care for Whiskers as if she were his own, adhering to all the detailed instructions and offering her the best possible care during Eric's absence. With a heavy heart, Eric left for his business trip, knowing that Whiskers was in good hands. Meanwhile, Dennis, now equipped with a greater understanding and appreciation of Whiskers' special needs, was eager to provide the loving and attentive care that she required. Over the course of the week, Dennis and Whiskers started to bond, as the shy feline learned to trust her new caretaker. They shared playtime, cuddles, and companionship, ensuring that Whiskers continued to thrive during Eric's absence. When Eric returned, he was relieved to find Whiskers content, healthy, and well-cared for, and offered his deepest gratitude to Dennis for being such a steadfast and attentive friend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to calculate the expected value of sample information (evsi )<br>Calculate the expected monetary value (emv) of each alternative action. Note which is the emv * (greatest value). Determine the likelihood probabilities. Can we draw the following conclusion? The evsi will never equal the emv * pick from the following. i. Yes ii. It's impossible to say iii. No","output":"To address this question, let's think step-by-step through the process of calculating EVSI and EMV*, and then evaluate the statement provided. Step 1: Calculate the EMV of each alternative action. The Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of an alternative action represents an anticipated value for an investment, calculated as the potential benefits of each outcome multiplied by their respective probabilities of occurrence. The highest EMV is denoted as EMV*. Step 2: Determine likelihood probabilities. This involves determining the probabilities of possible outcomes. These probabilities are essential for calculating EMV and EVSI. Step 3: Calculate the Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI). EVSI represents the potential improvement in decision-making provided by the collection of additional information, such as a survey or detailed research. It is the difference between the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and the Expected Opportunity Loss (EOL) without the new information.  Now, let's evaluate the statement: \\"The EVSI will never equal the EMV*.\\" Based on the definitions and calculations of EVSI and EMV*, we can conclude that: iii. No The statement is incorrect because EVSI and EMV* are different concepts. EMV* represents the highest anticipated value for an investment based on current probabilities, while EVSI measures the value of acquiring additional information, which may potentially improve decision-making. It's not accurate to compare these two values directly, as they serve different purposes in the decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let us examine each option and understand why \\"Michigan\\" stands out as the most appropriate response. 1. Michigan: Michigan is a state located in the northern part of the United States. The climate here is characterized by cold and snowy winters. Bees, being cold-blooded insects, slow down and become inactive when the temperature drops. Hence, beekeepers may need to ship their bee colonies to warmer regions during winter to ensure the survival and health of the colony. Michigan, therefore, is a logical answer in this context. 2. United States: United States is a vast country spanning across multiple climate zones, from cold regions in the north to warm regions in the south. The question specifically asks for the original location of the bee before it was shipped down south within the United States. Selecting \\"United States\\" as the answer would be too general and doesn't provide the specific information that the question is asking for. 3. Sky: The sky is not a geographical location where bees typically reside. Bees live in colonies within hives, which are usually found on or near the ground among plant life. The sky, therefore, is not a reasonable answer for the question above. 4. China: China is a separate country in Asia, unrelated to the context of the question. The question implies that the bee had to be shipped to a warm region to avoid cold weather. It's highly unlikely that a bee will be transported from China to the United States due to legal, logistical, and environmental constraints. Thus, choosing China as the answer would not make sense. 5. Apiary: An apiary is a place where bees are kept, usually consisting of multiple beehives and managed by beekeepers. However, the term \\"apiary\\" does not indicate a specific geographical location. Therefore, choosing \\"apiary\\" as the answer does not provide the necessary information to determine where the bee was originally from. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"Michigan\\" as the answer to the question because it is the only option that provides a specific, logical, and relevant geographical location before shipping the bee down south to avoid the cold winter. Michigan's cold and snowy winter climate corresponds with the information provided in the question, and thus, it is the best choice among the given options."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\",  answer the following question.

The app features a clean and well-organized interface that makes navigating through the plethora of rules, feats, spells, and other content a breeze. The search function is quite efficient, handling my queries with precision, and the ability to bookmark favorite pages makes returning to frequently needed rules a cinch. However, there are a few minor issues that keep this app from reaching a solid 5-star rating. Firstly, the app occasionally crashes, causing minor inconveniences during intense gaming sessions. Secondly, while the database is extensive, there are some gaps in the content, particularly when it comes to third-party material. Lastly, the app sometimes consumes more battery life than expected, which can be a concern during longer gaming sessions. Despite these issues, the org.evilsoft.pathfinder.reference app has proven to be a valuable resource for both casual and experienced Pathfinder players alike.

Premise: \\"Yes it is the only way. Then aloud he said abruptly: \\"You are an American?\\"\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, \\"You are an American?\\" very suddenly. \\"?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"Yes it is the only way. Then aloud he said abruptly: 'You are an American?'\\" we can draw certain conclusions and implications about the situation. In order to examine whether it entails the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly,\\" let's analyze the text and context provided. Firstly, the premise provides a dialogue-driven narrative that is descriptive in nature. We understand that a speaker is talking, and they express their thoughts in multiple sentence fragments. The first part of the premise, \\"Yes, it is the only way,\\" implies that the speaker is in agreement with a previously discussed idea or plan. This might signify that the speaker is talking to another person, engaging in a conversation where they are exploring options or trying to reach a consensus on a particular topic. Following this, the second part of the premise states, \\"Then aloud he said abruptly: 'You are an American?'\\" This statement appears to be a direct quote from the speaker, emphasizing the method and tone employed in the dialogue. By describing the speaker as saying it \\"abruptly,\\" we can infer that the question was asked suddenly, with little to no transition from the previous statement. This abruptness likely caught the listener off-guard, perhaps sparking a reaction or an element of surprise. It also suggests that the speaker's curiosity or realization about the nationality of the listener was so pressing that they felt compelled to ask immediately, disregarding conversational norms or social expectations. With the analysis in mind, we can now address how the premise relates to the hypothesis, \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly.\\" The premise provides a direct description of the events occurring within the narrative, explicitly stating that the speaker asked the question \\"abruptly.\\" The term \\"abruptly\\" is synonymous with \\"suddenly,\\" both describing an action or event happening unexpectedly and quickly. As a result, the premise does entail the hypothesis \\"He asked the question, 'You are an American?' very suddenly.\\" The narrative provided in the premise emphasizes the abrupt nature of the question, making it clear that the speaker introduced the inquiry without any prior warning or gradual build-up. This unexpected and sudden execution could potentially serve a variety of purposes within the context of the narrative, such as creating tension, showcasing the speaker's curiosity about the listener's nationality, or emphasizing the importance of the question in relation to the ongoing conversation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: What musical instrument did Jan Thomas play for church services?

As a young adult he is released from prison and works as an organ player at a church. He befriends Anna (Ellen Dorrit Petersen), the priest of the church and a single mother, and her young son Jens. Agnes (Trine Dyrholm), Isak's mother, sees that Jan Thomas has been released and is concerned for the safety of her two adopted daughters. Her panicking reaction causes strain in her relationship with the two girls, as well as with her husband. Meanwhile, her husband accepts a job offer that will move their family to Denmark, in the hopes of easing Agnes' anxiety.

The Swan Diagram, as mentioned earlier, was developed by Australian economist Trevor Swan in 1956 to model the Australian economy during the Great Depression. Although the United States and other international economies had an impact on the Australian economy during that time, the Swan Diagram was specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by Australia. The Swan Diagram is used to illustrate the balance of payments situation of a country, demonstrating the relationship between domestic economic policies and external economic factors, such as global trade and capital flows, as well as exchange rate policies. While the United States and the global economy might have presented challenges or opportunities to the Australian economy during the Great Depression era, it would be inaccurate to attribute the creation of the Swan Diagram primarily to the United States economy. The development of the Swan Diagram was mainly driven by the need to understand the effects of Australia's policy responses to the Great Depression and the essential relationships between domestic and international economic factors. These policy responses were unique to Australia's economic environment and institutional setting, and the Swan Diagram was an important tool in studying the policy interactions between the domestic and external factors. In summary, the creation of the Swan Diagram can be attributed to Trevor Swan's efforts to understand and model the unique challenges faced by the Australian economy during the Great Depression, rather than being primarily due to any direct influence from the United States economy. The framework has since been used to analyze the balance of payments situation of other countries as well, highlighting its versatility and relevance to various economic contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Brooke, a liberal Republican who became the first black in U.S. history to win popular election to the Senate, died Saturday. He was 95.      Brooke died of natural causes at his Coral Gables, Florida, home, said Ralph Neas, a former Brooke aide. Brooke was surrounded by his family.      Brooke was elected to the Senate in 1966, becoming the first black to sit in that branch from any state since Reconstruction and one of nine blacks who have ever served there — including Barack Obama.      Brooke told The Associated Press he was \\"thankful to God\\" that he lived to see Obama's election. And the president was on hand in October 2009 when Brooke was presented with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. Obama hailed Brooke as \\"a man who's spent his life breaking barriers and bridging divides across this country.\\"      A Republican in a largely Democratic state, Brooke was one of Massachusetts' most popular political figures during most of his 12 years in the Senate.      Brooke earned his reputation as a Senate liberal in part by becoming the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Richard Nixon to resign. He told ABC News that Nixon had \\"lost the confidence of the country and I don't know of anything he could do to turn it around.\\"      He helped lead the forces in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and was a defender of school busing to achieve racial integration, a bitterly divisive issue in Boston.      He also lent his name to the Brooke amendment to the federal housing act, passed in 1969, which limited to 25 percent the amount of income a family must pay for rent in public housing.      However, late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention.      Repercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas.      In a Boston Globe interview in 2000, he recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term.      \\"It was just a divorce case. It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime,\\" Brooke said. \\"I would certainly not be truthful if I didn't say I was sorely hurt when the people of Massachusetts voted against me and didn't look beyond the allegations and didn't remember what I had tried to do for them.\\"      In 2008, Barbara Walters said she had an affair with the then-married Brooke in the 1970s, but it ended before he lost the 1978 election. She called him \\"exciting\\" and \\"brilliant.\\"      The first blacks served in the Senate in the 1870s, just after the Civil War, when senators were still selected by state legislatures rather than by popular election. Mississippi's postwar legislators sent two blacks to the Senate. Hiram R. Revels served about 14 months in 1870-71, and Blanche K. Bruce served a full six-year term from 1875 to 81.      Not long before Obama was sworn in as president, Brooke told the AP that he had been frequently asked if he thought Obama could be elected.      \\"And I'd say I'm the last person to say it couldn't happen. I've already shown that white voters are open to voting for black candidates, so it made sense to me,\\" he said.      \\"Though I was pleased, I'm not that surprised that he was able to pull it off. But I am thankful to God to live to see this happen.\\"      When Brooke received the congressional honor in Washington later in the year, he cited the issues facing Congress — health care, the economy and the wars overseas — and called on lawmakers to put their partisan differences aside.      \\"We've got to get together,\\" Brooke said, turning his eyes to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \\"We have no alternative. There's nothing left. It's time for politics to be put aside on the back burner.\\"      As Brooke sought the Senate seat in 1966, profiles in the national media reminded readers that he had won office handily in a state where blacks made up just 2 percent of the population — the state that had also given the nation its only Roman Catholic president, John F. Kennedy.      Brooke had parlayed his probes of local corruption into a successful run for state attorney general in 1962 when he became the highest ranking black elected official in the nation.      Brooke said at the time that his election proved \\"people will elect a man on the basis of his programs.\\" But, he added, \\"I don't presume that the election of one man will solve the racial problem.\\"      He won re-election as attorney general in 1964 even though Democrats dominated other races, commenting later: \\"I won by 797,510 votes. I'll remember that figure as long as I live.\\"      Somewhat aloof from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, especially the militant wing, he said blacks had to win allies, not fight adversaries. But he also said of civil rights leaders: \\"Thank God we have them. But everyone has to do it in the best way he can.\\"      He had refused to endorse Sen. Barry Goldwater for president in 1964, commenting later, \\"You can't say the Negro left the Republican Party; the Negro feels he was evicted from the Republican Party.\\"      \\"I want to be elected on my own ability. Only then do you have progress. ... People should not use race as a basis for labeling me,\\" he told The Washington Post in early 1966.      He beat Democrat Endicott Peabody, a former governor who also supported civil rights, by a 3-to-2 margin despite predictions of a \\"white backlash\\" against him.

Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday described Brooke as ‘‘a model of courage and honesty in office.’’      Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the state’s first black governor, said: ‘‘I have lost a friend and mentor.’’ Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, said Brooke showed ‘‘remarkable political courage.’’      Late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention.

He served in an all-black combat unit in World War II, and later settled in Boston after graduating from Boston University Law School.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen","output":"The given sentence, \\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen,\\" is a complex sentence that might initially appear to be ungrammatical or semantically incorrect. However, upon closer inspection, it can be considered syntactically and semantically acceptable, although it may not be the most conventional way to convey the intended meaning.  First, let's analyze the structure of the sentence. A cleft construction has been used in the sentence to emphasize the information given at the end (i.e., \\"in the kitchen\\"). A cleft sentence is a way of reorganizing information in a sentence to add emphasis on a certain element, typically using a form of the verb \\"to be\\" as the main verb. An alternative way to express the sentence without resorting to a cleft construction would be: \\"Alison and David soaked their feet in the kitchen.\\" Second, with respect to syntactic acceptability, the sentence satisfies the basic grammar rules of English. It has a subject (\\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet\\"), verb (\\"was\\"), and object (\\"in the kitchen\\"). Additionally, the cleft construction is not incorrect in this context; it simply places a stronger focus on the location (\\"in the kitchen\\") by isolating it as the main focus. Regarding semantic acceptability, the meaning of the sentence might not be immediately clear due to the unusual phrasing, but the ideas are still connected logically. The sentence implies that the location where Alison and David engaged in the action (soaking their feet) was the kitchen. It is expressing a rather unusual activity taking place in a typical household setting, but it does not create a paradox or defy logic. Thus, although the sentence \\"Where Alison and David soaked their feet was in the kitchen\\" may be perceived as stylistically awkward or less preferable in terms of phrasing, it is still syntactically and semantically acceptable. It conveys the intended meaning and complies with grammatical rules, but it could potentially be rewritten in a more conventional way to enhance clarity and readability for the reader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland?  Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. A:","output":"People living in inland areas are more at risk of mental retardation due to a lack of iodine in their diet. In coastal areas, people naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil and water contain higher levels of iodine, which is then absorbed by plants and sea creatures such as seaweed and saltwater fish. When people consume these iodine-rich foods, they have a decreased risk of developing iodine deficiency-related health issues, including mental retardation. Conversely, in inland areas, the soil often lacks the necessary iodine content, thus limiting the iodine available in locally grown crops and making it more difficult for the inland population to obtain enough iodine naturally. This lack of iodine in the diet increases the risk of developmental difficulties, thyroid gland problems, and even mental retardation. The introduction of iodized salt greatly improved the availability of iodide in the diet, thus reducing the risk of these health issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider the films' popularity and reception: \\"Back to School\\" is a popular comedy film, and \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" has a cult following. However, this information alone is not enough. We need to examine the critical and audience reception of these works. 3. Research the films' critical and audience reception: A quick search reveals that \\"Back to School\\" has a 6.7/10 rating on IMDb and a 85% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, while \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" has a 6.0/10 rating on IMDb and a 62% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. \\"The Winds of Whoopie\\" doesn't have enough reviews to provide a clear rating on popular review websites. 4. Compare to other directors: To determine if Alan Metter is a great movie director, we may want to compare his work and the reception of his films with other directors considered great. 5. Subjectivity in greatness: It is important to note that the term \\"great\\" is subjective, and people's opinions on what makes a director great may vary. Factors that could influence one's opinion include personal taste in film genres, directing style, impact on the industry, and consistent track record of producing high-quality films.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit. That was nearly 50 years ago and it still pisses me off. Why is the sailor still pissed off today?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Question: The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, why was it asked this? Options: - breathe - experience sadness - forget nothing - remember everything - to get food  The answer is \\"remember everything\\" because Answer:","output":"The answer is \\"remember everything\\" because elephants are known for their exceptional memory and cognitive abilities. This characteristic is often referred to with the expression \\"elephants never forget.\\" The situation presented in the question involves an elephant being asked to recall a previously mentioned number, and the context implies an examination or demonstration of the elephant's memory capabilities. There are a few reasons why an elephant's memory is vital to its survival and success. In the wild, these animals typically live in complex social structures where recognizing, understanding, and remembering relationships among their group members is essential. Additionally, elephants have to remember the locations of scarce resources such as water and food sources during difficult times, like droughts, and pass on this knowledge to their offsprings, aiding the survival of the entire group. Furthermore, elephants are known to grieve their dead and exhibit strong emotions such as sadness and joy, which play an important role in their social bonds. The ability to experience these emotions and remember them helps elephants understand their place in the group and grow socially, emotionally, and cognitively. However, the experience of sadness itself would not necessarily be the reason why an elephant would be asked to recall a number; this would be much more closely linked to showcasing their memory skills. The phrase \\"forget nothing\\" is similar to \\"remember everything\\" but may imply a more passive memory retention, whereas \\"remember everything\\" emphasizes the active cognitive ability to recall specific pieces of information or memories with precision and intent. In the context of the question, the answer \\"remember everything\\" implies that the elephant was asked to remember a number because it is a deliberate demonstration of its mental capabilities. The other options provided, such as \\"breathe\\" and \\"to get food,\\" are not directly related to the elephant's cognitive abilities. Breathing is a basic physiological function that all living creatures perform, and while elephants may use their memories to help them locate food resources, remembering a specific number is not a requirement to achieve this goal. As a result, they do not pertain to the main reason of the elephant being asked to recall the number. In conclusion, the answer is \\"remember everything\\" because the elephant's exceptional memory is being tested and demonstrated by challenging it to remember a specific number previously mentioned. This ability to recall details so accurately is an important quality in elephants that supports their social structure, survival skills, and emotional intelligence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost.

After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed.

Question: Given the background: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.  and the situation: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier.  Answer the following question: If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural? Answer:","output":"Based on Rob's interests and the given background information about valley glaciers and joint blocks, it would be more suitable for Rob to visit the Ural Mountains in Russia next year if he is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers. In the Alps Mountains in Austria, Rob witnessed valley glaciers, which are responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, including large joint blocks. This implies that if he revisits the Alps, he may likely encounter joint blocks within the valley glaciers again, since this is a prevalent glacial phenomenon in such an environment. On the other hand, when Rob went to the Ural Mountains in Russia, he did not see any valley glaciers. This suggests that the glacial environment in the Ural Mountains is not characterized by valley glaciers and, consequently, the presence of joint blocks in the glaciers would be less likely. Therefore, revisiting the Ural Mountains could be a more suitable option for Rob if he wishes to avoid seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers. In summary, if Rob's goal for next year is to avoid seeing joint blocks trapped in glaciers during his travel, he should choose to visit the Ural Mountains in Russia rather than the Alps in Austria, as this region seems to have a lower likelihood of featuring valley glaciers and the associated joint blocks."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Q:What is the full name of the famous artist that decorated the hospital that was opened in 1991?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor.

Manuel Pellegrini must have been looking for Mario Balotelli’s ‘Why Always Me’ T-shirt on Thursday night. Life could hardly get any worse for Manchester City in the Champions League. For the third successive season they were handed a ‘Group of Death’. There’s no sugar-coating it — Group E is gruesome, brutal, grim. If Pellegrini was to pick one scenario he didn’t want ahead of the draw, this wouldn’t have been far off. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City: Vincent Kompany wants the quadruple. Deja vu: Manchester City and Bayern Munich will meet in the group stages for the third time in three years. Possible: James Milner celebrates the third goal when the sides last met, in a 3-2 win for City. His mood will not have been helped by knowing that, down in London, Jose Mourinho had his feet up, with Chelsea surely as good as in the knockout stages after being given a relatively easy ride. For the second successive season, City will face Bayern Munich; the Bundesliga giants wounded by last season’s failed attempt to retain their title. Riding on the crest of Germany’s World Cup win, Pep Guardiola’s side will be one of the toughest teams to beat this season. City’s nightmare does not end there, though. Two clashes against a rejuvenated Roma will provide a huge test of their European credentials. In an uncanny twist, Roma and City crossing paths throws open the possibility of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole going head-to-head for the first time since they left Chelsea this summer. Pellegrini will know the fixtures against Roma and CSKA Moscow are paramount to City making it to the last 16. Quick return: The draw gives Ashley Cole a first chance to return to England when Roma meet City. Tricky tie: Roma are a much better side than in previous years, led by a resurgent Gervinho. And if he thought things could not get much worse, he only needs to look at a daunting eight-day stretch next month when he must squeeze a trip to Bavaria between crucial League clashes at Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. ‘It’s a tough one,’ said City’s sporting director Txiki Beguiristan. ‘Our challenge is to be first in the group because that gives you an advantage. ‘The objective is higher now. That’s why we improved the team, to give us a chance of winning the domestic competitions but also to be better in Europe. There are five, six, eight other clubs that can win it but we can as well. Why should we not set out to win the Champions League?’ Thursday’s draw would also not have made comfortable viewing for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Perhaps not quite to the same extent as Pellegrini, but Wenger will yet again have to pit his wits against one of Europe’s most impressive young coaches in Jurgen Klopp. Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season. Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year. But facing Borussia Dortmund, 2013’s beaten finalists, will not paralyse Wenger’s expensively-assembled squad with fear. After losing to the Bundesliga side on matchday three last season, the Gunners went to Dortmund and recorded a famous 1-0 win against the odds, Aaron Ramsey scoring. Arsenal secretary David Miles said: ‘It’s tough but it’s one from which there’s a pre-requisite to finish first and avoid the likes of Barcelona at the start of the knock-out stage.’ Anderlecht and Galatasaray are likely provide a more modest test. While Liverpool ponder the challenge of Real Madrid, Basle and the Bulgarians of Ludogorets, Mourinho must have had by far the best night’s sleep. Special one: Jose Mourinho will be very please with Chelsea's comfortable Champions League draw. When he holds his weekly press conference at Chelsea’s Cobham HQ on Friday, the Portuguese will inevitably dispel the notion that his side have been handed an easy European ride. But the Special One himself could not have handpicked a more comfortable group. With all due respect, Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Maribor hardly reads as a who’s who of European football’s elite. Much to Brendan Rodgers, Pellegrini and Wenger’s annoyance, no doubt. VIDEO Three European giants drawn in Group F.

The Mayor and Chief of Police","output":"Title: \\"Toymaker's Deception\\" Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot Synopsis: In the quaint and seemingly peaceful town of Whistlewood, everyone looks forward to the annual toy festival celebrated before Christmas. Generations of children have cherished memories of receiving handmade toys gifted by a mysterious and revered toy maker, who always remained out of sight. As excitement fills the town each year, a secret alliance lies between the town's Mayor, Theodore Bannister, and the Chief of Police, Katarina Chambers. The movie begins with the toy festival's preparations in full swing. The protagonist, Emma, a determined investigative journalist from the city, arrives in Whistlewood to write a piece about the festival. As Emma delves deeper, she stumbles upon undisclosed information about the identity of the toy maker and starts unraveling a web of secrets. The town is delightfully decorated, with Whistlewood's citizens rallying together for the much-anticipated toy festival. Emma explores the town, meeting local residents and uncovering stories of gifts given to children by the elusive toy maker. The mayor and the chief of police are seen to be taking a keen interest in the toy festival preparations, ensuring everything remains perfect and smooth. One day, Emma comes across a hidden workshop in the woods. Curiosity piqued, she manages to sneak in and discovers a treasure trove of exquisite, handmade toys. She is caught by an old man, Oscar, who is grumpy but harmless. Oscar reveals that he was once the town's beloved toy maker, but that changed years ago when Mayor Bannister and Chief of Police Chambers hatched a plan to drive him out of Whistlewood to make way for corporate toy manufacturing and to garner funds for their personal benefits. The mayor and chief of police framed Oscar for a crime he didn't commit and made a pact to keep his role as the toymaker a secret, shrouded in mystery. Since then, they've been profiting by selling the toys at exorbitant prices and exploiting the people's belief in the mysterious toy maker. Emma, now fueled by the desire for justice, sets out to expose Mayor Bannister and Chief Chambers' deception. With the unwilling help of Oscar and the support of the townspeople, she devises a plan to unmask the mayor and police chief's hidden agenda. During the grand finale of the toy festival, just as Mayor Bannister and the Chief of Police are basking in the limelight, Emma presents undeniable evidence of what has been happening, exposing them in front of everyone. The townspeople, enraged at the betrayal, demand for Theodore and Katarina's immediate resignation. The movie ends with the town celebrating a joyous, honest toy festival - with Oscar reclaiming his status as the true toy maker of Whistlewood. Emma writes a compelling article on the events that transpired, cementing her belief in the power of truth and justice."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - A grammar school is one of several different types of school in the history of education in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries, originally a school teaching Latin, but more recently an academically-oriented secondary school, differentiated in recent years from less academic Secondary Modern Schools.   - Bromley is a large suburban town, the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London, England, United Kingdom. It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead.  - A school is an institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or \\"pupils\\") under the direction of teachers.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Urban sprawl or suburban sprawl describes the expansion of human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional and usually car-dependent communities, in a process called suburbanization. In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In Continental Europe the term \\"peri-urbanisation\\" is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.  - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority.

Title: How to Make a Monster Movie plot: When a test group says the company's latest video game, Evilution, is too boring, the game's development team is fired. Businessman Peter Drummond hires three new programmers: A weapons expert named Hardcore, a game artificial intelligence designer named Sol, and a sound effects creator named Bug. Faye Clayton promises 1 million to the programmer who makes the game the \\"scariest\\", igniting a fierce rivalry between the trio. During a storm three weeks later, lightning strikes the building and causes all of the computers and electronic equipment to go offline. After a meeting with Drummond, the three programmers decide to try out the game with the help of Clayton Software intern Laura Wheeler. The game involves a motion capture suit that is connected to the computer network and used to program the game's movements. Peter places a backup CD into the external drive while the others set up. Bug, Hardcore, and Sol soon lose the game, and are surprised to see Laura get all the way to the final boss. Sol inserts his new AI chip into the mainframe and begins to play the game. As he advances to the game's third level, the motion capture suit connected to the computer network comes alive. Simultaneously, the suit attacks Sol in real life while an in-game monster drags Sol's video game character away. The following morning, Bug and Hardcore discover that Sol has been killed and the backup CD has been stolen. Hardcore attempts to review the security camera tapes with his PDA, but accidentally touches the motion capture suit, which has merged itself with Sol's dead body. The suit attacks Hardcore; although he initially manages to fight it off, he is later killed. The suit then merges itself with Hardcore's muscular body and takes all of his weapons, giving it a striking resemblance to the monster in the game. Bug theorizes that the lighting strike combined with Sol's powerful AI chip has caused the suit to believe the real world is part of the video game. Bug, Laura and Drummond decide to pull the computer's plug,... Answer:","output":"Can't answer."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

You are given a new situation: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power. Both companies strive to be more efficient and to pollute less.  and a hint : A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  Please answer this question : Which company made less fuel for cars? A:","output":"Based on the given information, Company A is a refinery that manages petroleum products, which include fuel for cars. On the other hand, Company H produces and distributes electricity using wind power. Therefore, Company H made less fuel for cars as it is not involved in the production or distribution of petroleum products, focusing instead on renewable energy from wind power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What league will be bringing an expansion team in 2021 to the city that once housed the Seattle Supersonics?, using the article: Seattle was awarded a Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Pilots, in 1969. The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001. The NBA All-Star Game was also held in Seattle twice: the first in 1974 at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in 1987 at the Kingdome.Seattle also boasts two collegiate sports teams based at the University of Washington and Seattle University, both competing in NCAA Division I for various sports. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the Huskies, competes in the Pac-12 Conference, and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the Redhawks, mostly competes in the Western Athletic Conference. The Huskies teams use several facilities, including the 70,000-seat Husky Stadium for football and the Hec Edmundson Pavilion for basketball and..., what would be the answer ?

Und noch schlimmer ist, dass sich diese Realität zudem auf die Verzerrung des Autonomieanspruchs der Arbeit gründete, wie ihn die radikale Linke in Italien in den siebziger Jahren artikulierte. Translate this to English?","output":"Moreover, what makes it even worse is that this reality was also based on the distortion of the claim to autonomy of labor, as articulated by the radical left in Italy during the 1970s. In this statement, the author seems to be critiquing a particular aspect of socio-political and economic development. The author references the radical left in Italy from the 1970s as a key driver or contributor to this issue. Specifically, they highlight the distortion of the \\"claim to autonomy of labor,\\" implying that this distortion has led to negative consequences in society. To provide a broader context on this issue, let's delve into the political and social climate of Italy in the 1970s. During this period, Italy experienced a turbulent time marked by economic struggles, political tensions, and social unrest. The radical left, an array of socialist and communist factions, strongly believed in the empowerment of the working class. Among their beliefs was the need for greater autonomy in labor in order to challenge the power structures that dominated society at the time. It can be understood that the author sees the distortion of this \\"claim to autonomy\\" as being problematic, perhaps because the original intent might have become lost or misrepresented over time. It's possible that the shift from genuinely seeking to empower workers to a more general sense of entitlement or individualism may have been perceived as a problematic change. Moreover, this distortion may have contributed to various societal issues that the author is criticizing. In conclusion, this statement critiques the historical distortion of the radical left's claim to autonomy of labor in Italy during the 1970s. The author suggests that this distortion has led to negative socio-political and economic consequences, making it even worse for the society at large. Understanding the political and social context of the time can help in grasping the deeper concerns brought forth by the author."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. John Stevens. They are supposed to be a man’s best friend. But it seems a new generation of dogs are not so well behaved. A third of dog owners have being bitten or attacked by a dog, it has been revealed. The rise of the unruly dogs has been blamed on a lack of discipline when they were puppies when their owners could not be bothered to have them trained properly. Snarl: A third of dog owners have been bitten, according to new research. File picture. The leading veterinary charity the PDSA has warned that millions of dogs are more aggressive due to gaps in their pet knowledge. A study of pet owners by the charity found that around 5.3million dogs (some 61 per cent) never attended training classes within the first six months of life. It said 1.3 million dogs across the UK are now displaying behavioural problems. The 2012 PDSA Animal Welfare Report found that a fifth of dog owners in the East of England reported that their dogs show problem behaviour on a regular basis. This was closely followed by the North East (19 per cent) and Yorkshire and Humber (19 per cent). Undisciplined: A lack of or poor training is behind the alarming figure, according to the PDSA. File picture. The area of the UK with the least reported problem behaviour in dogs was Wales (8 per cent). The research revealed that almost one in three (30 per cent) dog owners have been bitten or attacked by a dog with over half (51 per cent) knowing someone else who has. While in some cases dogs are deliberately trained to be aggressive, the report found that the primary cause of the anti-social behaviour is a lack of socialisation and basic obedience training when dogs are young .David Ryan, Clinical Animal Behaviourist and former Chair of the Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors said: ‘Good puppy socialisation and training classes undoubtedly help to reduce the initial development of aggression, but it is also essential to provide our pets with guidance in good behaviour, at home and elsewhere, throughout their lives. 'Training should be synonymous with ‘living with’ and never stops.’ PDSA Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Sean Wensley, said: ‘Each year there are awful stories of dogs attacking pets and people, sometimes with fatal consequences. ‘Tackling this begins with owners and breeders taking full responsibility for their dogs’ behaviour and adequately socialising and training them from a young age. ‘It is also essential that young people understand how to be safe around all pets and learn how to become caring and responsible owners in the future. ‘In PDSA’s view, this should include learning about a pet’s five welfare needs at school as well as from other responsible adults around them.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article says that many dogs are behaving badly and attacking people. This is happening because many dog owners did not properly train their dogs when they were puppies. A study found that around 61% of dogs never went to training classes when they were young.

Do you know who Edward Snowden is? He is a man who used to work for the United States government, at a place called the National Security Agency (NSA). He shared some secret information about what the government was doing, and now he lives in a country called Russia because he's afraid of what might happen to him if he goes back home. Guess what? Edward Snowden just talked to some people from a TV channel in Germany, which is another country in Europe. He told them that some people from the US government have said that they want to hurt him. He even thinks that they might want to shoot him or make him sick with poison! But do not worry too much, because he's being very careful. Right now, he's hiding in Russia, and he's not planning to go back to the United States anytime soon. One reason he doesn't want to go back is because he doesn't think he will get a fair trial in court.  You see, there's a law called the Espionage Act, which makes it very hard for people like Edward Snowden to defend themselves in court. He believes that this law doesn't let him tell the judge and jury why he did what he did, which is important for them to understand his side of the story.

Questions: When can a person's death not be wanted by the person? Options: - cyanide - love - burial - suicide - murder The answer to this question is:","output":"murder.  A person's death not being wanted by the person typically refers to a situation where the individual has not made the decision or does not have control over the circumstances leading to their death. In the options provided, murder best aligns with this concept. Murder, by definition, is the unlawful killing of another person without consent, justification, or legitimate reason. It is an act where the victim has no control over their fate, and it is generally committed with malicious intent by another individual. Therefore, murder is the option that most clearly demonstrates a situation where a person's death is unwanted by the person themselves. To further explain, let us examine the other options: 1. Cyanide: Cyanide is a highly toxic substance that can be lethal when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. While cyanide poisoning could potentially play a role in some unwanted deaths, it is just a poison and not a situation or action that directly relates to the individual's desires or intent. 2. Love: Love is an abstract concept and an emotion that can elicit strong feelings of affection, connection, and commitment between individuals. It is not directly related to causing death or any violent act in most cases, and it does not fit the context of the question. 3. Burial: Burial is a common practice for disposing of a deceased person's body, often in the form of internment underground or placement in a tomb. It is a process that takes place after a person has died and does not pertain to whether the death itself was wanted or unwanted by the person. 4. Suicide: Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life. While it is a tragic and devastating event, it is a decision ultimately made by the individual and typically arises from a state of deep mental anguish, despair, or hopelessness. In this context, the person chooses to end their own life, and their death is not forced upon them by someone else, unlike in the case of murder. Thus, suicide does not fit the criteria of a person's death being unwanted by the person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Classroom A classroom is the most suitable place where one would need to use a writing instrument, as it is designed to facilitate learning, teaching, and communication. Writing instruments, such as pens, pencils, and markers, are essential tools for students and educators in a classroom setting. They are used for various tasks, such as taking notes, completing assignments, drawing diagrams, and solving problems. In a classroom, writing instruments are indispensable for various reasons: 1. Note-taking: Students need to take notes during lectures and discussions in order to retain vital information. Writing instruments allow them to quickly and efficiently record details they will later need for studying and revision. 2. Homework and assignments: Students are often required to complete written tasks, such as essays, reports, and worksheets. Writing instruments are necessary for these activities, as they allow students to produce legible, organized, and well-presented work. 3. Examinations: Many exams require students to write down their answers using a pen or pencil. It is essential for students to be able to use writing instruments confidently and effectively so that they can express their thoughts accurately and concisely. 4. Collaboration and group work: In many classroom activities, students work together in teams to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and share knowledge. Writing instruments play a crucial role in these interactions. They allow students to record each other's input, create visual representations, and jot down key points for later reference. 5. Presentations and visual aids: Instructors and students often use visual aids to support their presentations, discussions, or explanations. Writing instruments are required to create these visual materials, such as diagrams, charts, and illustrations. 6. Learning new concepts: The process of learning often involves practicing and applying new ideas through written exercises. In this context, writing instruments help students to better understand and internalize complex information. In conclusion, a classroom is the most suitable setting to use writing instruments, such as pens, pencils, and markers. They facilitate effective communication, foster critical thinking, and enhance overall academic performance. By contrast, options A (pocket), B (purse), D (writer's hand), and E (stationary) do not represent settings or situations in which the actual use of writing instruments is required or essential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas... The answer is:","output":"In the context of the Shoshone National Forest and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the non-native plant species that are considered noxious include: 1. Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) 2. Musk thistle (Carduus nutans) 3. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) 4. Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) 5. Yellow toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) These non-native plants are considered noxious because they negatively impact native plant communities and the species that depend on them. They can outcompete native plants for resources, reduce biodiversity, and alter ecosystems, causing lasting damage to the environment. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle also have a significant negative impact on some tree species, as they affect the health of timberland in the forest."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Context: Tracy found Kendall's place even after Kendall said he didn't want to be bothered.

Step-by-step justification: 1. \\"Because of the small production lots\\" is translated to \\"Aufgrund der kleinen Produktionsmengen\\". \\"Because of\\" is translated to \\"Aufgrund\\", and the object \\"small production lots\\" remains the same in structure, \\"kleinen Produktionsmengen\\". The adjective \\"small\\" is translated to \\"kleinen\\" and it describes \\"Produktionsmengen\\", which is a compound noun formed by \\"Produktion\\" (production) and \\"Mengen\\" (lots).   2. \\"Many of these models\\" is translated to \\"viele dieser Modelle\\". \\"Many\\" is translated to \\"viele\\", and the phrase \\"of these models\\" is translated to \\"dieser Modelle\\". 3. \\"Sell out right after release\\" is translated to \\"sind direkt nach der Veröffentlichung ausverkauft\\". \\"Sell out\\" is translated to \\"ausverkauft\\", and \\"right after\\" is translated to \\"direkt nach\\".

The waitress, Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson), tells him that the murderers were Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle), a shapeshifting Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad (Johnny Knoxville). Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MIB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories of the aliensâand of him. J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent Kâwho was neuralyzed when he retired, and remembers nothing of his MIB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the town's postmaster, J explains this, and convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MIB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed; fortunately, Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub) has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement.

It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that...  - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss.  - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel.  - Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation.

Critics are mostly pleased; the film currently has a 74% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Andrew O'Hehir has high praise for it. \\"It's a bracing tonic for the bored palate of the mainstream moviegoer, and one of the most intriguing big-budget breakthrough films since Steven Spielberg made Jaws,\\" he writes for Salon, adding that it has \\"tremendous visual daring, magnificent special-effects work, and surprising moral gravity.\\" Betsy Sharkey at the Los Angeles Times isn't quite as big a fan.

Delving into the sensitive side of the monstrous creature, Edwards manages to captivate the audience by balancing the building-smashing mayhem with an intriguing storyline. Critics have generally been pleased with the film, which holds a 74% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Andrew O'Hehir of Salon applauds the movie, referring to it as \\"a bracing tonic for the bored palate of the mainstream moviegoer,\\" while comparing it to Spielberg's Jaws in terms of its big-budget breakthrough. Edwards' \\"tremendous visual daring, magnificent special-effects work, and surprising moral gravity\\" form a strong foundation for the film. However, Betsy Sharkey from the Los Angeles Times believes that Edwards allows \\"too many people problems and ... other monsters\\" to detract from the true star of the show – the gigantic Godzilla itself.  Edwards' primary objective in this latest installment seems to be a return to the creature's serious, dramatic roots. Ian Buckwalter from NPR suggests that Edwards succeeds in striking a balance between \\"character and meaningful story\\" and the sheer spectacle of the movie. Buckwalter adds, \\"This is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to: never short on dazzle, but unafraid to let us catch our breath once it's been taken away.\\" Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune goes so far as to argue that the new Godzilla film is \\"the best Godzilla since the first Godzilla,\\" although he admits that this praise is not overly enthusiastic. He lauds the movie's technical achievements, but notes that it often \\"mumbles and repeats itself\\" while lacking a strong focus on human details.

Britain played an important part in developing the first generation of computers. The parents of Tim Berners-Lee both worked on one of the earliest commercial   computers and talked about their work at home. As a child he would build models of computers from packing material. After graduating from Oxford University he went on to the real thing. In the 1980s, scientists were already communicating using a primitive version of e-mail. While working at a laboratory in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program, which let him store these messages. This gave him another idea: write a program that will let academics  from across the world share information on a single place. In 1990 he wrote the HTTP and HTML programs which form the basis of the World Wide Web. The next year his programs were placed on to the Internet. Everyone was welcome to use them and improve them if they could. Programmers used this codes  to work with different operating systems. New things like web browsers  and search engines were developed. Between 1991 and 1994 the number of web pages rose from 10 to 100,000. In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee formed the newly formed World Wide Web consortium , or W3C. More than 200 leading companies and laboratories are represented by W3C.

Choices:  - sweating - having fun - smiling - increased heart rate - anger  The rationale to choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"sweating. Sweating is an uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope because it is a physical activity that requires exertion and energy. As you jump rope, your body works harder to keep up with the demand for oxygen and to maintain your muscles' function. This leads to an increase in your body temperature, and sweating is your body's way of cooling itself down. Let's briefly go over the other choices to clarify why they are not valid answers: - Having fun: Although some might find exercise fun, it is not an \\"uncomfortable\\" consequence. Jumping rope can be enjoyable, and engaging in an activity you enjoy can improve your overall mood. - Smiling: Smiling is generally associated with feeling happy, not being uncomfortable. Jumping rope can cause some people to smile due to the enjoyable nature of the exercise or the release of endorphins, which might bring about feelings of happiness and accomplishment. - Increased heart rate: While it is true that an increased heart rate is a consequence of jumping rope as it is a cardiovascular exercise, it is not inherently \\"uncomfortable.\\" A higher heart rate during exercise is normal, as it allows your body to increase blood circulation and deliver oxygen to your muscles efficiently. - Anger: Jumping rope is unlikely to cause anger, as this emotion is not a direct result of the physical activity itself. It is possible that external factors might lead to anger, but this is not a consequence specific to jumping rope. In conclusion, among the given choices, \\"sweating\\" is the most uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope because it is a natural but potentially bothersome response to the physical demands of the exercise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person Branca was the attorney for? is inside the article: Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, \\"Star of records, radio,..., can you guess it ?

After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \\"donkey punch\\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man. Marcus, Bluey, Kim and Lisa go to the master bedrooms where they begin having drug-fuelled sex, watched by Josh who, in the knowledge of all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness, recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a penknife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender.

Article: Wear comfortable and supportive shoes for daily activities, proper sports footwear for activities and exercise, and avoid heels over 1.5 inches (four cm) for daily use. Proper footwear is especially important during exercise because the wrong shoe can lead to injuries and sprains. Avoid wearing flip flops too often in the warmer months, as they don’t provide any support and can cause foot pain. The instruments used for manicures and pedicures can harbor and spread bacteria if they aren’t sterilized properly. Instead, practice proper foot hygiene on a daily basis and treat yourself to a weekly or semimonthly self-pedicure.  If you do go for a pedicure, bring your own tools whenever possible. Never share pedicure instruments with others, especially emery boards. They are porous and cannot be sterilized properly, meaning they can trap and spread bacterial and fungi. Because diabetes can restrict circulation, it can cause health problems with the extremities, especially the hands and feet. Diabetes can cause neuropathy, or nerve damage, making it harder to detect injuries on your feet. The disease can also prevent your body from healing as quickly as it should, which increases the risk of infection.  Diabetics should examine their feet every day for injuries like blisters, calluses, scaly skin patches, cracking skin, and cuts and wounds. Treat wounds immediately, and make sure your doctor looks at your feet at every visit. There are several bacterial, viral, and fungal problems that can adversely affect the health and appearance of your feet, including athlete’s foot, warts, and nail fungus.  When using public swimming pools or showers (such as at hotels or gyms), wear water shoes or flip flops to protect your feet from possibly contaminated water. Symptoms of athlete’s foot include burning, itching, redness, and peeling.  Warts are rough, grainy growths on the skin that may have black pinpoints scattered throughout. Nail fungus, which can enter the toenail through a crack or break, can cause nails to become brittle, thick, and discolored. Chronic foot pain is never normal, and should always be addressed with a medical practitioner. It can be a sign of plantar fasciitis, a stabbing pain and inflammation down the bottom center of the foot, which needs to be treated with therapy, orthotics, or possibly surgery. Aging, extreme cold, and joint pain can also cause foot pain, but if you frequently experience pain in your feet, talk to your doctor. There are many common medical problems that can cause foot pain and irritation, or make you embarrassed about the look of your feet. Sometimes there is nothing you can do about these conditions, but many can be treated with a little attention, orthotics, or perhaps medical attention. Some of the most common conditions involving the feet include:  A bunion, which is a protruding bone that sticks out from the side of your foot where the big toe meets the foot. Bunions can cause pain, but unless the pain is severe, shoe inserts and cushions are usually favored over surgery. Hammertoes, which occur when the toes begin to bend downward at the middle joint because of out-of-balance muscles. This condition can be treated with proper footwear, foot supports, or possibly surgery. Having flat feet, when the entire sole of your foot makes contact with the ground. It is treated with strengthening exercises, arch supporting inserts, or orthotics. Calluses and corns, which are patches of thick, hard skin caused by constant pressure and rubbing. They can be trimmed or removed medically, treated with medicated pads and patches, or softened with soaking and gentle scrubbing with pumice. Gout, which is characterized by swelling, stiffness, pain, and redness of the joints in the feet, especially the big toe, as well as the ankles and knees. Gout is a form of arthritis and is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

It accepts deposits only from top Catholic Church officials and entities, Settimio Caridi testified in U.S. District Court in 2006. It uses its funds \\"for designated pious purposes\\" and is \\"an autonomous pious foundation,\\" he said. Caridi, a top Italian legal scholar who was called to testify by Vatican lawyers, said the bank is an integral part of the Vatican, a \\"central entity under the oversight of the Holy See.\\" It is ultimately overseen by a commission of five cardinals -- the top position in the Vatican hierarchy below the pope -- which is headed by the Vatican secretary of state. The Vatican Bank is subject to particularly stringent anti-money-laundering regulations because Italian law does not consider it to be operating within the European Union. It must supply more detailed information about transactions than European Union banks have to give. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome and Richard Allen Greene in London, England, contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"So, imagine there is a big bank called the Vatican Bank, and it is like a special piggy bank for important people in the Catholic Church. The bank is in a special place called the Vatican, which is like a little country inside another country called Italy. Some people who work for the bank might have not followed the rules properly, so the Bank of Italy, which is like a big boss for banks in Italy, stopped the Vatican Bank from using some money for a while. They could do this because the Vatican Bank was trying to do these things on Italian soil, which is like the ground where Italy is in charge. The Vatican Bank is supposed to help with nice and helpful things, and some important people in the Church watch over the bank to make sure it follows the rules. But, sometimes, people can make mistakes or not follow the rules, and that's when officials in Italy step in to make sure everything is alright."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eisenhower's GI Bill. This piece of legislation paved the way for white GIs to attend college. Despite their veteran status returning black servicemen were not afforded loans at the same rate as whites. Furthermore, at the time of its introduction, segregation was still the law of the land barring blacks from the best institutions. Overall, \\"Nearly 8 million servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the GI Bill after World War II. But for blacks, higher educational opportunities were so few that the promise of the GI Bill went largely unfulfilled.\\" Question: What opportunities were few for black veterans?","output":"The opportunities that were few for black veterans following World War II were largely tied to higher education and home loans. The reason these opportunities were limited was due to systemic racial discrimination, segregation, and racial inequalities prevalent in the United States during the mid-20th century. Despite the GI Bill – formally known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 – aimed at supporting veterans by providing them with benefits such as educational opportunities and home loans, black veterans were not able to fully benefit from this bill. One of the main factors limiting access for black veterans was the strict segregation policies in place at the time; they barred black individuals from attending elite educational institutions which were predominantly attended by whites. The GI Bill, while having nominally equal provisions for all veterans, ended up having a disparate impact due to the racial realities of the time. Higher educational opportunities, a key element of the GI Bill, were intended to provide veterans with the chance to enrol in college, thereby transforming their lives and careers. However, for black veterans, these opportunities were few. They were systematically excluded from many higher education institutions due to segregation, which significantly limited their access to quality education. The opportunities that were available did not compare in quality or prestige to the ones that were offered to their white counterparts. In addition to barriers in education, black veterans also faced discriminatory practices in securing home loans. The GI Bill promised low-interest, zero down-payment home loans for veterans. However, lending institutions, alongside federal housing policies, systematically denied black veterans these loans or offered them under unfavorable conditions, leading to the low rate of homeownership among black populations when compared to whites. Thus, while the GI Bill opened doors for white veterans and significantly contributed to the expansion of the American middle class, for black veterans, the promise of the GI Bill for higher education and housing opportunities went largely unfulfilled. This further exacerbated the educational and socioeconomic gap between black and white Americans, having negative consequences that can be traced to modern disparities experienced by African-American communities in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus.  Which student learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds?  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Ken learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds.

Problem:Paragraph: Backgrounds Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus epidemic has emerged in Wuhan city, China and then rapidly spread to other areas. As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (≤10 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), septal/subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (≥ 24 kg/m 2 ) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge.

Nathan, who had looked upon the men under Colonel Allen much as he had Corporal 'Lige, was literally amazed by this ready submission of the king's troops, standing silent and motionless by the side of Isaac as the garrison was paraded without arms, and the surrender made in due form.  Some days afterward Isaac learned that the spoils of war at this place were one hundred and twenty iron cannon, fifty swivels, two ten-inch mortars, one howitzer, one cohorn, ten tons musket-balls, three cartloads flints, thirty gun-carriages, a quantity of shells, a large amount of material for boat building, one hundred stand of small arms, ten casks of powder, two brass cannon, thirty barrels of flour and eighteen barrels of pork.  Forty-eight soldiers were surrendered and preparations were at once begun to send these, together with the women and children, to Hartford.  Hardly was the surrender made complete when such of the troops as had been left on the opposite shore under Seth Warner, arrived in a schooner, much to the surprise of all, until it was learned that Captain Herrick, who had been sent to Skenesborough to seize the son of the governor, had succeeded in his mission without bloodshed.  He took not only the young major, but twelve negroes and attendants, seized the schooner owned by the elder Skene, and had come down the lake in the early morning with the hope of aiding in the capture of Ticonderoga.  Isaac had supposed this victory would end the adventure, and was saying to himself that his experience had been rather pleasing than otherwise, so much so in fact that he almost regretted the time was near at hand for him to return home, when he saw, much to his surprise, a portion of the troops being formed in line as if to leave Ticonderoga.

Lady Gaga and the Sociology of the Fame is to be taught by Professor Mathieu Deflem, a fan of the singer. The course, which has its own blog, is due to start in spring 2011. The Belgian born sociologist, whose research interests also include counter-terrorism, international policing, crime control and internet technology, says he has seen Lady Gaga in concert 30 times. \\"We're going to look at Lady Gaga as a social event,\\" Prof Deflem told the USC student newspaper, the Daily Gamecock. \\"So it's not the person, and it's not the music.

Premise: Most expensive are silk or silk blend items. Hypothesis: The pure silk items are more expensive than the silk blend items. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Step 1: Identify the components of the premise and hypothesis. - In the premise, we have \\"most expensive\\" and \\"silk or silk blend items.\\" - In the hypothesis, we have \\"pure silk items\\" and \\"more expensive than silk blend items.\\" Step 2: Determine if there is a direct correlation between the components. - The premise states that silk and silk blend items are generally the most expensive. - The hypothesis is comparing the cost of pure silk items to silk blend items. Step 3: Assess if the premise supports the hypothesis. - The premise provides information on silk and silk blend items being most expensive but does not specifically compare the two against each other. - The hypothesis directly compares pure silk items to silk blend items in terms of cost. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it doesn't provide enough comparative information between pure silk and silk blend items directly. The premise only states that both these types of items are generally the most expensive, without making a direct comparison between the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What counties was the CEW in? from the following article ?  The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a segregated community; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive. The answer is:","output":"The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was located in East Tennessee and spanned across two counties: Roane County and Anderson County. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, while the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The town of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff and was situated close to the CEW facilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Math Problem Solve 2*g - 4 - 2 = 0 for g.","output":"To solve the equation 2g - 4 - 2 = 0 for the variable g, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the like terms. In this equation, the like terms are the constants -4 and -2. 2g - 4 - 2 = 0 2g - 6 = 0 Now our simplified equation is 2g - 6 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable Next, we need to isolate the variable g. To do this, we will move the constant term to the other side of the equation by adding 6 to both sides. 2g - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 2g = 6 Step 3: Solve for the variable Finally, we need to solve for g by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. (2g) / 2 = 6 / 2 g = 3 So, the value of g that satisfies the equation 2g - 4 - 2 = 0 is g = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Head of CIA resigns over affair Hall of Fame beckons for Capriati On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"I would rate the resemblance between the first sentence, \\"Head of CIA resigns over affair,\\" and the second sentence, \\"Hall of Fame beckons for Capriati,\\" as a 1 on the 0-to-5 scale. The reason for this assessment is that while both sentences have minimal meaning overlap, they are related in the context of sharing news about prominent figures experiencing significant events in their respective fields. In the first sentence, the subject is the resignation of the Head of the CIA due to an affair. This story revolves around a high-ranking government official whose actions led to a personal scandal, resulting in the official stepping down from their position. The key aspects of this sentence involve the CIA, an affair, and a resignation. The second sentence, \\"Hall of Fame beckons for Capriati,\\" is focused on the tennis player Jennifer Capriati and her potential induction into the Hall of Fame. This is also news about a notable figure, but in the context of sports rather than government service. In this sentence, the main aspects involve a sportsperson, achievement, and recognition through the Hall of Fame. Therefore, while the two sentences do not mean the same thing and exhibit very minimal meaning overlap, they share the commonality of reporting news about well-known figures experiencing significant events in their respective areas of expertise. As a result, they merit a rating of 1 on the 0-to-5 scale."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes.

How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Letter B Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine   if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you. If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after.
