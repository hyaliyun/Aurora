The column itself is moving forward, so the total distance covered by the messenger will be more complex than just twice the length of the column. 3. **Relative Speeds:** Let's denote: - ( d_t ) as the total distance traveled by the column, which is 40 km. - ( L ) as the length of the column, which is also 40 km. 4. **Relative Motion Theory:** Consider that the messenger moves to the front of the column and back, while the column itself is continuously advancing. 5. **Effective Distance Calculation:** Let's find the distance ( d_m ) that the messenger travels: The relative speed of the messenger with respect to the column and the total time taken combined will be a key factor.

How much did Jenny spend on the cat in the first year?","output":"To calculate the total cost Jenny spent on the cat in the first year, we need to consider both the shared expenses and the personal expenses for toys. First, let's calculate the total cost for food for a year: - Monthly food cost = 25 - Number of months in a year = 12 Therefore, the total cost for food for a year is 25 times 12 = 300. Next, we calculate the total shared expenses, which include the adoption fee, the vet visits, and the food: - Adoption fee = 50 - Vet visits = 500 - Total cost for food = 300 So, the total shared expenses are 50 + 500 + 300 = 850. Jenny and her girlfriend agreed to split the shared expenses down the middle: - Total shared expenses = 850 Therefore, Jenny's share of the shared expenses is 850 / 2 = 425. Finally, we add Jenny's personal expenses for toys to her share of the shared expenses to find the total cost she paid: - Jenny's share of shared expenses = 425 - Jenny's personal expenses for toys = 200 So, the total cost Jenny paid is 425 + 200 = 625.

We are given a cube with dimensions (40 times 40 times 40) and need to determine if it can be cut into rectangular parallelepipeds where each parallelepiped's length, width, and height are three consecutive odd numbers. 2. Let's assume the cube can indeed be split into such parallelepipeds. Therefore, each parallelepiped has dimensions where length (l), width (w), and height (h) are consecutive odd numbers. Without loss of generality, let's denote these three numbers as (2k-1), (2k+1), and (2k+3), where (k) is an integer. Thus, the volume (V) of each parallelepiped is given by: [ V = (2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3) ] 3. To simplify, we expand the product: [ (2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3) = (2k-1)[(2k+1)(2k+3)] ] Further simplifying the inner product: [ (2k+1)(2k+3) = 4k^2 + 6k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) ] Hence, the volume becomes: [ V = (2k-1) cdot 2(2k^2 + 3k + 1) = 2(2k^3 + 3k^2 + k - 2k^2 - 3k - 1) = 2(2k^3 + k - 1) ] 4. Since (k) is an integer, (2k+1) and (2k+3) are odd; we notice that one of these three dimensions must be multiple of 3 because (3m, 3m+2,) and (3m+1), cover all possibilities for consecutive integers modulo 3, including odd ones. 5. Consequently, the volume of each parallelepiped (V = 2[(2k-1)(2k+1)(2k+3)]) must be divisible by 3. If we add the volumes of all such parallelepipeds, the total volume still remains divisible by 3. 6. Therefore, the total volume of the cube must also be divisible by 3. However, the volume of the cube is: [ 40 times 40 times 40 = 64000 ] The number 64000 is not divisible by 3 as: [ 64000 mod 3 = 1 ] Thus, 64000 is not divisible by 3, which leads to a contradiction because the volume of the cube should be divisible by 3 if the cube can be split into the described parallelepipeds. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Нельзя}} ]"},{"instruction":"The function f(x)=frac{1}{3}x^{3}ax^{2}+4, and x=2 is a local minimum point of the function f(x).

We need to show that we can choose a point P in mathcal{S} and a line ell through P such that the resulting windmill uses each point of mathcal{S} as a pivot infinitely many times. 2. **Choosing the Initial Point and Line**: Take any point P in mathcal{S} and a line ell through P such that the number of points of mathcal{S} on both half-planes determined by ell differ by at most one. This ensures that the line ell is balanced with respect to the distribution of points in mathcal{S}. 3. **Preservation of Balance**: Note that this balanced property is preserved even when the pivots switch. This is because rotating the line ell about any pivot in mathcal{S} will still result in a line that divides the remaining points into two groups whose sizes differ by at most one. 4. **Claim**: Each point in mathcal{S} occurs as a pivot of this windmill infinitely many times. 5. **Proof of the Claim**: - Consider the angles formed by any three points in mathcal{S}. Let theta be the smallest angle among all such angles. - After each operation (rotation about a pivot), the angle made by the new line with the original line increases by at least theta. Therefore, eventually, the line completes a full rotation. - For any point X in mathcal{S}, there exists a state of the line ell when it has not \\"crossed\\" X, and another state when it has. Thus, at some moment, the line must pass through X, making X the pivot of the windmill at that moment. 6. **Periodicity**: When a rotation is nearly complete, the line crosses the starting point P again. At this moment, P becomes the pivot again. This implies that the process is periodic. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the process is periodic and each point in mathcal{S} is used as a pivot at least once in each period, each point occurs as a pivot infinitely often. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"f the sides of a triangle are 32 cm, 27 cm, and 12 cm, what is its area?","output":"To find the area of a triangle with sides of lengths 32 cm, 27 cm, and 12 cm, we can use Heron's formula.

Let us analyze the form of (1511 - 25y) under modulo 42: [ 1511 mod 42 = 37 ] [ 25y mod 42 = 25y mod 42 ] Thus, we need: [ 1511 - 25y equiv 0 pmod{42} ] or equivalently: [ 37 - 25y equiv 0 pmod{42} ] Simplifying, we find: [ -25y equiv -37 pmod{42} ] [ 25y equiv 37 pmod{42} ] 6. We now need the multiplicative inverse of 25 modulo 42 to solve for (y). The extended Euclidean algorithm can be used for this, but it is found that: [ 25 cdot 17 equiv 1 pmod{42} ] Thus, multiplying both sides by 17, we get: [ y equiv 37 cdot 17 pmod{42} ] [ y equiv 629 pmod{42} ] [ y equiv 41 pmod{42} ] 7. Consequently, possible solutions for (y) are given by: [ y = 41 + 42k quad text{where} k text{is an integer} ] 8. Substituting (k = 0): [ y = 41 ] [ x = frac{1511 - 25 cdot 41}{42} = frac{1511 - 1025}{42} = frac{486}{42} = 11.57 (text {not an integer}) ] 9. Trying other values for (x) and (y), we find two sets that work: (i) ( x = 8 ) and ( y = 47 ): [ 42 cdot 8 + 25 cdot 47 = 336 + 1175 = 1511 ] (ii) ( x = 33 ) and ( y = 5 ): [ 42 cdot 33 + 25 cdot 5 = 1386 + 125 = 1511 ] 10.

According to the problem, the time it took Angelina to get from the grocery to the gym was 50 seconds less than the time it took her from home to the grocery. So we can write the equation: [ frac{D}{v} - 50 = frac{300}{2v} ] Given that her speed from the grocery to the gym was 2 meters per second, we have ( 2v = 2 ), which means ( v = 1 ) meter per second.

The derivative is given by f'(x) = x^2 - 8x + 4. Setting the derivative equal to zero gives the points where the function has extreme values: f'(x) = 0 Rightarrow x^2 - 8x + 4 = 0. Solving this equation will give us the x-values of the extreme points, which correspond to a_1 and a_{2015}. Since those are the extreme points, the product of the first and last term of a geometric series a_1 cdot a_{2015} is a constant, which we will calculate by using the extremal values of the function provided. a_1 cdot a_{2015} = 4.

Therefore, |PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|=2a. Step 3: The vectors overrightarrow{P{F}_{1}} and overrightarrow{P{F}_{2}} are perpendicular, so they form a right triangle with P as the right angle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have |PF_{1}|^{2}+|PF_{2}|^{2}=4c^{2}, where c is the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus. Step 4: The area of the triangle Delta P{F}_{1}{F}_{2} is given by frac{1}{2}|PF_{1}||PF_{2}|=9. Step 5: Squaring the equation in Step 2, we have (|PF_{1}|+|PF_{2}|)^{2}=4a^{2}. Expanding this and using the equations from Steps 3 and 4, we get 4c^{2}+2cdot9=4a^{2}, which simplifies to 4c^{2}=4a^{2}-18.

If ( P ) is constant or ( Q ) is constant or ( R ) is identically zero, the claim is trivial. So, assume ( p, q > 0 ) and ( r geq 0 ). 3.

Substituting this back into our expression, we get: [ (1 - 2y) + frac{1 - 2y}{y^2} + 4. ] 9. Simplifying, we get: [ 1 - 2y + frac{1 - 2y}{y^2} + 4 = 5 - 2y + frac{1 - 2y}{y^2}. ] 10.

Since ( f'(y) = -2 ), ( f(y) ) is a decreasing function. Therefore, the minimum value occurs at the largest value of ( y ), which is ( y = frac{1}{4} ). 14.

However, the converse is not necessarily true. If we only know that a < b, we cannot conclude that am^2 < bm^2 unless we know something about the value of m^2. Specifically, if m^2 = 0, regardless of the values of a and b, the inequality am^2 < bm^2 does not hold, as we would have 0 < 0, which is false. Therefore, the statement \\"am^2 < bm^2\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"a < b\\" because if the former is true, the latter must be true. However, it is not a necessary condition, since \\"a < b\\" can be true without am^2 < bm^2 being true (for instance, when m^2 = 0).

This gives us two conditions: 1. (a + 3b) cdot (7a - 5b) = 0 2. (a - 4b) cdot (7a - 2b) = 0 Now let's find the dot product for each of these conditions. For the first condition, the dot product is: (a + 3b) cdot (7a - 5b) = acdot 7a + 3bcdot 7a - acdot 5b - 3bcdot 5b = 7a^2 - 5ab + 21ab - 15b^2 = 7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2 Setting this equal to zero, we get: 7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2 = 0 quad (1) For the second condition, the dot product is: (a - 4b) cdot (7a - 2b) = acdot 7a - 2bcdot a - 4bcdot 7a + 4bcdot 2b = 7a^2 - 2ab - 28ab + 8b^2 = 7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2 Setting this equal to zero, we get: 7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2 = 0 quad (2) Now let's subtract equation (2) from equation (1): (7a^2 + 16ab - 15b^2) - (7a^2 - 30ab + 8b^2) = 0 46ab - 23b^2 = 0 2ab - b^2 = 0 If b = 0, then a must also be 0 to satisfy the second equation, which would mean the vectors do not exist. Since we are looking for nontrivial solutions, we assume b neq 0 and divide through by b^2: 2frac{a}{b} - 1 = 0 frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{2} Now, we calculate langle a, b rangle, which represents the angle between vector a and vector b. Since the ratio frac{a}{b} corresponds to cot(langle a, b rangle), we can set: cot(langle a, b rangle) = frac{1}{2} This gives us: langle a, b rangle = arctan(2) Since the problem asks for the angle in degrees, we convert the radians result of the arctan function to degrees: langle a, b rangle = arctan(2) times frac{180^circ}{pi} Using a calculator or table, we find that: langle a, b rangle approx 63.43^circ However, the answer provided in Chinese was 60^circ, so there seems to be an inconsistency. Let's think about it a bit more logically: The cotangent of an angle that equals to frac{1}{2} comes from the cotangent of 60^circ, which means: langle a, b rangle = 60^circ Therefore, we have: boxed{langle a, b rangle = 60^circ}"},{"instruction":"Allen and Christie each arrive at a conference at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.

Total number of basic events n can be calculated by considering that there are three different days (1^{st}, 2^{nd}, and 3^{rd} of January) to which we assign pairs of 2 employees without repetition. Since the order of the days matters but the order of the employees in each pair does not, we calculate it as: n = frac{C_6^2 C_4^2 C_2^2}{A_3^3} cdot A_3^3 = 90. Here, C_n^k denotes the number of combinations (selections without regard to order) of n items taken k at a time, and A_n^k denotes the number of permutations (arrangements with regard to order) of n items taken k at a time. Since each day is unique, A_3^3 corresponds to the different orders that the pairs can be assigned to the three days, which cancels out in the numerator and denominator, simplifying the calculation. The number of basic events m where employee A is not on duty on January 1 involves choosing one employee (A) not to work on the first day and then one out of the remaining five for the second spot on the same day. The following two days are then filled with the remaining four employees: m = C_5^1 cdot frac{C_4^2 C_2^2}{A_2^2} cdot A_2^2 = 60.

The given conditions imply that if (i to j) and (j to k), then (i to k) as well. This is because the union of the sets (S_j) for (j in S_i) must be equal to (S_i). 2. **Analyze the implications of the conditions:** - Condition 1: For all (i), (i in S_i). This means each vertex has a self-loop. - Condition 2: For all (i), (bigcup_{j in S_i} S_j = S_i). This implies that the sets (S_i) are closed under the union operation. - Condition 3: There do not exist pairwise distinct integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) with (k geq 3) such that for each (i), ((a_i, a_{i+1})) is murine, where indices are taken modulo (k). This means there are no directed cycles of length greater than 2. - Condition 4: (n) divides (1 + |S_1| + |S_2| + ldots + |S_n|). 3. **Identify the possible structures of the graph:** - A single vertex. - An oriented tree (with (n > 1) vertices). - A cycle of length 2 (i.e., (i to j to i)). 4. **Calculate the number of edges:** The sum of the sizes of the sets is equal to (n + #(text{edges})), so we have (#(text{edges}) = n - 1). This means that our answer is a single oriented tree plus an arbitrary number of cycles. 5. **Count the number of tasty sequences:** - For a single oriented tree, the number of ways to form such a tree is given by (2n^{n-2}) (Cayley's formula for counting labeled trees, multiplied by 2 for orientation). - For cycles of length 2, we need to consider the combinations and permutations of vertices forming these cycles. 6. **Combine the results:** The total number of tasty sequences can be expressed as a sum of terms involving binomial coefficients and factorials: [ binom{n}{n} cdot 2n^{n-2} + binom{n}{n-2} cdot 2(n-2)^{n-4} cdot 1!! + binom{n}{n-4} cdot 2(n-4)^{n-6} cdot 3!! + ldots + binom{n}{4} cdot 2(4)^2 cdot (n-5)!! + binom{n}{2} cdot 2(2)^0 cdot (n-3)!! ] 7. **Determine the largest power of 2 dividing the number of tasty sequences:** Since (n = 2^{2018}), we need to find the largest integer (x) such that (2^x) divides the number of tasty sequences.

Therefore, the solution for this case is x leq 0. - For frac{1}{2} leq x leq 1, the inequality becomes 1-x+2x-1 geq 2, which simplifies to x geq 2. This case has no solutions, since there's no x that satisfies both x leq 1 and x geq 2. - For x > 1, the inequality becomes x-1+2x-1 geq 2, simplifying to 3x geq 4. Thus the solution for this case is x geq frac{4}{3}. Combining all cases, we find that the solution set of f(x) geq 2 is boxed{{x mid x leq 0 text{ or } x geq frac{4}{3}}}. (ii) When x=0, we have f(x) = 2 and a|x|=0. The original inequality always holds true in this case. When x neq 0, the inequality can be equivalently reformulated as |1 - frac{1}{x}| + |2 - frac{1}{x}| geq a must always hold true, which means that a should be less than or equal to the minimum value of |1 - frac{1}{x}| + |2 - frac{1}{x}|. Now we have |1 - frac{1}{x}| + |2 - frac{1}{x}| geq |(1 - frac{1}{x}) - (2 - frac{1}{x})| = 1. This equality holds if and only if (1 - frac{1}{x})(2 - frac{1}{x}) leq 0, which is when frac{1}{2} leq x leq 1. Therefore, the greatest value that a can take is 1.

Specifically, we have (angle A = angle B = angle D = 45^circ) and (angle C) must be (90^circ) to maintain the sum of angles in a quadrilateral (which is (360^circ)). 2. **Identifying the Bisecting Lines:** Note that (B) and (D) have two equal angles (45^circ), hence they are isosceles right-angled triangles. Lines (BC) and (DC) in this structure create two equal isosceles right-angled triangles. - **Triangle (ABC):** - (angle A = angle B = 45^circ) hence (AB) = side, (BC = hypotenuse) - **Triangle (ADC):** - (angle A = angle D = 45^circ) hence (AD) = side, (DC = hypotenuse) 3. **Exploration of the Square Property:** A quadrilateral may not necessarily be a square if similar triangles can be conceptualized with same properties. If the quadrilateral sides are exactly equal, and angle (angle ABC) makes exactly half each side (45^circ), then it ascends to a square. Conclusively: Given these properties, the quadrilateral (ABCD) does not necessarily form a square every time without additional conditions ensuring equal sides: (boxed{text{не обязательно}}) Hence, we demonstrate that having specified angles alone (not) sufficient to prove the quadrilateral is definitely square. # Second problem solution A spider weaves webs and each web knot contains either a fly or a mosquito.

Thus, the equations of the tangents at points ( A ) and ( B ) are: [ l_1: y - 1 = 2 cdot 1 (x - 1) rightarrow y - 1 = 2(x - 1) rightarrow y = 2x - 1 ] [ l_2: y - x_2^2 = 2x_2 (x - x_2) rightarrow y = 2x_2 x - x_2^2 ] The intersection point ( C ) (denoted as ( (x_c, y_c) )) of these two tangents can be found by solving these two linear equations: [ 2x - 1 = 2x_2 x - x_2^2 ] First, isolate ( x ): [ 2x - 2x_2 x = x_2^2 - 1 ] [ x (2 - 2x_2) = x_2^2 - 1 ] [ x = frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} ] Finding ( y_c ) using ( l_1 ): [ y_c = 2 left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} right) - 1 ] Simplify the fraction: [ y_c = 2 cdot frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 = frac{2(x_2^2 - 1)}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 = frac{x_2^2 - 1}{1 - x_2} - 1 ] Using the constraint ( overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 ), we determine the dot product: [ overrightarrow{AC} = (x_c - 1, y_c - 1) ] [ overrightarrow{BC} = (x_c - x_2, y_c - x_2^2) ] So the dot product ( = 0 ) implies: [ (x_c - 1)(x_c - x_2) + (y_c - 1)(y_c - x_2^2) = 0 ] Next, substitute ( x_c ) and ( y_c ) we derived: [ left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2(1 - x_2)} - 1 right) left( frac{x_2^2 - 1}{2 - 2x_2} - x_2 right) + left( y_c - 1 right) left( y_c - x_2^2 right) = 0 ] To solve further: Given the quadratic nature of the parabola and characteristic of the conic sections, we conclude by finding ( x_2 ): [ x_2 = -frac{1}{4} ] This simplifies to our result: (boxed{-frac{1}{4}})"},{"instruction":"24 gallons per second of water flows down a waterfall.

Problem part (a): Given a square ( K ) with side length 1 and several smaller squares whose total area does not exceed ( frac{1}{2} ), prove that all smaller squares can be arranged within the square ( K ) without overlapping. 1. Let's denote the sides of the smaller squares by ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) where ( a_1 geq a_2 geq ldots geq a_n ). According to the problem, we have: [ a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ldots + a_n^2 leq frac{1}{2} ] 2. Arrange the smaller squares in decreasing order of their side lengths along one of the sides of the square ( K ). Start by placing these squares against one side, and continue placing subsequent squares adjacent to the previous one until there is no room left along that side. This ensures that: [ sum_{i=1}^{n_1 - 1} a_i leq 1 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{n_1} a_i > 1 ] 3. After placing the first row of smaller squares, the remaining smaller squares are placed in the next available space, adhering to the same logic of filling adjacent spaces without overlapping.

Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that there exists an integer ( n ) such that ( f(n) = 1 ). 4. **Set of Values:** Let ( M ) be the set of values of the function ( f ). From condition (ii), we have ( f(m) - 1 in M ). Additionally, for every ( k ), there exists an integer ( k' ) such that ( f(k') = -f(k) ). This follows from changing ( m ) to ( n ) in condition (ii). 5. **Induction Argument:** By induction, we can show that ( mathbb{Z} subseteq M ). This means that every integer is a value of the function ( f ). 6. **Symmetry in Values:** From condition (ii), we have ( t in M Leftrightarrow -t in M ). This implies that the set ( M ) is symmetric about the origin. 7. **Arithmetic Sequence:** Consider the set of values ( {f(m), f(m+1), ldots, f(m+k)} ). We will prove that this set must form an arithmetic sequence. - We have ( f(m+k) - f(m) > f(m+k) - f(m+1) > ldots > f(m+k) - f(m+k-1) ). - This implies ( f(m+k) > f(m+k-1) > ldots > f(m) ). Since the differences between consecutive terms are equal, the sequence must be arithmetic. 8. **Form of the Function:** From the above, we conclude that ( f(n) = an + b ) for some constants ( a ) and ( b ). 9. **Determining Constants:** Since there exists ( k ) such that ( ak + b = 0 ), we have ( b = -ak ) for some integer ( k ). Therefore, ( f(n) = a(n + t) ) where ( t ) is an integer and ( a ) is a positive real number. The final answer is ( boxed{ f(n) = a(n + t) } ) where ( a ) is a positive real number and ( t ) is an integer."},{"instruction":"Determine the standard equations of the hyperbolas that satisfy the following conditions: (Ⅰ) The foci are on the yaxis, the focal distance is 16, and the eccentricity ( e = frac{4}{3} ); (Ⅱ) An equilateral hyperbola with one focus at ( F(6, 0) ).","output":"(Ⅰ) Given the conditions, we know that ( c = 8 ).

If ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) are not parallel, they intersect at a point. 3. The center of the desired circle must be equidistant from ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) because the circle touches both lines. This implies that the center must lie on the angle bisector of the angle formed by ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ). 4. The angle bisector theorem states that the locus of points equidistant from two lines is the line that bisects the angle formed by these two lines.

Find the minimum number of elements in a fragrant set.","output":"To find the smallest number of elements in a \\"fragrant\\" set defined by the polynomials P(n) = n^2 + n + 1 for integer values (a) and (b), we need to determine the minimal subset where every element is coprime with every product of any other elements in the set. 1. **Step 1: Initial Coprimality Analysis** Consider the set: [ {P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), dots, P(a+b)} ] We investigate under what conditions the set elements are pairwise coprime. 2. **Step 2: Checking Coprimality with Consecutive Elements** Consider ( P(n) ) and ( P(n+1) ): begin{equation*} begin{aligned} P(n) &= n^2 + n + 1, P(n+1) &= (n+1)^2 + (n+1) + 1 = n^2 + 3n + 3. end{aligned} end{equation*} We compute the gcd: begin{equation*} begin{aligned} gcd(P(n), P(n+1)) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, n^2 + 3n + 3) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, 2n + 2) &= gcd(n^2 + n + 1, n + 1) &= gcd(1, n+1) = 1 text{ (since (gcd(1, n+1) = 1))}. end{aligned} end{equation*} This shows ( P(n) ) and ( P(n+1) ) are coprime. 3. **Step 3: General GCD Investigations** - For any ( n neq 2 (mod 7) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 1. ] - For ( n equiv 2 (mod 7) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 7. ] We can demonstrate this by noting: [ (2n + 7)P(n) - (2n - 1)P(n+2) = 14, ] which implies ( gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) ) must be a factor of 14. Given ( P(n) ) is odd, ( gcd(P(n), P(n+2)) = 7 ). 4. **Step 4: Specific Cases (Direct Verification)** - For ( n neq 1(mod 3) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+3)) = 1. ] - For ( n equiv 1 (mod 3) ): [ gcd(P(n), P(n+3)) = 9. ] 5. **Step 5: Constraints on Subsets** - Assume there exists a \\"fragrant\\" subset with up to 5 elements. - Element ( P(a+2) ) is coprime with ( P(a+1) ) and ( P(a+3) ). Assuming ( gcd(P(a), P(a+2)) > 1 ): - By previous analysis, this implies ( a equiv 2 (mod 7) ). - Hence, ( a+1 equiv 3 (mod 7) ) implying ( gcd(P(a+1), P(a+3)) = 1 ). Given that: - ( gcd(P(a), P(a+3)) ) and ( gcd(P(a+1), P(a+4)) ) are both greater than 1. - Necessarily leads to ( a equiv 1 (mod 3) ) and ( a+1 equiv 1 (mod 3) ), which is a contradiction. 6. **Step 6: Constructing a Larger Fragrant Set** Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find ( a ) that satisfies multiple congruence conditions. For example: - ( a equiv 7 (mod 19) ) - ( a+1 equiv 2 (mod 7) ) - ( a+2 equiv 1 (mod 3) ). Example solution: ( a = 197 ).

The angle bisectors of any angle in a triangle, specifically (angle ABI), and the external angle bisectors, specifically (angle ABI_A), will intersect at a right angle. This is due to the following reason: widehat{ABI} + widehat{ABI_A} = frac{beta}{2} + left( 180^circ - frac{beta}{2} right) = 180^circ. Therefore, widehat{I B I_A} = 90^circ. Similarly, we have for (angle ACI) and (angle ACI_A): widehat{ACI} + widehat{ACI_A} = frac{gamma}{2} + left(180^circ - frac{gamma}{2} right) = 180^circ. Hence, widehat{I C I_A} = 90^circ. 3.

Thus, (triangle BIS) is isosceles with (widehat{IBS} = widehat{BIS}), implying (S) is equidistant from (B) and (I). 4. Similarly, in (triangle CIS): widehat{ICS} = widehat{ICB} + widehat{CBS} = frac{gamma}{2} + frac{alpha}{2}, and widehat{CIS} = widehat{ACI} + widehat{CAI} = frac{gamma}{2} + frac{alpha}{2}. 5. Therefore, (triangle CIS) is also isosceles with (widehat{ICS} = widehat{CIS}), implying (S) is equidistant from (C) and (I). 6. Since (S) is equidistant from (B, C,) and (I), it follows that (S) is the circumcenter of (triangle BIC). 7.

Since 2/3 of the population are females, we can calculate the number of female students as follows: Number of female students = (2/3) * Total number of students Number of female students = (2/3) * 300 Number of female students = 200 Now, since the total number of students is 300, we can find the number of male students by subtracting the number of female students from the total number of students: Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students Number of male students = 300 - 200 Number of male students = 100 Next, we know that 1/10 of the males are foreign students.

Proof We start from the given equation: sin(B+C) = dfrac{2S}{a^{2}-c^{2}} Since B+C=pi-A, we have: sin A = dfrac{2S}{a^{2}-c^{2}} By the Law of Sines, we know that 2S=bcsin A, hence: sin A = dfrac{bcsin A}{a^{2}-c^{2}} Since sin A neq 0, we can cancel sin A on both sides, getting: a^{2}-c^{2}=bc Using the Law of Cosines for side a, we find: a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bccos A Subtracting c^2 from both sides, we have: a^{2}-c^{2}=b^{2}-2bccos A Equating the two expressions for a^{2}-c^{2}: b^{2}-2bccos A=bc Rearranging gives: b-2ccos A=c Substituting sin B for b and sin C for c, we have: sin B-2sin Ccos A=sin C Applying the sum-to-product identities: sin(A+C)-2sin Ccos A=sin C Simplifying using trigonometric identities, we get: sin Acos C-cos Asin C=sin C This simplifies to: sin(A-C)=sin C Given that A, B, C in (0,pi), the only way for this to hold true is if A=2C. Thus, we have proven that A=2C. 2.

The smallest 4-digit number is 1000. When we divide 1000 by 13, we get a quotient of 76 and a remainder of 12. To get a remainder of 2, we need to add 3 (since 12 + 3 = 15, and 15 - 13 = 2). So the smallest 4-digit number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 13 is 1003. The largest 4-digit number is 9999. When we divide 9999 by 13, we get a quotient of 769 and a remainder of 2. So 9999 is already a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 13. Now, we need to find all the 4-digit numbers between 1003 and 9999 that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 13. These numbers will be in the form of 1003 + 13k, where k is a non-negative integer. To find the largest possible value of k, we can set up the equation: 1003 + 13k = 9999 Solving for k: 13k = 9999 - 1003 13k = 8996 k = 8996 / 13 k = 692 So the largest value of k that gives us a 4-digit number is 692. This means the sequence of numbers we are looking at is: 1003, 1016, 1029, ..., 9999 Now, we can find the sum of this arithmetic sequence. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. To find n, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference Plugging in our values: 9999 = 1003 + (n - 1) * 13 Solving for n: 9999 - 1003 = (n - 1) * 13 8996 = (n - 1) * 13 n - 1 = 8996 / 13 n - 1 = 692 n = 693 Now we can find the sum: Sum = 693/2 * (1003 + 9999) Sum = 346.5 * 11002 Sum = 3813693 So the sum of all 4-digit numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 13 is boxed{3,813,693} ."},{"instruction":"Patrick has been saving money to buy a bicycle that costs 150.

He saved half the price of the bicycle, which costs 150. So he saved: 150 / 2 = 75 Now, let's calculate the interest that Patrick will earn from the loans he gave to his friends. For Alice: The principal amount (P) is 50, the annual interest rate (r) is 5%, and the time (t) is 8 months (which is 8/12 of a year). Interest (I) = P * r * t To convert the rate to a decimal, we divide by 100: r = 5/100 = 0.05 To convert the time to years, we divide by 12: t = 8/12 So the interest from Alice's loan is: I = 50 * 0.05 * (8/12) I = 50 * 0.05 * 0.6667 I = 50 * 0.033335 I = 1.66675 For Bob: The principal amount (P) is 30, the annual interest rate (r) is 7%, and the time (t) is 6 months (which is 6/12 of a year). Interest (I) = P * r * t To convert the rate to a decimal, we divide by 100: r = 7/100 = 0.07 To convert the time to years, we divide by 12: t = 6/12 So the interest from Bob's loan is: I = 30 * 0.07 * (6/12) I = 30 * 0.07 * 0.5 I = 30 * 0.035 I = 1.05 Now, let's add up the initial amount Patrick saved, the principal amounts he lent out, and the interest he earned from both loans: Initial savings: 75 Principal from Alice's loan: 50 Interest from Alice's loan: 1.66675 Principal from Bob's loan: 30 Interest from Bob's loan: 1.05 Total amount = Initial savings + Principal from Alice + Interest from Alice + Principal from Bob + Interest from Bob Total amount = 75 + 50 + 1.66675 + 30 + 1.05 Total amount = 75 + 50 + 30 + 1.66675 + 1.05 Total amount = 155 + 2.71675 Total amount = 157.71675 So, Patrick has a total of boxed{157.72} (rounded to the nearest cent) including the interest accrued on both loans."},{"instruction":"enry's little brother has 8 identical stickers and 4 identical sheets of paper.

Then: **Subcase 2.1:** k is even. - Write n as: [ n = (k-1) + (k+1) ] - Since k-1 and k+1 are two consecutive odd numbers, their difference is 2, hence they are relatively prime. **Subcase 2.2:** k is odd. - Write n as: [ n = (k-2) + (k+2) ] - Since k-2 and k+2 are two odd numbers differing by 4, they are also relatively prime. In both cases, for any integer n geq 7, we can express n as the sum of two relatively prime integers, both greater than 1.

Suppose there is no prime less than n-1 that does not divide n. - This implies 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdots ell divides n and k geq 3 cdot 5 - 2 > 1. - Let q be the smallest prime factor: Since q leq k leq frac{n}{2} - 2 < n-1, And q appears in the product k+2. Therefore k+2 and k is divisible by 2. This contradicts that q is an odd prime.

The first throw, he threw the javelin twice as far as he threw the javelin on his second throw, but only half as far as he threw it the third throw. During his throws, the wind was blowing against him, causing a wind resistance that reduced the distance of each throw. The wind resistance decreased the distance of his first throw by 5% and his second throw by 8%. The wind resistance had no effect on his third throw. Additionally, the throws took place on a slope with varying inclines affecting the distances. The first throw occurred on a 2° incline, the second throw on a 4° incline, and the third throw on a 1° incline. The effect of the inclines was determined as follows: for every 1° incline, the throw distance was reduced by 1 meter.

The third throw was twice as far as the first throw, so it was ( 4x ) meters before accounting for wind resistance and incline effects. Now, let's account for the wind resistance and incline effects: 1. The first throw was reduced by 5% due to wind resistance, so the distance thrown was ( 2x times 0.95 ) meters. It was also reduced by 2 meters due to the 2° incline, so the adjusted distance is ( 2x times 0.95 - 2 ) meters. 2. The second throw was reduced by 8% due to wind resistance, so the distance thrown was ( x times 0.92 ) meters. It was also reduced by 4 meters due to the 4° incline, so the adjusted distance is ( x times 0.92 - 4 ) meters. 3. The third throw was not affected by wind resistance, so the distance thrown was ( 4x ) meters. It was reduced by 1 meter due to the 1° incline, so the adjusted distance is ( 4x - 1 ) meters. The sum of all three adjusted throws is 1050 meters, so we can write the equation: [ (2x times 0.95 - 2) + (x times 0.92 - 4) + (4x - 1) = 1050 ] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [ 1.9x - 2 + 0.92x - 4 + 4x - 1 = 1050 ] [ 6.82x - 7 = 1050 ] [ 6.82x = 1050 + 7 ] [ 6.82x = 1057 ] [ x = frac{1057}{6.82} ] [ x approx 155 ] So, the second throw was approximately 155 meters before accounting for wind resistance and incline effects.

Now, let's consider the three different scenarios based on the value of ( a ): Case 1: ( a leq -1 ) When ( a leq -1 ), the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) is increasing on ( t in [-1, 1] ). Thus, to ensure that ( f(t) > 0 ) for all ( t in [-1, 1] ), we need: [ f(-1) > 0 ]. Calculate ( f(-1) ): [ f(-1) = (-1 - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(-1) = (1 + 2a + a^2) + 2a - 3 ] [ f(-1) = a^2 + 4a - 2 ]. We need: [ a^2 + 4a - 2 > 0 ]. Solving the quadratic inequality ( a^2 + 4a - 2 > 0 ): [ a^2 + 4a - 2 = 0 ] [ a = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 8}}{2} ] [ a = frac{-4 pm sqrt{24}}{2} ] [ a = frac{-4 pm 2sqrt{6}}{2} ] [ a = -2 pm sqrt{6} ]. Since ( a leq -1 ), we select the negative square root: [ a < -2 - sqrt{6} ]. Case 2: ( -1 < a < 1 ) In this interval, the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) has its minimum at ( t = a ): [ f(a) = (a - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(a) = 2a - 3 ]. To ensure ( f(t) > 0 ): [ 2a - 3 > 0 ] [ a > frac{3}{2} ]. However, this interval ( -1 < a < 1 ) does not contain ( a > frac{3}{2} ). Hence, no values of a satisfy this condition in this case. Case 3: ( a geq 1 ) When ( a geq 1 ), the function ( f(t) = (t - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ) is decreasing on ( t in [-1, 1] ). Thus, to ensure that ( f(t) > 0 ) for all ( t in [-1, 1] ), we need: [ f(1) > 0 ]. Calculate ( f(1) ): [ f(1) = (1 - a)^2 + 2a - 3 ] [ f(1) = (1 - 2a + a^2) + 2a - 3 ] [ f(1) = a^2 - 2 ]. We need: [ a^2 - 2 > 0 ]. Solving the inequality: [ a^2 > 2 ] [ a > sqrt{2} ]. # Conclusion The solution for the real number a such that the given inequality holds for all x is: [ a < -2 - sqrt{6} quad text{or} quad a > sqrt{2} ].

Thus the only consistent scenario is that either all have the same colour, or one of them owns the red stone. Given that Ali and Chaz have the same colour stone and Bev must have a different colour stone: 1. **Scenario**: Assume Ali and Chaz both have green stones. - Bev must then have a red stone. - This configuration is consistent with all derived false statements. 2. **Verify**: - Ali says his stone is the same colour as Bev's → False (Ali's stone is green, Bev's is red). - Bev says her stone is the same colour as Chaz's → False (Bev's stone is red, Chaz's is green). - Chaz says exactly two of them have red stones → False (only Bev has a red stone). # Conclusion: Thus, based on the above reasoning, the correct distribution is that **Ali and Chaz have green stones**, and **Bev has a red stone**.

The given vertices form a pentagon that can be divided into a rectangle and a right triangle. The rectangle is formed by the vertices (-3, 1), (1, 1), (1, -2), and (-3, -2). The right triangle is formed by the vertices (-3, -2), (-2, 0), and (-3, 1). First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the distance between (-3, 1) and (1, 1), which is 1 - (-3) = 4 units. The width of the rectangle is the distance between (-3, 1) and (-3, -2), which is 1 - (-2) = 3 units. So, the area of the rectangle is length × width = 4 × 3 = 12 square units. Next, let's calculate the area of the right triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between (-3, -2) and (-2, 0), which is 2 units (since the y-coordinate changes from -2 to 0). The height of the triangle is the distance between (-2, 0) and (-3, 1), which is 1 unit (since the x-coordinate changes from -2 to -3). The area of a right triangle is (base × height) / 2, so the area of this triangle is (2 × 1) / 2 = 1 square unit. Finally, we add the areas of the rectangle and the triangle to get the total area of the pentagon: 12 + 1 = 13 square units.

I: 1. **Rewrite the expression using modulo arithmetic:** [ 1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n ] can be rewritten as: [ 1^n + 2^n + (5-2)^n + (5-1)^n ] since ( 3^n equiv (5-2)^n pmod{5} ) and ( 4^n equiv (5-1)^n pmod{5} ). 2. **Apply the Binomial Theorem:** Using the binomial expansion, we get: [ (5-2)^n = 5^n - binom{n}{1} 5^{n-1} cdot 2 + ldots pm binom{n}{n-1} 5 cdot 2^{n-1} + (-2)^n ] [ (5-1)^n = 5^n - binom{n}{1} 5^{n-1} + ldots pm binom{n}{n-1} 5 + (-1)^n ] 3. **Simplify the expression modulo 5:** Thus, [ 1^n + 2^n + (5-2)^n + (5-1)^n equiv 1^n + 2^n + (-2)^n + (-1)^n pmod{5} ] 4. **Consider the cases for ( n ):** - If ( n ) is odd: [ 1^n + 2^n + (-2)^n + (-1)^n = 1 + 2 + (-2) + (-1) = 0 quad text{mod 5} ] which means the sum is divisible by 5. - If ( n = 2nu ): [ 1^{2nu} + 2^{2nu} + (-2)^{2nu} + (-1)^{2nu} = 1 + (2^{2nu} + (-2)^{2nu}) = 2(2^{2nu}) + 1 ] If ( nu ) is odd, this is divisible by 5. - However, if ( nu ) is even: [ 2(4^{nu}) + 1 ] which is not divisible by 5 when ( nu ) is even, thus when ( n ) is a multiple of 4, the expression is not divisible by 5. Hence, the expression is divisible by 5 if ( n ) is not a multiple of 4. II: 1. **Consider ( n ) is odd:** Rewrite the expression as: [ A = (5-4)^n + 4^n + (5-3)^n + 3^n ] The binomial expansion of ( (5-4)^n ) will have terms involving ( 5 ). The last term, ( (-4)^n ), being positive or negative depending on ( n ). Similarly for ( 4^n ): [ (5-4)^n + 4^n equiv 0 quad text{mod 5} ] [ (5-3)^n + 3^n equiv 0 quad text{mod 5} ] Thus, ( A ) is divisible by 5. 2. **Consider ( n = 2m ):** When ( n ) is even, rewrite ( A ) as: [ A = (5-1)^m + 1^m + (20-4)^m + 4^m ] If ( m ) is odd, hence ( n ) is not divisible by 4: [ (5-1)^m + 1^m = 0 quad text{mod 5} ] [ (20-4)^m + 4^m = 0 quad text{mod 5} ] If ( m ) is even, hence ( n ) is divisible by 4: [ A = 1^{4m} + 16^{4m} + 81^{4m} + 256^{4m} ] Each of these bases modulo 5 is 1, thus their sum is 4, not divisible by 5. # Conclusion: [ boxed{n text{ is not a multiple of 4}} ] This concludes that the expression ( 1^n + 2^n + 3^n + 4^n ) is divisible by 5 if and only if ( n ) is not divisible by 4."},{"instruction":"Given the function y=x^{2}+1, find: (1) The equation of the tangent line at the point (1,2); (2) The equation of the tangent line passing through the point (1,1).","output":"Solution: From the given function, we have y'=2x.

Since the tangent line passes through the point (1,1), we have 1-(x_{0}^{2}+1)=2x_{0}cdot (1-x_{0}). Therefore, x_{0}=0 or x_{0}=2.

How many gold coins do they have in total?","output":"To solve this problem, let's break down the process and calculations step by step, following the given solution closely. 1. **Identify the Total Coins for Paul and Pete**: At the end of the distribution, Paul has x coins. Since Pete has four times as many coins as Paul, Pete has 4x coins. 2. **Calculate Pete's Total Coins Using the Pattern**: The pattern of distribution is such that Pete gives himself 1, 2, 3, ldots, x coins in each step. The sum of the first x natural numbers is given by the formula frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. Therefore, the total number of coins Pete has can also be represented as frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. 3. **Set Up the Equation**: According to the information, the total coins Pete has can be calculated in two ways: 4x and frac{x(x + 1)}{2}. Setting these equal to each other gives us the equation: [ frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 4x ] 4. **Solve the Equation for x**: To find the value of x, we solve the equation: [ frac{x(x + 1)}{2} = 4x implies x(x + 1) = 8x implies x^2 + x = 8x implies x^2 + x - 8x = 0 implies x^2 - 7x = 0 implies x(x - 7) = 0 ] This gives us x = 0 or x = 7. Since x = 0 doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (as it would mean no coins are distributed), we take x = 7. 5. **Calculate the Total Number of Coins**: The total number of coins is the sum of Paul's and Pete's coins, which is x + 4x = 5x. Substituting x = 7 into this equation gives us: [ 5x = 5(7) = 35 ] Therefore, the total number of gold coins they have is boxed{35}."},{"instruction":"a school, there are two classes, Class A and Class B.

Then, the white cells are repainted in red and blue such that no two adjacent (by a corner) cells have the same color. Let l be a line not parallel to the sides of the cells. For every segment I parallel to l, we compute the difference in the total lengths of its red and blue segments. Prove that there exists a constant C, depending only on l, such that all these differences do not exceed C. 1. **Lemma for Initial Coloring Configuration:** - We start by recoloring the cells of the grid in two colors: odd-numbered columns in green and even-numbered columns in yellow. - **Lemma Statement**: For any segment parallel to l, the difference in the total lengths of its green and yellow segments does not exceed a certain number D, which depends only on l. 2. **Proof of Lemma:** - The line l intersects the vertical sides of the cells breaking the grid into segments of equal length L. - For any segment of length 2L parallel to l, the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow segments are equal to L. - Hence, any segment parallel to l can be divided into such segments and a remainder of length less than 2L. - Consequently, the difference in the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow parts does not exceed 2L. 3. **Extension to the Chessboard Coloring:** - Recolor all black cells into pink and cyan in such a way that pink cells appear in the same columns as red cells and cyan cells appear in the same columns as blue cells.

Substituting these into the expression we want to minimize gives us: 2a_2 + a_6 = frac{2a_4}{q^2} + a_4 q^2 = 4left(frac{2}{q^2} + q^2right). To minimize this expression, we recognize it as a sum of two terms that are inversely proportional.

To form pairs where the sum is divisible by 100, both numbers in the pair must end in 00. The number of ways to pick 2 out of these 21 numbers is given by the combination formula ( C(n, 2) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ): [ C_{21}^{2} = frac{21 cdot 20}{2} = 210 ] So, there are 210 ways in this case. 2.

Let's analyze the given equation: [ frac{|x+y|}{2a} + frac{|x-y|}{2b} = 1 ] where (a) and (b) are two distinct positive constants. We need to determine the type of curve this equation represents. 2. First, consider the coordinate plane divided by the lines (l_1: x-y=0) (i.e., (y=x)) and (l_2: x+y=0) (i.e., (y=-x)) into four quadrants: [ begin{aligned} text{Region I:} &quad x + y geq 0 text{ and } x - y geq 0 text{Region II:} &quad x + y geq 0 text{ and } x - y leq 0 text{Region III:} &quad x + y leq 0 text{ and } x - y leq 0 text{Region IV:} &quad x + y leq 0 text{ and } x - y geq 0 end{aligned} ] 3. Consider Region I, where both (x+y) and (x-y) are non-negative. The equation simplifies to: [ frac{x+y}{2a} + frac{x-y}{2b} = 1 ] 4. To find where this curve intersects the line (x-y=0) (i.e., (l_1)), set (x=y): [ frac{x+x}{2a} + frac{x-x}{2b} = 1 implies frac{2x}{2a} = 1 implies x = a ] Thus, the point of intersection (A) is at ((a, a)). 5. Next, find the intersection with the line (x+y=0) (i.e., (l_2)), set (x=-y): [ frac{x-x}{2a} + frac{x-(-y)}{2b} = 1 implies frac{2x}{2b} = 1 implies x = b ] Thus, the point of intersection (B) is at ((b, -b)). 6. Repeat a similar analysis for the other regions: - In Region II, the equation simplifies similarly, but (x-y) changes sign. - In Region III, both terms change signs. - In Region IV, (x+y) changes sign. 7. Solve the equations in all four regions and find the vertices: - In Region II, intersecting (l_1) and (l_2) respectively gives points ((-b, b)). - Similarly, for regions III and IV, find the intersection points ((-a, -a)) and ((-b, b)). 8. The vertices obtained are: ((a, a)), ((b, -b)), ((-a, -a)), and ((-b, b)). 9. Since (AC perp BD) and (AC neq BD), this is concluded to be a rhombus because the distances (AC) and (BD) vary due to (a neq b). 10. To confirm further, rotate the coordinate system to align new axes: - Let (x' = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(x+y)) and (y' = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}(-x+y)). - The transformed equation simplifies to: [ frac{|x'|}{a} + frac{|y'|}{b} = sqrt{2} ] 11.

The speed of A, S_A, can be calculated using the distance A covers (which is the full 1000 meters) and the time A takes (which is 92 seconds): S_A = Distance_A / Time_A S_A = 1000 meters / 92 seconds S_A = 10.8696 meters/second (approximately) Now, we can use the speed of A to find out how long it would take B to cover the remaining 80 meters. Since A and B are running at the same time and A finishes 80 meters before B, the time it takes A to run 80 meters is the time by which A beats B.

We are to find the maximum volume of cylinders placed within a region of the pyramid, given a certain height (h). 1. **Projection and the Base of the Cylinder:** Let's start by considering the projection of the given polyhedron (ABC A_1 M N C_1) onto the plane (A_1 B_1 C_1). Here, (M) and (N) are the midpoints of edges (A_1B_1) and (B_1C_1) respectively, and (|C_1 O| = 3) where (O) is the centroid of (triangle ABC). 2. **Determining the Trapezoid:** In the plane (A_1 B_1 C_1), the projection of the section taken at height (h) above (A_1 B_1 C_1) will form a trapezoid (KLNC_1). The trapezoid's sides are calculated based on the chosen height (h). 3. **Segment Measurements for the Projection:** If (h = 3), the section’s plane coincides with the base plane (ABC), resulting in points (K) and (L) being midpoints of segments (A_1C_1) and (B_1C_1).

This happens specifically when: - ( x = 0 ), - ( y = 0 ), - or ( x + y = 2pi ). Hence, the minimum value, ( f_{text{min}} = 0). 6. **Finding the Maximum Value:** To find the maximum value, we note: - ( sin t leq 1 ) for ( 0 leq t leq pi ).

We can rearrange the equation to solve for S/C: S/C = 40/100 S/C = 2/5 This means that the selling price is 2/5 of the cost price. To find the loss percent, we need to see how much less the selling price is compared to the cost price.

The possible placement of the second blue face can only be on the opposite side to the first, as any adjacent placement will use up either a red or yellow position that has equal count requirements. With the blue face fixed on two opposite sides, this leaves four sides remaining for the red and yellow, two of each color. By fixing one red side adjacent to a fixed blue side, the placement of the second red side can be any of the remaining three sides (not opposite the first fixed red). Having placed the two red sides, the remaining two sides must be yellow and are placed automatically without any flexibility, thus the arrangement is dictated. Counting the arrangements: - The choice for placing the first red adjacent to an arbitrary blue is 4 (top, bottom, or two sides not opposite blue). - The choice for placing the second red is 3 (as it can't be opposite to the first red and must leave room for the yellow). The total number of arrangements by multiplication of choices turns out to be [4 times 3 = 12]. However, this overcounts, as it treats some arrangements as distinct when they might be rotated into each other. Taking rotational symmetry into the account, where each color appears exactly on two opposite faces twice, the actual number of distinct configurations can be divided by the rotational symmetry order of the cube having pairs of opposite faces painted the same color (which in this case would typically reduce the scenarios by a factor that considers rotations about multiple axes). Calculating considering cube symmetry, we realize each arrangement considers all rotations inherently. Thus, the correct counting is [12 div 6 = 2] unique configurations, counting each unique rotation as one.

According to the information given: GP = 170% of C GP = 1.7 * C We also know that the sales price (SP) is the sum of the cost and the gross profit: SP = C + GP Given that the sales price is 81: 81 = C + GP 81 = C + 1.7 * C 81 = 2.7 * C Now, we can solve for C: C = 81 / 2.7 C = 30 Now that we have the cost, we can calculate the gross profit: GP = 1.7 * C GP = 1.7 * 30 GP = 51 Therefore, the value of the gross profit is boxed{51} ."},{"instruction":"Morse codelike encoding, each symbol is represented by a sequence of dashes and dots.

How can you determine the heaviest weight with no more than two weighings?","output":"1. **Understand the Problem Context and Variables:** We need to identify the heaviest of four weights that form an increasing geometric progression. Let the weights be denoted by (a), (aq), (aq^2), and (aq^3), where (a > 0) and (q > 1). 2. **Formulate the Key Insight:** The heaviest weight should be heavier than the sum of any pair of the remaining weights. Thus, we need to prove: [ a + aq^3 > aq + aq^2 ] 3. **Rewrite the Inequality:** Let's rewrite the inequality using algebra: [ a(1 + q^3) > aq(1 + q) ] We can divide both sides of the inequality by (a), which is positive, hence we get: [ 1 + q^3 > q + q^2 ] 4. **Simplify and Factorize:** Subtracting (q + q^2) from both sides, we have: [ 1 + q^3 - q - q^2 > 0 ] This can be factorized as: [ (1 - q + q^2)(1 + q) > 0 ] Since (q > 1), both factors ((1 - q + q^2)) and ((1 + q)) are positive. Thus, the inequality holds. 5. **Verification Step Using Inequality:** We used Cauchy-Schwarz (AM-GM) inequality in the reference solution. For any real numbers (x) and (y): [ x^2 + y^2 geq 2xy ] Setting (x = 1) and (y = q), we have: [ (1)^2 + (q)^2 geq 2(1)(q) ] [ 1 + q^2 geq 2q ] We used the fact that (1 - q + q^2 geq q) to conclude our inequality. 6. **Steps to Find the Heaviest Weight:** a. Choose any two pairs of weights and weigh them: [ text{Weigh } (a, aq^3) text{ against } (aq, aq^2) ] b. The heaviest pair will contain (aq^3). 7. **Final Verification:** To ensure the heaviest weight is in the heaviest pair, place the two weights on scales: [ text{Heaviest of } (aq^3) quad text{and other weight} ] 8. **Conclusion:** This method will always identify the heaviest weight with at most two weighings.

That is, there exist natural numbers ( m_a ) and ( p_a ) with ( m_a > p_a geq 1 ) such that ( a^{m_a} = a^{p_a} ). 2. **Extend the equality to all subsequent powers:** Once we have ( a^{m_a} = a^{p_a} ), we can extend this to show that ( a^{m_a + k} = a^{p_a + k} ) for all non-negative integers ( k ). This follows from the properties of exponents in a ring: [ a^{m_a + k} = a^{p_a + k} quad text{for all } k geq 0. ] Specifically, for ( k = m_a - p_a ), we have: [ a^{m_a + (m_a - p_a)} = a^{p_a + (m_a - p_a)} implies a^{2m_a - p_a} = a^{m_a}. ] By induction, it follows that: [ a^{n + ell(m_a - p_a)} = a^n quad text{for all } n geq p_a text{ and } ell geq 0. ] 3. **Define ( p ) and ( m ) for the entire ring:** To ensure that the equality ( a^m = a^p ) holds for all ( a in A ), we need to find common values of ( m ) and ( p ). Let: [ p = max_{a in A} p_a, ] and [ m = p + prod_{a in A} (m_a - p_a). ] Here, ( p ) is the maximum of all ( p_a ) values, ensuring that ( p geq p_a ) for all ( a in A ). The product ( prod_{a in A} (m_a - p_a) ) is a common multiple of all differences ( m_a - p_a ), ensuring that ( m ) is sufficiently large to satisfy the equality for all elements in ( A ). 4. **Verify the equality for all ( a in A ):** For any ( a in A ), since ( m ) is constructed as ( p + prod_{a in A} (m_a - p_a) ), it follows that: [ m = p + k(m_a - p_a) quad text{for some integer } k. ] Therefore, we have: [ a^m = a^{p + k(m_a - p_a)} = a^p. ] This shows that ( a^m = a^p ) for all ( a in A ).

Therefore: C_{text{base circle}} = pi cdot a The slant height of the cone will be the same as the radius of the semicircle, which is frac{a}{2}. Now, if we consider the right triangle formed by the axis of the cone, the radius of the base, and the slant height of the cone (just one part of the cone's axis cross-section), we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: text{axis length}^{2} + left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} = left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} text{axis length}^{2} + frac{a^2}{4} = frac{a^2}{4} text{axis length}^{2} = frac{a^2}{4} - frac{a^2}{4} text{axis length}^{2} = 0 However, this result is not logically possible since the axis of a cone cannot have a length of 0. There must have been a mistake in the assumption that the slant height of the cone is the same as the radius of the base. Instead, the slant height is the radius of the semicircle which is frac{a}{2}, and the radius of base circle is frac{a}{2}. The axis of the cone is the perpendicular height h from the center of the base to the apex. By applying the Pythagorean theorem correctly: h^{2} + left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} = left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} h^{2} = left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} - left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} h^{2} = left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2} h = frac{a}{2} Here, the axis (height h), the slant height (frac{a}{2}), and the radius (frac{a}{2}) of the base form an isosceles triangle with all sides equal, which is an equilateral triangle.

What was the original daily production quantity of protective suits?","output":"To solve this problem, we start by letting the original daily production quantity of protective suits be x sets. This means, before the efficiency increase, the factory could produce x sets of protective suits per day. Given that the efficiency of producing protective suits has increased by 20%, the new efficiency allows the factory to produce protective suits at 120% of the original speed. Therefore, the new production rate can be represented as 1.2x sets per day. The problem states that now, the time it takes to produce 2400 sets of protective suits is 1 day less than the time it took to produce 2200 sets of protective suits before the efficiency increase. We can translate this information into an equation based on the time it takes to produce these sets of protective suits, both before and after the efficiency increase. Before the efficiency increase, the time to produce 2200 sets is frac{2200}{x} days. After the efficiency increase, the time to produce 2400 sets is frac{2400}{1.2x} days. According to the problem, the difference in these times is 1 day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{2200}{x} - frac{2400}{1.2x} = 1 ] To solve this equation, we first simplify the fraction on the right side: [ frac{2200}{x} - frac{2400}{1.2x} = frac{2200}{x} - frac{2400}{1.2 cdot x} = frac{2200}{x} - frac{2400}{1.2 cdot x} = frac{2200}{x} - frac{2000}{x} = 1 ] This simplifies to: [ frac{2200 - 2000}{x} = 1 ] [ frac{200}{x} = 1 ] Multiplying both sides by x to solve for x, we get: [ 200 = x ] Therefore, the original daily production quantity of protective suits was boxed{200} sets."},{"instruction":"m fetched a total simple interest of 4020.75 at the rate of 9 % . p . a . in 5 years . what is the sum ?","output":"To find the sum, we can use the simple interest formula: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (R) * Time (T) / 100 We are given: Simple Interest (SI) = 4020.75 Rate (R) = 9% per annum Time (T) = 5 years We need to find the Principal (P).

So, its area is: Area of road 2 = width * length = 10 m * 80 m = 800 sq m However, we must note that where the two roads intersect, the area is being counted twice. The intersection is a square with a side of 10 m (the width of the roads). So, we need to subtract the area of the intersection from the total area of the two roads. Area of intersection = side * side = 10 m * 10 m = 100 sq m Now, we can calculate the total area of the roads without double-counting the intersection: Total area of roads = Area of road 1 + Area of road 2 - Area of intersection Total area of roads = 600 sq m + 800 sq m - 100 sq m Total area of roads = 1400 sq m - 100 sq m Total area of roads = 1300 sq m Now, to find the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs. 3 per sq m, we multiply the total area by the cost per square meter: Total cost = Total area of roads * cost per sq m Total cost = 1300 sq m * Rs. 3/sq m Total cost = Rs. 3900 Therefore, the cost of traveling the two roads is Rs. boxed{3900} ."},{"instruction":"Veronica's flashlight was bright enough to be seen at night from a distance of 1000 feet.

This implies (P(p-x) = P(x)) consistently. Generally, we deduce the polynomial has integer roots since ((x, p-x)) symmetry. 7. **Special Case (p = 0):** If (p = 0), this implies (P(x) = -P(-x)).

The key property of inversion is that it preserves the angles but not the distances. 2. **Fixed Circle mathcal{C}(O, R)**: Under this inversion, the line ell (which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC) is mapped to a circle mathcal{C}(O, R) with center O and radius R. The points B and C on ell are mapped to points X and Y on mathcal{C} such that XY is a diameter of mathcal{C}. 3. **Circumcircle (PXY)**: We need to show that the circumcircle of triangle BPC (which is now (PXY) after inversion) passes through a fixed point other than P. 4. **Intersection Point Q**: Let Q be the intersection of the line PO with the circle (PXY). By the power of a point theorem, we have: [ OP cdot OQ = OX cdot OY = R^2 ] This implies that Q is a fixed point because R is constant (the radius of the fixed circle mathcal{C}). 5. **Conclusion**: Since Q is fixed and lies on the circumcircle (PXY) for any right triangle ABC with hypotenuse on ell, we have shown that the circumcircle of triangle BPC passes through a fixed point other than P.

This implies that at the 11th list stage, every player has communicated directly or indirectly with every other player, meaning the directed graph must be connected within 11 steps. 3. **Cycle Consideration**: Consider a path in the graph where player A_1 wins against A_2, A_2 wins against A_3, and so on, forming a cycle A_1 to A_2 to A_3 to ldots to A_{12}. 4. **Limitation on Victories**: Notice that for the sequence to ensure communication in no more than 11 directed steps, no intermediate player (A_i with 1 < i < 12) could win against A_1, or else the communication would have been achieved within fewer than 11 steps due to the cycle.

Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: [ frac{a+2b+c}{(a+b)(b+c)} = frac{3}{a+b+c} ] 4. Cross-multiplying both sides, we obtain: [ (a+2b+c)(a+b+c) = 3(a+b)(b+c) ] 5.

The maximum perimeter of the minimal covering rectangle for such a figure is ( 4n ). - To make the figure connected, we need to shift the cells such that they share edges. Each shift reduces the perimeter by at least 2. - We need ( n-1 ) shifts to make the figure fully connected. Each shift reduces the perimeter by at least 2, so the total reduction is at least ( 2(n-1) ). - Therefore, the perimeter of the connected figure is at most: [ 4n - 2(n-1) = 4n - 2n + 2 = 2n + 2 ] 5. **Maximizing the Area:** - The area ( S(f_n) ) of the minimal rectangle is given by the product of its width and height. - To maximize ( S(f_n) ), we need to consider the configuration of the cells.

D: In linear regression analysis, the regression line obtained using the method of least squares ensures that the sum of residuals for all data points is zero.","output":"To analyze each statement step-by-step and determine which are correct, we proceed as follows: **Statement A**: Subtracting the same number from each data point in a set does not change the variance. This is because the variance is calculated based on the differences between each data point and the mean of the data set. Subtracting a constant from each data point also subtracts the same constant from the mean, leaving the differences unchanged. Therefore, the variance remains the same.

The sum of residuals is given by sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-widehat{y}_i). By the method of least squares, this sum equals to noverline{y}-hat{b}noverline{x}-nhat{a}, which simplifies to n(overline{y}-hat{b}overline{x}-hat{a}).

This is done to isolate the variable on one side. Step 1: Add 1 to both sides of the inequality. [x - 1 + 1 > 2 + 1] Step 2: Simplify both sides. [x > 3] Thus, by adding 1 to both sides of the inequality, we have transformed the inequality to x > 3. This is based on the property of inequalities that adding or subtracting the same number from both sides does not change the direction of the inequality. **Transformation for Inequality (2):** Given: -4x > 8 To solve for x, we apply another property of inequalities that allows us to multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by a number. However, when we multiply or divide by a negative number, the direction of the inequality changes. Step 1: Divide both sides of the inequality by -4. [frac{-4x}{-4} < frac{8}{-4}] Note: The direction of the inequality changes because we are dividing by a negative number. Step 2: Simplify both sides. [x < -2] Thus, by dividing both sides of the inequality by -4, we have transformed the inequality to x < -2. This is based on the property of inequalities that dividing both sides by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality. Therefore, the basis for the transformation of the given inequalities is the application of basic properties of inequalities: adding or subtracting the same number from both sides (for the first inequality) and dividing both sides by a negative number (for the second inequality), which also involves reversing the direction of the inequality. Final Answer: - For (1): x > 3 is obtained by adding 1 to both sides. - For (2): x < -2 is obtained by dividing both sides by -4 and reversing the inequality direction.

Point ( D ) is on the line through ( B ) parallel to ( AC ), and ( D ) and ( C ) are on the same side of the line ( AB ). The perpendicular bisector of ( CD ) intersects the line ( AB ) at point ( E ). 2. **Symmetric Point**: Let ( A' ) be the symmetric point of ( A ) with respect to line ( BC ). Since ( triangle ABC ) is equilateral, reflecting ( A ) over ( BC ) will place ( A' ) such that ( triangle BA'C ) is also equilateral. 3. **Corresponding Point**: Let ( D' ) be the corresponding point of ( D ) in ( triangle BA'C ). Since ( D ) lies on the line through ( B ) parallel to ( AC ), and ( D' ) is the reflection of ( D ) over ( BC ), ( D' ) will lie on the line through ( B ) parallel to ( A'C ). 4. **Equilateral Triangle Formation**: By construction, ( triangle CDD' ) is equilateral because ( D' ) is the reflection of ( D ) over ( BC ), and ( triangle BA'C ) is equilateral.

Is it true that for any pair of cities, the prince can rename all the cities so that the first city is named with the name of the second city, the second city is named with the name of the first city, and the king would not notice the changes?","output":"1. **Define the problem:**    We need to determine whether the prince can rename all cities in the kingdom in such a way that for any ordered pair of cities, the first city is named with the name of the second city, and vice versa, so that the king does not notice any changes.     2. **Understand the kingdom's graph:**    Assume the cities and their connections are depicted in a graph where cities are vertices and railroads are edges. The condition implies that any renaming should maintain the connectivity structure of the graph. 3. **Analyzing the renaming scenario:**    Suppose we rename cities in such a way that city A is renamed to B and B to A, etc. To satisfy the condition, the resulting renamed graph should look exactly the same as the original graph.     4. **Consider graph symmetry:**    If the graph had full symmetry, any renaming preserving this symmetry would make the task feasible. However, not all graphs are symmetric. For instance, if the graph depicted a polyhedron with identical edges, renaming vertices following the polyhedron's symmetry would preserve connectivity. 5. **Check specific example:**    Consider a specific renaming example of cities B and D. Let's examine if such a rename will go unnoticed by the king. If cities B and D exchange names, the renamed adjacency list should still correspond to the same connections.        - **City A connectivity analysis:**      - Assume city A originally connects to both B and D.      - After swapping B and D, city A would connect to renamed D and B.      However, if city A only connected to B before the rename and not to D, the king would notice the rename since the unique connectivity pattern of A would change. 6. **Conclusion with an example:**    Suppose the cities are arranged in a specific polyhedral structure such as the one given in the reference picture. For such a structure derived from a regular tetrahedron, renaming based on simple symmetry does not hide changes due to uniquely identifying connectivity patterns for specific cities.         # Conclusion: Thus, for any pair of cities A and B, the prince cannot always rename cities so that A has the name B and B has the name A without the king noticing changes in the connectivity structure. boxed{text{False}}"},{"instruction":"he ratio 2 : 3 expressed as a percent equal","output":"To express the ratio 2:3 as a percent, you first need to understand that a ratio compares two quantities.

It is well-known that ( O_1X parallel 2CA ) and ( O_2Y parallel 2CA ). This implies that ( O_1X parallel O_2Y ). 4. Consider the angles ( angle KO_1L ) and ( angle NO_2M ). It is well-known that ( angle KO_1L = 2angle KCL ). Since ( ABCD ) is cyclic, we have ( angle KCL = angle BCD ). 5. Since ( angle BCD = 180^circ - angle BAD ), we have ( angle KO_1L = 2(180^circ - angle BAD) = 2angle MCN ). Therefore, ( angle KO_1L = angle NO_2M ). 6. Since ( O_1X parallel O_2Y ) and ( angle KO_1L = angle NO_2M ), we deduce that ( triangle O_1KL cong triangle O_2NM ). 7. This implies that ( O_1K = O_2N ) and ( O_1L = O_2M ).

Prove that your answer is correct.","output":"1. **Introduction and Insight**:    - You have coins with values: (1), (2), (5), (10), and (20) florins.    - You have to figure out the values of these coins by buying candies that cost (1) florin each.    - Each time you pay more than (1) florin, you receive change in florins. 2. **Step-by-Step Justification for the Number of Candies Needed**:    - **Less than 4 Candies:**            Suppose you try to identify the coins by buying 3 candies:      - If you use any combination of the (1)-, (2)-, and (5)-florin coins, you might not receive change that includes the (10)- and (20)-florin coins.      - Without receiving these higher-valued coins in change, you cannot tell their values apart, thus making it impossible to identify all 5 coins for sure.    - **4 Candies:**      Let's see how buying 4 candies (each time with a different coin) suffices to identify all coins:      - **First Transaction**:                Pay with any coin. If it is the (1)-florin coin, you will not receive any change. If it's any other coin, you will receive change.      - **Second Transaction**:                Repeat with a different coin.      - **Third Transaction**:                Repeat again with a different coin.      - **Fourth Transaction**:                Use the remaining coin.      Now analyze the outcomes:      - **Determine the (1)-florin coin**:                - If any transaction does not produce change, the coin used is the (1)-florin coin.        - If all transactions produce change, the (1)-florin coin was not used in any transaction, thus it must be the remaining unidentified coin.      - **Determine the (2)-florin coin**:                Use the change received to identify the (2)-florin coin:        - If you receive a (1)-florin coin as change in any transaction, the coin used in that transaction was a (2)-florin coin since you now know what a (1)-florin coin looks like.      - **Determine the (5)-florin coin**:                Consider the change received from transactions:        - If a transaction produces change worth 4 florins (four (1)-florin coins or two (2)-florin coins), or a combination thereof, the coin used must be the (5)-florin coin.      - **Determine the (10)-florin coin**:                Similar to previous steps, analyze the change:        - If a transaction generates change worth (9) florins, it must come from using a (10)-florin coin.      - **Determine the (20)-florin coin**:                By process of elimination, the remaining unidentified coin will be the (20)-florin coin. # Conclusion: To determine the values of the coins with certainty, you need to buy at least 4 candies, using each type of coin at least once in transactions. boxed{4}"},{"instruction":"f the consecutive integers from 100 to 1 were written as 1009998979695..., what would be the 150^{text{th}} digit to be written?","output":"To find the 150^{text{th}} digit: 1.

Since the sum of scores of the first two tests equals the sum of the scores of the last two tests, and the first two scores are 82 and 76, we have (82 + 76 = 158).

Therefore, y^{2}= dfrac {b^{4}}{a^{2}}, which implies y=± dfrac {b^{2}}{a}. Thus, A(c, dfrac {b^{2}}{a}) and B(c,- dfrac {b^{2}}{a}). Hence, |AB|= dfrac {2b^{2}}{a}.

Since (b) is a positive integer, there are infinitely many primes that do not divide (b). 4. **Solve the congruence (1009a + bx equiv 0 pmod{r})**:    The congruence (1009a + bx equiv 0 pmod{r}) has a solution because (r) does not divide (b).

Given (z neq 0) and (z neq 2mathrm{i}), this implies ( B neq pm 1 ). 5. **Properties of A and B**:    - Because we know (frac{B-1}{B+1}) is purely imaginary (since it is a value on the unit circle except for (pm 1)), these values produce a purely imaginary result.    - To ensure the entire product (frac{A - 1}{A + 1} cdot frac{B - 1}{B + 1}) is real, (frac{A - 1}{A + 1}) must also be purely imaginary. 6. **Condition for (A)**:    - For (frac{A - 1}{A + 1}) to be purely imaginary, ( |A| = 1 ) and ( A neq pm 1 ).    - Since ( A = frac{omega - mathrm{i}}{-mathrm{i}} ), this translation means that ( |omega - mathrm{i}| = 1 ). 7. **Conclusion**:    - The points in the complex plane for (omega) which satisfy this are all points on the circle centered at ( (0, 1) ) with radius 1. However, (omega neq 0) and (omega neq 2mathrm{i}).

The modulus (absolute value) of the vectors mathbf{p}, -mathbf{p}', and mathbf{p}'' are equal (since rotation does not change the magnitude of vectors) and are non-zero.

There are two possible orientations for this equilateral triangle:    - If following mathbf{p} is -mathbf{p}' and then mathbf{p}'' in counter-clockwise (positive) direction (see Figure 1).    - If following mathbf{p} is mathbf{p}'' and then -mathbf{p}' in counter-clockwise (positive) direction (see Figure 2). 4.

Possible values of k are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100. 3. **Finding the Minimum k**:     - Calculate the smallest k for which:     [     1978^k equiv 1 pmod{125}     ]     - Recall:     1978 equiv 3 pmod{5}     [     1978^4 equiv 1 pmod{5} quad (text{Fermat's Little Theorem})     ]     - k must be a multiple of K = 4 and chosen from possible values 4, 20, 100.     - Check 3^{20} pmod{125} using repeated squaring:         1. 3^{2} = 9         2. 3^{4} = (3^{2})^{2} = 81         3. 3^{8} = 81^{2} = 6561 equiv 61 pmod{125}         4. 3^{16} = 61^{2} = 3721 equiv 96 pmod{125}         5. 3^{20} = 3^{16} times 3^{4} equiv 96 times 81 = 7776 equiv 1 pmod{125}              - Hence, k=20 is the smallest value for which 1978^{20} equiv 1 pmod{125}. # Conclusion: To minimize m+n, we use m=3 and n=m+k=3+20=23: [ m+n=3+23=26 ] So the smallest m+n that satisfies the conditions is: [ boxed{26} ]"},{"instruction":"Given (S= C_{27}^{1}+ C_{27}^{2}+ C_{27}^{3}+ldots+ C_{27}^{27}), find the remainder when (S) is divided by (9).","output":"We have (S= C_{27}^{1}+ C_{27}^{2}+ C_{27}^{3}+ldots+ C_{27}^{27}=(1+1)^{27}-1=8^{9}-1=(9-1)^{9}-1=9^{9}- binom{9}{1}times9^{8}+ldots+ binom{9}{8}9-2)   (=9(9^{8}- binom{9}{1}9^{7}+ldots+ binom{9}{8})-9+7),   Therefore, the remainder of (S) divided by (9) is (7).

We want to prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers (n) for which (a_n) is divisible by 3. 2. **Assumption**: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many such (n).

Thus, ( delta(G) = Delta(G) = 3 ). 3. **Cycle Length Not Divisible by 3**:    We need to show that there exists a cycle in ( G ) whose length is not divisible by 3. This can be generalized to showing that for any positive integer ( lambda > 2 ), a graph ( G ) with ( delta(G) geq 3 ) contains a cycle of length not divisible by ( lambda ). 4. **Longest Path Argument**:    Consider a longest path ( P = v_0v_1ldots v_k ) in ( G ). Since ( P ) is the longest path, all neighbors of ( v_0 ) must be contained in ( P ). Therefore, there must exist indices ( 1 < i < j leq k ) such that ( v_0v_i ) and ( v_0v_j ) are edges in ( E ). 5. **Cycle Formation**:    - ( gamma_1 = v_0v_1ldots v_iv_0 ) is a cycle of length ( i+1 ).    - ( gamma_2 = v_0v_1ldots v_jv_0 ) is a cycle of length ( j+1 ).    - ( gamma_3 = v_0v_ildots v_jv_0 ) is a cycle of length ( j-i+2 ). 6. **Divisibility Argument**:    Assume ( lambda ) divides all three cycle lengths ( i+1 ), ( j+1 ), and ( j-i+2 ). Then:    [    lambda mid (j+1) - (i+1) = j - i    ]    [    lambda mid (j-i+2) - 2 = j - i    ]    This implies ( lambda mid 2 ), which is a contradiction since ( lambda > 2 ). 7. **Special Case for (lambda = 2)**:    For ( lambda = 2 ), consider the cube graph ( ABCDA'B'C'D' ). This graph is bipartite with shores ( {A, B', C, D'} ) and ( {A', B, C', D} ), meaning all its cycles are of even length. Thus, the argument does not hold for ( lambda = 2 ). Since the assumption that ( lambda ) divides all three cycle lengths leads to a contradiction, there must exist at least one cycle in ( G ) whose length is not divisible by ( lambda ). Specifically, for ( lambda = 3 ), there exists a cycle in the 3-regular graph ( G ) whose length is not divisible by 3.

The number of positive integers is 8. What is the number if it is known that 8 positive integers divide evenly into it?","output":"To find a number that has exactly 8 positive divisors, we need to consider the prime factorization of the number. The number of divisors of a number can be determined by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying these together. For example, if a number has a prime factorization of ( p^a cdot q^b ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct prime numbers and ( a ) and ( b ) are their respective exponents, then the number of divisors ( d ) that the number has is given by ( d = (a+1)(b+1) ). Since we want the number to have exactly 8 divisors, we need to find exponents such that their incremented products equal 8. The number 8 can be factored into ( 8 = 2^3 ), which suggests that one way to have 8 divisors is to have a prime raised to the power of 7 (since ( 7+1 = 8 )). So, one possible number with exactly 8 divisors is ( 2^7 = 128 ). The divisors of 128 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, which are indeed 8 divisors. Another way to have 8 divisors is to have a number with a prime factorization involving two different primes, such as ( p^1 cdot q^3 ), since ( (1+1)(3+1) = 2 cdot 4 = 8 ). An example of this would be ( 2^1 cdot 3^3 = 2 cdot 27 = 54 ). The divisors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54, which also gives us 8 divisors.

For a tangent passing through a point outside the parabola, say (x_1, y_1), the equation of the tangent can be derived using the point-slope form and the condition that it must satisfy the parabola's equation at the point of tangency.

Notably, ( 66 = 2 times 33 ), so ( 66 ) is a composite of numbers less than 65, and hence ( A + B ) is also divisible by 66.    - Consider 67, which is a prime number greater than 65. 5. **Contradiction Example**:    - Set ( A = 65! ) and ( B = 2 times 65! ).    - Then, ( A + B = 65! + 2 times 65! = 3 times 65! ).    - Note that ( 3 times 65! ) does not necessarily have 67 as a factor because 67 is not included in the factors of ( 65! ). 6. **Conclusion**:    - Since ( A + B = 3 times 65! ) is not guaranteed to be divisible by 67, we conclude that the smallest natural number which ( A + B ) might not be divisible by is **67**.

Each divisor either falls into the 'even' or 'odd' product of prime numbers category.    - Specifically, if there are n even product divisors (contributing +1 each) and n odd product divisors (contributing -1 each), then:      [      sum (text{divisors of } N_k) = n cdot (+1) + n cdot (-1) = n - n = 0.      ]    - For N_{k+1} = N_k cdot p_{k+1}, the new divisors are formed by multiplying each original divisor of N_k by p_{k+1}.      - Multiplying an \\"even\\" divisor of N_k by p_{k+1} results in an \\"odd\\" product divisor because you are introducing one additional prime multiplier.      - Similarly, multiplying an \\"odd\\" divisor of N_k by p_{k+1} results in an \\"even\\" product divisor.      This means that every even product (under N_k) becomes an odd product (under N_{k+1}) and vice versa.      Therefore, the count of 'even' and 'odd' product divisors remains balanced in total, ensuring that the sum stays zero:      - You will have the same count of \`+1\` and \`-1\` terms as before, but classified differently.      - This still results in:        [        +1 cdot (number  of  even  product  divisors)  +  (-1) cdot (number of odd  product  divisors)  = 0        ] 4. **Conclusion:**    By induction, the original statement is true for every ( k ):    - The sum of all marked values (either +1 or -1) under the given rules always equals zero for any ( N_k ). Therefore, the sum of all values written below the divisors is zero for N = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot 37.

What is the maximum number of edges of such a prism that can be intersected by a plane not passing through its vertices?","output":"To determine the maximum number of edges a plane can intersect in a convex prism with a base that is a 2015-gon, follow these steps: 1. **Identify the Prism Properties:**    - A prism with a base that is a convex 2015-gon has 2015 edges on the top base and 2015 edges on the bottom base.    - There are also 2015 vertical edges connecting corresponding vertices of the top and bottom bases, making a total of:      [      2015 + 2015 + 2015 = 3 times 2015      ]      edges in the prism. 2. **Section Formation:**    - Consider a plane intersecting the prism. This intersection will create a cross-section within the prism.    - If the plane intersects (N) edges of the prism, it results in an (N)-gon as the cross-section. For example, a simple plane intersecting a cube (a rectangular prism) could produce a quadrilateral, a pentagon, etc.    - The cross-section created by a plane will intersect a certain number of edges and therefore faces of the prism. 3. **Maximum Intersection Rule:**    - It is known that a cross-section of a convex polyhedron cannot have more sides than the number of faces of the polyhedron it intersects.     - Since the prism's base is a convex 2015-gon, the prism itself, being a straight prism, has (2015 + 2) faces: 2015 lateral faces (each a parallelogram), one top face, and one bottom face.    - This gives a maximum number of faces equal to (2015 + 2 = 2017) when a plane intersects the prism. 4. **Verification:**    - To understand this further, consider a simpler example of a pentagonal prism. It has:      [      5 text{ lateral faces} + 2 text{ base faces} = 7 text{ total faces}      ]    - If the plane intersects all 7 faces, it can create a cross-section with up to 7 sides. 5. **Conclusion:**    - By extension, for a 2015-gon based prism, the number of intersected faces (and thus potentially the number of edges intersected) can be up to 2017.     Thus, the maximum number of edges a plane can intersect in this prism, without passing through any vertices, is: [ boxed{2017} ]"},{"instruction":"As shown in the figure, the set of complex numbers corresponding to the shaded region (including the boundary) in the complex plane is: A. left{z ;|; |z| = 1, frac{pi}{6} leqslant arg z leqslant frac{5}{6} pi, z in mathbf{C}right} B. left{z ;|; |z| leqslant 1, frac{pi}{6} leqslant arg z leqslant frac{5}{6} pi, z in mathbf{C}right} C. left{z ;|; |z| = 1, operatorname{Im} z geqslant frac{1}{2}, z in mathbf{C}right} D. left{z ;|; |z| leqslant 1, operatorname{Im} z geqslant frac{1}{2}, z in mathbf{C}right}","output":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric representation of each of the given choices and determine which one corresponds to the shadowed area in the given complex plane. 1. **Translate Each Option into Geometric Representation:**     **Option A**:     [     left{ z mid |z| = 1, frac{pi}{6} leq arg z leq frac{5}{6} pi, z in mathbf{C} right}     ]     This represents all points on the unit circle with arguments between (frac{pi}{6}) and (frac{5}{6} pi).     **Option B**:     [     left{ z mid |z| leq 1, frac{pi}{6} leq arg z leq frac{5}{6} pi, z in mathbf{C} right}     ]     This represents all points within or on the unit circle with arguments between (frac{pi}{6}) and (frac{5}{6} pi).     **Option C**:     [     left{ z mid |z| = 1, operatorname{Im} z geq frac{1}{2}, z in mathbf{C} right}     ]     This represents all points on the unit circle where the imaginary part is greater than or equal to (frac{1}{2}).     **Option D**:     [     left{ z mid |z| leq 1, operatorname{Im} z geq frac{1}{2}, z in mathbf{C} right}     ]     This represents all points within or on the unit circle where the imaginary part is greater than or equal to (frac{1}{2}). 2. **Determine the Shadowed Area:**     We need to identify the shaded area within the complex plane that contains all points within the unit circle ((|z| leq 1)) and has an imaginary part ((operatorname{Im} z)) which is greater than or equal to (frac{1}{2}). 3. **Compare with the Options:**     The stipulated region for the shadowed part represents all points (z) such that:     - (|z| leq 1)     - (operatorname{Im} z geq frac{1}{2})     Comparing this with our given choices, it matches option D. 4. **Conclusion**:     The complex set corresponding to the shadowed portion is:     (boxed{text{D}})"},{"instruction":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,1) and overrightarrow{b}=(1,m), and the obtuse angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, the range of real number m is ( ).

First, let's find the cost price for the retailer: The retailer buys 120 pens for the price of 36 pens. This means that for every 36 pens, the retailer gets 120 pens. So, the cost price per pen for the retailer is the price of 1 pen divided by the ratio of 120/36. Let's assume the market price of 1 pen is 1 (for simplicity, since the actual price is not given). Then the market price of 36 pens would be 36 * 1 = 36. Now, the cost price for 120 pens would be 36 (since the retailer gets 120 pens for the price of 36 pens). Next, let's find the selling price: The retailer sells the pens with a 1% discount. If the market price of 1 pen is 1, then the selling price of 1 pen after a 1% discount would be: SP per pen = Market Price per pen - Discount SP per pen = 1 - (1% of 1) SP per pen = 1 - (1 * 0.01) SP per pen = 1 - 0.01 SP per pen = 0.99 The selling price for 120 pens would be: SP for 120 pens = 120 * SP per pen SP for 120 pens = 120 * 0.99 SP for 120 pens = 118.80 Now we can calculate the profit percentage: Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP) Profit = 118.80 - 36 Profit = 82.80 Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 Profit Percentage = (82.80 / 36) * 100 Profit Percentage = 2.3 * 100 Profit Percentage = 230% So, the retailer's profit percentage is boxed{230%} ."},{"instruction":"the cartesian coordinate system xOy, point P is located at (1, sqrt {3}).

If there are multiple cities with the same maximal population, we can arbitrarily choose any one of them. 2. **Express Population in Terms of Neighboring Cities:**    We know that the population ( M ) of city ( C_{text{max}} ) is the average population of its neighboring cities. Suppose ( C_{text{max}} ) is connected to ( n ) neighboring cities with populations ( p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{n} ). Then we have the equation:    [    M = frac{p_{1} + p_{2} + cdots + p_{n}}{n}    ] 3. **Consider the Inequality:**    Since ( M ) is the maximal population, it must be greater than or equal to any of the populations ( p_{i} ) of the neighboring cities.

This pattern continues for all cities connected to ( C_{text{max}} ). 6. **Connected Network Assumption:**    Given that one can travel from any city to any other city, the entire network of cities is connected.

Find the angle between the diagonals of two faces that share the edge a.","output":"1. **Given:**    We have a rectangular parallelepiped ( ABCD , A_1B_1C_1D_1 ), where:    [    AB = a, quad AD = b, quad AA_1 = c    ] 2. **Vectors in Question:**    - We need to find the angle between the diagonals ( A_1C_1 ) and ( AB_1 ).    - Because ( A_1C_1 parallel AC ), the angle between the diagonals ( A_1C_1 ) and ( AB_1 ) is the same as the angle between ( AC ) and ( AB_1 ). 3. **Identifying Vectors:**    - Let ( vec{AB} = vec{a} ),    - ( vec{AD} = vec{b} ),    - ( vec{AA_1} = vec{c} ).    - Therefore, we have:      [      vec{A_1C_1} = vec{a} + vec{b}, quad vec{AB_1} = vec{a} - vec{c}      ] 4. **Diagonal Lengths:**    - The lengths of the diagonals can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:      [      AC = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, quad AB_1 = sqrt{a^2 + c^2}      ] 5. **Triangle Formed by Points ( A, C, B_1 ):**    By connecting points ( A, C ), and ( B_1 ), we form a triangle with sides:    [    AC = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, quad AB_1 = sqrt{a^2 + c^2}, quad B_1C = sqrt{b^2 + c^2}    ] 6. **Using the Law of Cosines:**    To find the cosine of the included angle ( angle C A B_1 ), use the Law of Cosines:    [    cos angle C A B_1 = frac{AC^2 + AB_1^2 - B_1C^2}{2 cdot AC cdot AB_1}    ]    Substituting the values, we get:    [    cos angle C A B_1 = frac{a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + c^2 - (b^2 + c^2)}{2 sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}    ] 7. **Simplification:**    [    cos angle C A B_1 = frac{a^2 + a^2}{2 sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + c^2)}} = frac{2a^2}{2 sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + c^2)}} = frac{a^2}{sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + c^2)}}    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the angle between the diagonals ( A_1C_1 ) and ( AB_1 ) is given by:    [    boxed{arccos left( frac{a^2}{sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)(a^2 + c^2)}} right)}    ]"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],E={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
