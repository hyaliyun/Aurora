Rain was born as Jung Ji-hoon on June 25, 1982, in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province in South Korea. His mother died in December 2000 as she struggled with diabetes. In the same year, Rain was recruited as a trainee for JYP Entertainment, led by recording artist and producer Park Jin-young. In a CNN interview and also in a Discovery Channel documentary called Discovering Hip Korea, he recalled being repeatedly rejected because of his looks: \\"In fact, I was told after one audition that my singing and dancing was great On his World 2007 tour, his scheduled concerts in Shanghai, Toronto, San Francisco, and Hawaii were canceled, followed by the last concert in Los Angeles. The last event at the Staples Center was canceled only two hours prior to opening: Rain's producer blamed the situation on financial problems of the local promoter, while the local promoter blamed Wellmade STAR M calling them too \\"incompetent to handle the situation\\".  On March 19, 2009, a federal jury in Honolulu found that Rain, his former management agency JYP Entertainment, and two other promotion companies were guilty of breaching a contract and defrauding Honolulu promoter Click Entertainment for 2 million (originally just over 1 million) after the Hawaii concert was canceled and the promoters were not refunded the 500,000 licensing fee. Rain and JYP were ordered to pay 2.4 million each in punitive damages, 1 million for damages related to the fraud, and 2.3 million for breach of contract.  A separate lawsuit filed by promoters Wellmade STAR M was dismissed by a South Korean court on January 28, 2010. Judge Bae Kwang-Kuk ruled in favor of Rain and blamed the plaintiff for poor preparations surrounding the canceled U.S. tour.  In April 2010, Rain and other J. Tune Creative shareholders were accused of embezzling money from the company by a fabric manufacturing company. The company claimed they suffered financial losses. Rain and the shareholders were acquitted of the charges in December of that year. He was re investigated in September 2011 after a discrepancy was found, but was later acquitted again in June 2013.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the place that was transformed into the Town Hall Cinema?  Before the 1760s, Westgate consisted of only a farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited its name from the Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide. During the late 1860s, businessmen developed the area into a seaside resort for the upper to middle-classes. A stretch of sea wall, with promenade on top, was constructed around the beaches at St Mildred's Bay and West Bay, and the land divided into plots to be sold for what would become an exclusive development by the sea for wealthy metropolitan families  within a gated community, rather than for occasional tourists. The opening of a railway station, in 1871, led to the rapid expansion of the population, which reached 2,738 by 1901. The demands of the increasing population led to the building of the parish churches of St. James in 1872 and St. Saviour in 1884. St. Saviour's was designed by the architect C.N. Beazley. In 1884 it was reported that Essex, on the other side of the Thames Estuary, was hit by a tremor so large that it caused the bells of St. James' Church to ring. In 1884, ownership of most of the resort passed to Coutts Bank, after the previous proprietors had gone bankrupt.Around twenty schools were opened during the late 19th century, although many had only a few pupils or closed within a few years. The largest of the schools were Streete Court School, Wellington House Preparatory School and St Michael's School.Wellington House was established in 1886 by two clergymen, the Bull brothers. It closed in 1970 and was demolished in 1972. Notable old boys included Doctor Who actor Jon Pertwee and...

Article: Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury led her to t'ai chi when Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the mysterious Chinese sport.\\"I was active and could not bear resting in bed and I thought I had to find some way to recover,\\"she recalls. She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\\"nice, patient instructor--Nelson\\", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi\\"family\\"-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:\\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man.

His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but should endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\\" Following the master, Oliver now learns to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning , makes kung fu tea for guests and draws ink-wash bamboo paintings. She spends her time outside t'ai chi attending cultural exchange events.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"The conflicts and fears depicted in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" were primarily induced by racial tensions and social changes occurring in the South during the time the novel was written and published. Two significant events that influenced the novel were Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person in 1955, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted as the school's first black students. The novel, set in the mid-1930s but written in the perspective of the 1950s, reflects the conflicts, tensions, and fears surrounding racial issues and the treatment of African Americans during that time. These events and the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro, as described by reviewer Harding LeMay, fueled the racial conflicts and fears portrayed in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today? ?  Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","output":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty, which did not get distribution of reproductions, resides today in the Tate Gallery.

Select from: a). soak in a brine overnight. b). take the chicken, and rub with salt and pepper, let stand for 3 hours....I think the answer is","output":"a). soak in a brine overnight. The correct method to make the chicken juicier before roasting is by soaking it in a brine overnight. A brine is a solution made of water, salt, and sometimes other flavorful ingredients like herbs or sugar. When you soak chicken in a brine, it helps to infuse the chicken with moisture and flavor, making it juicier and more flavorful when roasted. The other method mentioned, b). taking the chicken, and rubbing it with salt and pepper, then letting it stand for 3 hours, will primarily help in seasoning the chicken, not necessarily making it juicier. While this surface level seasoning can contribute to some flavor development, it won't have the same impact on the overall juiciness and moisture retention as brining would."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .  Options: (I) negative. (II) positive.","output":"The sentiment of the following sentence is negative (Option I): \\"Is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors.\\" To understand the sentiment behind the sentence, it is important to break down the adjectives and phrases used: 1. \\"Insultingly\\": This adverb is used to describe something that is offensive or disrespectful. When used to qualify the examination of grief and its effects on the relationships of the survivors, it implies that the examination is not only flawed but also potentially offensive. 2. \\"Inept\\": This adjective refers to a lack of skill, competence, or ability in a certain area. By describing the examination as inept, it further reinforces the negative sentiment, suggesting that the examination is poorly executed and does not offer any valuable or meaningful insights. 3. \\"Artificial\\": This adjective is often used to describe something that is lacking in authenticity, sincerity, or natural quality. When applied to an examination of grief, it suggests that the analysis may be superficial or contrived, rather than genuine or insightful. The combination of these words and the overall tone of the sentence clearly indicates a negative sentiment. The focus on the shortcomings and flaws of the examination of grief and its impacts indicates that the author is dissatisfied with the content and execution of the analysis, leading to the conclusion that the sentiment is negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the thornier aspects","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"the thornier aspects\\" can be perceived as negative, depending on the context in which it is used. The term \\"thorny\\" typically denotes a situation or subject that is particularly difficult, complex, or problematic. Here, it is worth mentioning that sentiment analysis can be subjective, and without additional context, it might be challenging to determine the sentiment accurately. The adjective \\"thorny\\" is often used to describe prickly or spiky plants like thorn bushes; however, when it is symbolically applied to various subjects or situations, it is usually suggestive of a challenging or uncomfortable nature. The word \\"aspects\\" refers to various features, elements, or perspectives of a particular situation or topic. Combining these two words, \\"thornier aspects\\" implies that the situation or matter being discussed involves some complicated, hard-to-solve, or even contentious elements. In most cases, the phrase denotes a sense of negativity or discomfort related to the aspects being referred to precisely because they're tangled or riddled with potential issues that are difficult to navigate. However, given that the provided sentence fragment doesn't offer specific context, one cannot definitively state the sentiment as positive or negative without knowing its relationship with the overall statement. For example, if this sentence is used in a context like, \\"After hours of discussion, the group finally addressed the thornier aspects of the proposed legislation,\\" then the sentiment can be considered negative as it implies challenges or difficulty in the aspects discussed. On the other hand, if the context is along the lines of, \\"The team developed creative solutions for the thornier aspects of the project,\\" the sentiment could be seen as positive, where the thornier aspects were being successfully handled. To conclude, the sentiment of the phrase \\"the thornier aspects\\" is generally negative, primarily due to its association with complexity and difficulty. However, without a clear context and understanding of the subject matter, it is not possible to ascertain the sentiment definitively since it can be influenced by the surrounding phrases or overall nature of the discussion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Context_1 : 20 Years Of Dysfunction is a DVD/CD released in 2005 by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers Of Death. Mainly created by singer Billy Milano, the material for the 2-disc DVD/CD is mostly culled from fan-shot amateur footage. The relative scarceness of available material has resulted in some hilarious decisions by the production team; for instance, \\"Milk\\" is sung by Danny Lilker but the video footage inappropriately shows vocalist Milano singing. Also notable is that the DVD does not include any material from the second Stormtroopers Of Death studio album \\"Bigger Than The Devil\\". Context_2 : Thrash of the Titans was a benefit concert held on August 11, 2001 at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco, CA. The concert was a co-benefit for Testament vocalist Chuck Billy, who was diagnosed with germ cell seminoma (a rare form of cancer); and Chuck Schuldiner, leader of the death metal band Death, who was also battling cancer. The Master of Ceremonies for the evening was S.O.D. vocalist Billy Milano. The concert was organized by Walter Morgan. The show was announced in May 2001, and all 2300 tickets quickly sold out. Context_3 : Biohazard is an American heavy metal band formed in Brooklyn, New York in 1987. They are acknowledged as one of the earliest bands to fuse hardcore punk and heavy metal with elements of hip hop. The earliest lineup consisted of bassist/vocalist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Anthony Meo. Guitarist/vocalist Billy Graziadei would join the band soon after, changing the band to a four-piece. Since February 2016, the lineup has consisted of Billy Graziadei, Bobby Hambel and Danny Schuler. Context_4 : Billy Milano is a Bronx-born heavy metal musician now based in Austin, Texas. He is the singer and - occasionally - guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and he was also the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. He was also the singer of United Forces, which also featured his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. Context_5 : Buffalo was an Australian rock band formed in August 1971 by founding mainstay Dave Tice on lead vocals (ex-Head). Fellow founders, also from Head, were Paul Balbi on drums, John Baxter on guitar, and Peter Wells on bass guitar; together with Alan Milano on lead vocals (ex-Mandala). Milano left after their debut album, \\"Dead Forever...\\" (June 1972), and Balbi was replaced on drums by Jimmy Economou. Their next two albums, \\"Volcanic Rock\\" (July 1973) and \\"Only Want You For Your Body\\" (June 1974), were also issued by Vertigo Records. After 1975 line-up changes resulted in a more commercial sound and the group disbanded in March 1977. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane noted that there was \\"nothing subtle about Buffalo's primal, heavyweight sound, but it was delivered with a great deal of conviction ... combining the dense, occult riffing ... with the progressive blues chops ... the band certainly captured the arrogant disposition of the times in a bold and thunderous fashion\\". Alongside Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs and Blackfeather, Buffalo pioneered Australia's heavy metal, pub rock and alternative rock movements. Peter Wells died on 27 March 2006, aged 58. Context_6 : Daniel A. \\"Dan\\" Lilker (born October 18, 1964 in Bayside, New York) is a musician from the United States, most known as a bass player, but also guitarist, pianist, drummer and vocalist. He is the bassist for the thrash metal band Nuclear Assault and was a founding member of Anthrax with Scott Ian, (Lilker was then playing rhythm guitar) and recorded bass guitar and co-wrote on their first album, \\"Fistful of Metal\\". He also founded crossover band Stormtroopers of Death with Scott Ian and Charlie Benante (from Anthrax), and Billy Milano (Anthrax roadie, M.O.D. singer). He also plays bass with Brutal Truth, Exit-13, Malformed Earthborn, The Ravenous, Overlord Exterminator, Venomous Concept, Crucifist, Nokturnal Hellstorm and Extra Hot Sauce. Context_7 : Something's Gotta Give is the fifth full-length studio album by New York hardcore band, Agnostic Front. It was released in June 1998 on Epitaph Records and follows 1995's \\"Raw Unleashed\\" compilation album. It is actually the first studio album since 1992's \\"One Voice\\". The album was co-produced by Billy Milano, the frontman of crossover thrash bands S.O.D. and M.O.D.. It marks a return to a more hardcore punk style of sound than the thrash metal inspired music of \\"One Voice\\". Backing vocals, amongst others, were provided by Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, and Jimmy Gestapo of Murphy's Law. Context_8 : M.O.D. (abbreviation for Method of Destruction) is a crossover thrash band from New York City, fronted by Stormtroopers of Death vocalist Billy Milano. The band has been around for 31 years (minus one hiatus from 1997 to 2001), and released eight studio albums. With M.O.D., Milano sought to continue on the musical path of the bands Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Nuclear Assault, mixing shades of hardcore punk with thrash metal and often humorous and politically incorrect lyrics. Context_9 : Zoetrope was an American heavy metal band from Chicago, Illinois. Although their sound was akin to thrash metal, the group described themselves as \\"Street Metal\\". The group was formed in 1976 by teenage friends Barry Stern (drums/vocals), Kevin Michael Rasofsky, aka Kevin Michael, (guitar), and Calvin \\"Willis\\" Humphrey (bass), soon to be joined by second guitarist Ken Black. Initially playing covers, the band soon ventured into writing their own material and released a single in 1980. Although undeniably a metal band, Zoetrope was also active in Chicago's hardcore punk scene, sharing bills with locals hardcore bands and hanging out at O'Banions, a Chicago punk bar (Ken Black and Barry Stern also produced the self-titled LP by Chicago-based hardcore band Life Sentence in 1986). Following the release of a couple of demo tapes, the group was signed to Combat Records and issued their first LP, \\"Amnesty\\", in 1985. In 1987, the band traveled to Los Angeles to record their follow up, \\"A Life of Crime\\", with producer Randy Burns (Megadeth, Nuclear Assault). During the recording sessions, Ken Black left the band and returned to Chicago to sort out substance abuse issues. He was replaced by Louis Svitek. Although Svitek appears on the album's cover, Kevin Michael later confirmed that Ken Black had finished his guitar parts before leaving Los Angeles. During the tour supporting \\"A Life of Crime\\", Svitek was recruited for M.O.D. by Billy Milano. After the tour, Barry Stern jumped ship to fellow Chicagoans Trouble. Kevin Michael eventually returned with a new line up for 1993's \\"Mind Over Splatter\\" but the band folded for good soon after. Context_10 : Stormtroopers of Death (also known as S.O.D.) were an American crossover thrash band formed in New York City in 1985. They are credited as being among the first bands to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal into a style sometimes referred to as crossover thrash. The band is also known for reuniting Anthrax members Scott Ian (guitars) and Charlie Benante (drums) with their former bassist Dan Lilker. The song \\"Milano Mosh\\" from their 1985 debut album, \\"Speak English or Die\\", was the \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" intro anthem for many years. fact_1 : M.O.D.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What non-native plant species are considered noxious? from the following article ?  Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose album changed perceived notions about the number of successful singles that could be taken from one album? ?  Blender described Jackson as the \\"late 20th century's preeminent pop icon\\", while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a \\"musical phenomenon\\" and that \\"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\\". Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\".

Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation?

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph. The princesses have adventurous and free-spirited natures that are viewed as \\"unladylike\\" and \\"non-proper\\" by other members of the royal society. This leads King Randolph to summon his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to the castle to help raise the princesses. Unbeknownst to King Randolph, Rowena plans to poison him and get rid of his daughters so that she can become queen. Attempting to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena makes their lives miserable by stripping the castle of everything they love,  making them wear grey dresses and banishing singing and dancing. The princesses find comfort in their late mother's favorite story, which tells of a magical kingdom where golden flowers grant wishes and princesses can dance at an enchanted pavilion for three nights. The princesses realize that the story contains clues on how to enter the magical kingdom from their own bedroom, by dancing on specific stones on the floor from oldest to youngest. Now inside the magical kingdom, the princesses discover that the water there possesses healing properties. The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn through, arousing her suspicion. The royal cobbler and Genevieve's love interest, Derek, comes to fix their shoes and sees that they are covered in gold dust. When King Randolph mysteriously falls ill, Genevieve is prompted to ask Derek to investigate Rowena's true intentions. That night, the princesses return to the magical kingdom to dance. During this time, Derek discovers that Rowena is stealing heirlooms from the castle and dealing with an apothecary, and he rushes back to the castle. Answer:","output":"In the given context, King Randolph is planned to be poisoned by his cousin, Duchess Rowena. Unaware of her malicious intent, King Randolph invites Rowena to the castle to help raise his twelve princess daughters, who possess adventurous and free-spirited natures that are disapproved of by the royal society.  Rowena has a hidden agenda—to poison King Randolph and eliminate his daughters, ultimately allowing her to seize the throne and become queen. In an effort to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena takes away the things they cherish and imposes strict and joyless rules upon them. Despite these challenges, the princesses find solace in their late mother's favorite story, which leads them to a magical kingdom where they can temporarily escape their dismal reality. While Rowena's scheme is unfolding, the royal cobbler Derek (who is also Genevieve's love interest) becomes involved in the story when he notices that the princesses' dancing shoes are covered in gold dust, a clue to their adventures in the magical kingdom. As King Randolph suddenly falls ill, Genevieve suspects foul play and asks Derek to further investigate Rowena's true intentions. During the princesses' visit to the magical kingdom, Derek uncovers evidence that Rowena is not only stealing precious heirlooms from the castle but is also in league with an apothecary. It becomes clear that Rowena is responsible for King Randolph's mysterious illness, and that her ultimate goal is to poison the king and dispose of his daughters to seize power. Thus, Derek's timely intervention and the strong bond among the princesses become crucial in thwarting Rowena's nefarious plans and saving their family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ultimate goal is living within your financial means, both short- and long-term. Pay attention to the ways you’re spending money.  Perhaps the most important aspect of preparing yourself to become financially independent is ensuring that you are not spending more than you’re making.  Fortunately, there are several methods to track your spending:  Use a ledger or a spreadsheet.  The manual approach is great way to start, as it makes you keenly aware of every expense.  Whatever you use, the act of entering every expense into a database of your expenses will keep you better informed of your own spending patterns. Use free accounting software. Once you have multiple bank accounts, and different types of income and expenditures, your ability to organize the corresponding information may demand more than your spreadsheet skills can handle.  Online platforms such as Personal Capital and Mint are free and immensely helpful.  For more specific advice, see How to Manage Your Money Wisely. With an eye towards making immediate improvements in your financial behavior, evaluate how you spend most of your money. There are everyday expenses many people often overlook that can hamper your ability to live within your financial means.  Because a handful of expenses consume most of your budget, pursue these first and minimize common types of spending.  Minimize rent or mortgage payments. Choose your home based on the cost of living in the area.  Go for as little home as you’re comfortable in — both when buying or renting. Consider purchasing a duplex and renting out one side or renting out rooms in your home. Reduce your reliance on vehicles.  Vehicles not only diminish the quality of our environment, they are also associated with substantial financial costs.  Walking, biking, and taking the bus will reduce your spending immediately. Clothing, food, and leisure are areas in which many people spend far more than is appropriate, given their income. Remember that even everyday decisions regarding your method of transportation or eating habits can be the difference between overspending and being able to begin saving for financial independence.   Buy what you can used. Thrift stores and craigslist offer high quality items for only a fraction of what they would cost new. Do it yourself. From home repair to vegetable gardening, you can save money (and increase your worldly wisdom) by taking matters into your own hands.  There’s also an undeniable sense of satisfaction fixing something yourself or growing the ingredients to make yourself a salad from your own yard. Understand that debt does not necessarily prevent you from becoming financially independent. Also recognize that you don’t need to pay it off as quickly as possible. Pay off debt steadily, but within your ability to do so while achieving financial stability. Most importantly, do not take on unnecessary debts.  When paying off debt, start with high-interest debt, like credit cards and auto loans, before paying off student loans. Don’t take on new debt.  Your education is a reasonable expense to take out loans for, as it is an investment in yourself.  Even a car loan can be justifiable if it is the only way you can afford to buy a vehicle.  Continually increasingly credit card debt, however, is blatantly irresponsible. Not only is taking on new debt a clear sign that you are not living within your means, continually acquiring debt will ensure that you are unable to achieve financial independence.  Never finance a vacation, new clothes, or even unnecessary food purchases with a credit card. A good rule to follow: only take on debt for investments, not for lifestyle.

He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomulka's thaw\\". Context: Wladyslaw Gomulka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Wladyslaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomulka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Wladyslaw's older sister Jozefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Wladyslaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Wladyslaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region.  Gomulka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomulka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor.  In 1922, Gomulka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. The re-established Polish state of Gomulka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Sila (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomulka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomulka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomulka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. Question: Where was he born?. Whats the answer?","output":"Wladyslaw Gomulka was born in a village called Bialobrzegi Franciszkanskie, which is on the outskirts of Krosno, in the region of Galicia.

Wilhelm Richard Wagner (; German: ['RicaRt 'va:gna] In 1833, Wagner's brother Albert managed to obtain for him a position as choir master at the theatre in Wurzburg. In the same year, at the age of 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, Die Feen (The Fairies). This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half a century later, when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer's death in 1883.  Having returned to Leipzig in 1834, Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in Magdeburg during which he wrote Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love), based on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure. This was staged at Magdeburg in 1836 but closed before the second performance; this, together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him, left the composer in bankruptcy. Wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at Magdeburg, the actress Christine Wilhelmine \\"Minna\\" Planer and after the disaster of Das Liebesverbot he followed her to Konigsberg, where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre. The two married in Tragheim Church on 24 November 1836. In May 1837, Minna left Wagner for another man, and this was but only the first debacle of a tempestuous marriage. In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga (then in the Russian Empire), where he became music director of the local opera; having in this capacity engaged Minna's sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838.  By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga on the run from creditors. Debts would plague Wagner for most of his life. Initially they took a stormy sea passage to London, from which Wagner drew the inspiration for his opera Der fliegende Hollander (The Flying Dutchman), with a plot based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine. The Wagners settled in Paris in September 1839 and stayed there until 1842. Wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as A pilgrimage to Beethoven, which sketched his growing concept of \\"music drama\\", and An end in Paris, where he depicts his own miseries as a German musician in the French metropolis. He also provided arrangements of operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the Schlesinger publishing house. During this stay he completed his third and fourth operas Rienzi and Der fliegende Hollander.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What kind of pieces did Wagner start out writing?","output":"In the provided text, it states that Wagner \\"composed his first complete opera, Die Feen (The Fairies)\\" at the age of 20.

Born Millicent Lilian Entwistle in Wales on February 5, 1908, she was a British stage actress with aspirations of stardom. She dreamed of making a name for herself in the film industry in Hollywood during the 1920s and 1930s. Peg Entwistle began her acting career in New York, performing in various Broadway plays; her most significant role was in the running play titled \\"Tommy\\" in 1925. Despite her accolades, she moved to Los Angeles in 1932 in hopes of launching a successful film career. Her decision to move west came after a series of personal struggles, including her husband, fellow actor Robert Keith, divorcing her, which left her heartbroken and desperate for a fresh start. Living in Los Angeles with her uncle, she finally landed a role in RKO Studio's film \\"Thirteen Women.\\" Sadly, the critics' harsh reviews for the film and her role in it were devastating to her confidence and stirred feelings of failure. Moreover, it was during the Great Depression, which made it challenging for aspiring actors to find work in the already competitive Hollywood scene. On the night of September 16, 1932, the 24-year-old actress climbed the steep terrain of Mount Lee to the Hollywoodland sign (as it read then) and scaled a workman's ladder to the top of the letter \\"H.\\" She then took off her coat, folded it, placed her purse that also contained her suicide note, and leaped to her death. Peg's body was found by a passerby two days later, and her cause of death was officially declared a suicide. The media extensively covered her tragic story, turning her into somewhat of a symbol of the shattered dreams of aspiring actors. Though Peg Entwistle's life was short and marred by darkness, it's essential to recall that she was a talented actress who had shown promise in her work in both theater and film. Peg's story serves as a reminder of the hardships and heartbreak many actors face in their quest for success in the film industry, as well as the importance of mental health awareness and the need to support those struggling with depression and feelings of failure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tyler was born Liv Rundgren at Mount Sinai Hospital in East Harlem, New York. She is the only daughter of Bebe Buell, a model, singer, and former Playboy Playmate (Miss November 1974), and Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith. Her mother named her after Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, after seeing Ullmann on the cover of the March 5, 1977 issue of TV Guide. She is of Italian, German, Polish, English and African American ancestry on her father's side and German ancestry on her mother's side. In 2001, Tyler played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's. In discussion of the role, she said it was \\"definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection.\\"  In 2001, she starred in the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undomiel. The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane. She learned to speak the fictitious Elvish language that was created by Tolkien. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted that Tyler's performance was \\"lovely and earnest\\".  A year later, Tyler again starred as Arwen in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews. She spent months learning sword fighting to be used during the concluding battle scenes in The Two Towers, but her scenes were removed after the script was changed. The film was an enormous box office success, earning over 926 million worldwide, out-grossing its predecessor, which earned over 871 million. In 2003, Tyler featured in the third and last installment of the series, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  Following the success of The Lord of the Rings, she appeared opposite her Armageddon co-star Ben Affleck in writer-director Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Jersey Girl (2004), playing a woman who meets a widowed father played by Affleck, re-opening his heart to love. In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt \\"scared and vulnerable\\" while filming Jersey Girl, adding \\"I was so used to those other elements of the character [Arwen]. On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue.\\" However, she reiterated that doing Jersey Girl was what she wanted to do.  In 2005, she appeared in Steve Buscemi's independent drama Lonesome Jim, where she was cast alongside Casey Affleck, as a single mother and nurse who reconnects with an old fling who has returned to their small town in Indiana after a failed run as a novelist in New York. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize. Her next appearance in film was in a supporting role as an insightful therapist who tries to help a once-successful dentist (Adam Sandler) cope with the loss of his family in the September 11th attacks in Reign Over Me (2007).

Given the following context:  The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. It is here that the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of AT&T Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco, and where the new Warriors arena will be built.West of downtown, across Van Ness Avenue, lies the large Western Addition neighborhood, which became established with a large African American population after World War II. The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley, the Fillmore, and Japantown, which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II. The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact, including the famous \\"Painted Ladies\\", standing alongside Alamo Square.

Feel around the root with your hands and look for noticeable spots of rot. Peeled ginger will darken around the edges when it starts to go bad. Cut off the ends of the root with a sharp chef’s knife. Cutting a little off of each side will make it easier to hold the ginger rather than working with an irregular shape. Try to only cut off a small portion from the edges so you do not waste any of the usable ginger. Stand the ginger on one of its ends, and use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the rest of the skin. Slice in a downward motion towards the cutting board. Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible. Alternatively, you can use the edge of a spoon to scrape the peel off of fresh ginger. This works especially well on the rounded knobs that may be difficult to reach with a knife. Peeled ginger should be stored in a freezer-safe resealable bag and keeps for 1 week. Frozen ginger is easier to grate since it hardens up.  Unpeeled ginger keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months. Allow it time to thaw before peeling it.  Peeled ginger can be grated as soon as it’s pulled out from the freezer.","output":"Ensure ginger is solid and free of soft spots or rot. Cut off the ends to make it easier to hold.

They had been enjoying a typical girls' night out, wandering through the vibrant downtown streets, laughing and gossiping about the events of the week. But that all changed when the man, who had been eerily stalking them since they left the pub, finally approached them. His once harmless expression had morphed into a menacing scowl as he brandished his firearm. The metallic glint of the pistol glared menacingly at Felicia, forcing her to swallow her fear and take control of the situation. She glanced at Laura, noticing the panic invading her friend's eyes, and sent her a reassuring nod, trying to channel some of the courage she didn't know she possessed. \\"Alright, just stay calm,\\" Felicia said evenly, maintaining eye contact with the stranger. \\"What do you want?\\" The gun-wielding man looked at her with a sinister grin, clearly enjoying the power he held over the two young women. \\"You will give me your wallets, phones, and any jewelry you have on,\\" he spat, his voice tinged with malice. As the girls began to nervously comply with his demands, Felicia's mind raced to find a way out of this dreadful situation. She noticed a small crowd forming nearby, as curious onlookers slowly discovered the unfolding drama. Felicia looked back to the man and said, \\"Okay, we'll give you what you want, just please don't hurt us.\\" As they handed over their belongings, Laura discreetly caught the eye of a man standing not too far from the scene, signaling for help. The observer nodded subtly and slipped away, presumably to call the police.

Felicia realized they needed to maintain control of the situation even if it meant prolonging their torment.

They began walking towards the alley, their minds working in tandem to prolong the journey. Laura pretended to trip, falling to the ground dramatically. The gunman grew impatient and yanked her to her feet, but Felicia noticed his grip on the weapon had weakened ever so slightly. Still edging towards the alley, Felicia accidentally bumped into a stack of empty cans, sending them crashing to the ground and causing a racket that attracted the attention of even more bystanders. The gunman was getting increasingly agitated, sensing that his time was running out. He raised the gun once more, his hand shaking slightly. \\"One more slip-up and I swear I'll –\\" His threat was interrupted by the sound of sirens approaching in the distance. Panic flashed across his face, quickly replaced by a snarl of anger. \\"You think you're so smart, don't you?\\" Suddenly, Felicia saw her opportunity. She mustered all the strength she could and threw her leg up, connecting with the man's hand in a swift, solid kick. The gun flew from his grip, skittering across the pavement and out of reach. Without wasting a moment, Felicia and Laura sprinted towards the crowd that had just begun to disperse at the sound of the gun. The frenzied thief was hot on their heels, his rage fueling his impulsive pursuit. As they reached the crowd, the approaching police intercepted the pursuing man, tackling him to the ground with a cacophony of shouts and struggling limbs. Felicia and Laura collapsed against a nearby wall, their hearts pounding even louder than the sirens that now filled the air. They embraced each other tightly, their fingers digging into each other's skin in a desperate bid for grounding. Together they had faced their nightmare and had come out the other side stronger, more united than ever before. And as they looked at each other, tears of relief streaming down their cheeks, they knew that they would never again take their bond for granted, grateful for one another's presence in their darkest hour."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the rule who suceeded the leader that defeated the Persian Emperor Shapur 1?  Palmyra (; Palmyrene:  Tadmor; Arabic: تَدْمُر‎ Tadmur) is an ancient Semitic city in present-day Homs Governorate, Syria. Archaeological finds date back to the Neolithic period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the Roman Empire in the first century AD. The city grew wealthy from trade caravans; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the Silk Road and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the Great Colonnade, the Temple of Bel, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of Amorites, Arameans, and Arabs. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke Palmyrene (a dialect of Aramaic), while using Greek for commercial and diplomatic purposes. Greco-Roman culture influenced the culture of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped local Semitic deities, Mesopotamian and Arab gods. By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to Islam in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic. Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman province of Syria, having its political organization influenced by the Greek city-state model during the first two centuries AD.

Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world.

Yes or no. A:","output":"While the answer you found on Google refers to the commercial production and administration of vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters (such as retinyl acetate or palmitate), it does not directly answer what Vitamin A is for. Let me provide you with a detailed answer. Vitamin A is a group of fat-soluble organic compounds that are essential for various bodily functions. The two main forms of vitamin A are preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified forms, like retinyl acetate or palmitate) and provitamin A carotenoids (largely beta carotene), which can be converted to active retinol in the body. Vitamin A has several crucial functions, including: 1. Vision - Vitamin A (particularly its derivative, retinal) is a vital component of the light-sensitive proteins called rhodopsin and iodopsin in the retina, enabling proper light perception and color vision. 2. Immune system - Vitamin A maintains the integrity of epithelial cells, which serve as the body's first line of defense against infections. It also supports the production and functioning of various immune cells. 3. Growth and reproduction - Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and development, including embryonic development. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other vital organs. 4. Cell differentiation and gene expression - As a component of retinoic acid, vitamin A modulates the expression of genes and regulates the differentiation of various cell types. In summary, Vitamin A plays a vital role in maintaining healthy vision, supporting the immune system, enabling proper growth and reproduction, and regulating cell differentiation and gene expression.

The match at the Mercedes-Benz Arena showcased the strength of Hull as they battled against Stuttgart, who couldn't find a way to overcome Bruce's well-prepared and disciplined team. Hull made a bright start to the game, with David Meyler capitalizing on some lapse goalkeeping to slot in a goal, giving the visitors an early lead. The excitement continued when Andy Robertson made his debut mark on the team, firing a clever finish from a tight angle and effectively doubling Hull's lead in the 12th minute. His goal solidified Hull's dominance in the match, and they looked to be in control as they weathered Stuttgart's attacks. However, Stuttgart was not willing to go down without a fight. Vedad Ibisevic, a Bosnia-Herzegovina international, managed to put his team on the scoreboard just before the break with a powerful shot from 20 yards out. This goal came after Hull's goalkeeper, Steve Harper, made an impressive save to keep out a penalty attempt from Ibisevic towards the end of the half. Despite Ibisevic's efforts, Hull maintained their composure and continued to dominate the match, showing that they were not to be intimidated by their Bundesliga opponents. They could have potentially extended their lead further, but in the end, Hull emerged victorious. The result allowed Steve Bruce's side to finish their pre-season games on a high note, with an unbeaten streak that undoubtedly boosted the team's morale going into the new season. The impressive performance against Stuttgart not only showcased the potential and skill in Bruce's squad but also demonstrated that Hull was more than capable of holding their own against tough opponents. This strong showing also must have instilled a sense of pride and confidence in Hull's management, players, and fan base as they prepared to enter the competitive fray of the Premier League."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article:","output":"Title: Why the House of Representatives Won't Impeach the President Once upon a time, in a big, important building called the House of Representatives, some people thought about trying to remove the President from his job. This is called \\"impeachment.\\" But a man named Boehner, who talks to reporters, said \\"No, we're not going to try that.\\"  Boehner thinks that talking about impeachment is like saying \\"Boo!\\" during a game of tag to make other people run away. He believes that the White House, where the President lives and works, is using this big word - impeachment - to help their friends, the Democrats, win a big contest in November. The winners of this contest get to make a lot of decisions for the country. Some people called \\"Tea Party Republicans\\" want to see the President get in trouble. They have been hoping that the people in the big building, the House of Representatives, will have the courage to try to remove him from his job. But, it's not so easy, because there's another big, important building called the US Senate. The US Senate is kind of like a big brother to the House of Representatives. They have to agree on a lot of things for big decisions to happen. If the House of Representatives wants to remove the President, the US Senate has to say \\"okay\\" and then everyone will have to agree that the President did something very, very bad.  But the big brother, the US Senate, is full of people called Democrats. Democrats are friends with the President, so they don't want to see him get in trouble. That's why, when the House of Representatives thinks about trying to remove the President, it doesn't look like it will happen. So, as of now, it seems like the President doesn't have to worry about getting in trouble, because the House of Representatives doesn't want to try the big move. And so, in this big game of tag, no one is shouting \\"Boo!\\" at the moment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are these paraphrases? He was born in 1951 in Mauritius ( Quatre Bornes ) and died in 2002 . He was born in Quatre Bornes in Mauritius in 1951 and died in 2002 .","output":"Yes, these sentences are paraphrases of each other. Both sentences convey the same information, which is that a person was born in Quatre Bornes, Mauritius in 1951 and died in 2002. Although the word order and structure of the sentences differ slightly, the meaning remains consistent between the two. Paraphrasing is a technique used to present information in a different way while retaining its original meaning, and these examples are a clear demonstration of this concept at work.  The first sentence reads, \\"He was born in 1951 in Mauritius (Quatre Bornes) and died in 2002.\\" The chronological order of the events (birth and death) are presented in this sentence, with the specific location of the birth (Quatre Bornes, Mauritius) indicated in brackets. This arrangement highlights the birth year and country, while the city in which the person was born appears as additional information. Conversely, the second sentence reads, \\"He was born in Quatre Bornes in Mauritius in 1951 and died in 2002.\\" In this rephrasing, the city and country of birth are presented as two separate pieces of information before the birth year is mentioned. This arrangement emphasizes the location and provides the reader with the city first and then the country, creating a smoother geographic transition. Both sentences successfully convey the birth and death details of the person in question, albeit with slightly different emphases and textual flow. This demonstrates the power and flexibility of paraphrasing as a technique in writing and communication."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B.  But I can use this background: Collision theory tells us that molecules need to collide in order for a reaction to take place. All else being equal, anything that increases the frequency of collisions would also increase the rate of reaction. One way to do this is to increase the concentrations of one or more of the reactants. Using a real world example, a busy freeway will experience much more frequent car collisions than a fairly empty neighborhood street. Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products.  What is an answer for this question: Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and considering the principles of collision theory, case B, where higher concentrations of reactants are used, would have a higher rate of reaction compared to case A with lower reactant concentrations. Collision theory states that for a reaction to occur, the reactant molecules must collide with a specific orientation and with sufficient energy. The probability and frequency of these effective collisions depend on the concentrations of the reactants involved. In case B, the higher concentration of reactants provides more molecules per unit volume, thus increasing the likelihood of these molecules colliding with one another. As a result, there would be a higher number of effective collisions over a given period of time, which translates to a higher rate of reaction. On the other hand, case A has a lower concentration of reactants. Consequently, there are fewer reactant molecules per unit volume, and the frequency of effective collisions is reduced compared to case B. This leads to a lower rate of reaction due to the decreased number of opportunities for reactant molecules to collide and transform into products. To summarize, case B, with its higher concentration of reactants, experiences a higher rate of reaction than case A due to the increased frequency of effective collisions as guided by the collision theory."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I repeatedly see people asking advice on forums as to which is the best detox to do. Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing. Before I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary. Why detoxes don't work Firstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies. I read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \\"shining glory\\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How did Veet convince Chinese women that any body hair was unsightly? Options:  A. releasing studies on the dangers of body hair  B. not enough information  C. ads using hairless models  D. releasing ads equating hairless skin with health and confidence Answer:","output":"D. releasing ads equating hairless skin with health and confidence"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Silence might even be misinterpreted as being detached or uninterested in the conversation, which could exacerbate any existing tension or awkwardness. On the other hand, option b) \\"I told a joke\\" is more likely to achieve the intended goal of lightening the mood. Sharing a joke or funny story introduces humor into the conversation, which can help in several ways: 1. Encouraging laughter: Laughter is a psychologically and physically beneficial response that can reduce stress, promote relaxation, and create a positive atmosphere. 2. Building rapport: Jokes can create common ground between people, helping them relate to one another and foster a sense of camaraderie. 3. Breaking tension: A well-placed joke can diffuse tension or awkwardness in a conversation, making everyone feel more at ease. 4. Changing focus: If the conversation had gotten heavy or drifted into an uncomfortable topic, a joke can help steer the discussion back to a lighter and more enjoyable subject. It is essential, however, to tell an appropriate joke that will not offend or alienate anyone in the conversation. A well-chosen, uncontroversial joke can effectively lighten the mood, while an offensive or inappropriate one could have the opposite effect. In conclusion, if your goal is to lighten the mood of the conversation, it is best to opt for telling a joke (option b). By doing so, you can potentially create laughter, build rapport, break tension, and change focus, contributing to a happier and more relaxed atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: The Viking Adventure is open to visitors every day of the week. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. To break it down, let's first look at the premise and its details: 1. Wood Quay is the location of the original Viking settlement and The Viking Adventure. 2. The Viking Adventure's operating days and hours are Tuesday to Saturday from 10am to 4:30pm, and it is closed on both Sunday and Monday. Now let's look at the hypothesis which states that The Viking Adventure is open to visitors every day of the week. Logically, if we compare the hypothesis to the details in the premise, we can see that there is a contradiction regarding the opening days and hours of The Viking Adventure. According to the premise, The Viking Adventure is closed on Sundays and Mondays, which means it is not open every day of the week. So, the hypothesis does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true since it contradicts the information given in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Profits were boosted by the use of new fuel efficient aircraft and what it called a \\"remarkable\\" turnaround at Spanish airline Iberia. IAG's operating profits nearly doubled to just more than €1bn. It also raised its 2015 forecast by 20%. Since the formation of IAG through the merger of BA and Iberia in 2011, Iberia has been undergoing a massive restructuring programme, with jobs and salaries being cut. Last year, Iberia made a further 1,427 redundancies following negotiations with trade unions in Spain, taking the total number of job cuts in recent years to 4,500. But the airline reported an operating profit of €50m, compared with an operating loss of €166m last year. Mr Walsh called Iberia's turnaround \\"remarkable, both financially and operationally\\" adding he was \\"very proud of its achievement especially its strong cost discipline\\". \\"In 2013 we said our intention was for Iberia to break even in 2014 and it has fulfilled that promise,\\" he added. He added he expected Iberia to continue to improve its profitability given the trajectory that it is on. \\"The performance to date for Iberia has been tremendous and we expect that to continue in 2015,\\" he said. Shares in IAG rose almost 5% to 586.50p on the London Stock Exchange. In addition to BA and Iberia, IAG also owns Spanish low-cost airline Vueling. IAG said all three of its airlines faced very competitive markets domestically and across Europe from \\"the growing presence of low-cost carriers\\". BA reported an operating profit of €1.2bn, up from €762m a year earlier, which IAG said showed \\"significant progress towards its long-term targets\\". Vueling reported a slight rise in annual operating profits to €141m. It increased capacity by 24% and added new bases in Brussels and Rome. Last month, IAG launched a €1.36bn takeover bid for Irish airline Aer Lingus, but it gave no further details on the progress of the takeover in its results statement. The Irish government, which holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus, is believed to have concerns over the deal and trades unions have warned over jobs cuts. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, told the BBC: \\"We'll have discussions in due course with the Irish government. \\"I'm very much focused on the fantastic results that we've announced today and looking forward to developing IAG with the existing airlines and with opportunities to expand with other airlines.\\" Summary:","output":"IAG, the company that owns British Airways and Iberia, made a lot of money last year because they used more fuel-efficient airplanes and improved their business, especially at Iberia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

He was proficient in playing both the upright bass and the guitar and was a capable singer, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to Muddy Waters, Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the post-World War II sound of the Chicago blues. Dixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. Dixon signed with Chess Records as a recording artist, but he began performing less, being more involved with administrative tasks for the label. By 1951, he was a full-time employee at Chess, where he acted as producer, talent scout, session musician and staff songwriter. He was also a producer for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records. His relationship with Chess was sometimes strained, but he stayed with the label from 1948 to the early 1960s. During this time Dixon's output and influence were prodigious. From late 1956 to early 1959, he worked in a similar capacity for Cobra Records, for which he produced early singles for Otis Rush, Magic Sam, and Buddy Guy. He later recorded for Bluesville Records. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, Dixon ran his own record label, Yambo Records, and two subsidiary labels, Supreme and Spoonful. He released his 1971 album, Peace?, on Yambo and also singles by McKinley Mitchell, Lucky Peterson and others.  Dixon is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues. He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Joe Louis Walker, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, Jimmy Rogers, Sam Lay and others.  In December 1964, the Rolling Stones reached number one on the UK Singles Chart with their cover of Dixon's \\"Little Red Rooster\\". In the same year, the group also covered \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" on their debut album, The Rolling Stones.

Please answer a question about the following article about Napoleon: Alexander faced pressure from his brother, Duke Constantine, to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia, and hand over the Ionian Islands to France. By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia. He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days. What was the name of the new kingdom Napoleon created from Prussian territories?","output":"The name of the new kingdom that Napoleon created from Prussian territories was Westphalia. He formed this kingdom by wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map as part of the harsh peace terms for Prussia following the Treaties of Tilsit. Napoleon then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of the Kingdom of Westphalia. This humiliating treatment of Prussia led to a deep and bitter antagonism that festered as the Napoleonic era progressed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Whether the relationship continues or not, you have to move on with your life. You can acknowledge that you made a mistake (and you should). You can also regret that mistake and learn from it. You do, however, have to accept your actions. This means looking at the good and the bad that they have caused and being at peace with yourself.. Cheating is more than just the company of someone outside your exclusive relationship. Cheating is dishonesty. You have to start being honest about your needs and desires, both with yourself and your partner. There is no way to address your needs if you deny them or do not communicate them to your partner. You should leave your partner plenty of space to be mad at you. They deserve that. You should not be a punching bag - physically or emotionally. Your cheating is not leverage for your partner to control you or abuse you. Set boundaries as to what is okay and not okay when it comes to how you treat each other. You have to move on with your life and, if your partner agrees, your relationship. If you genuinely cannot help but cheat, then your needs are not being met in some way or you do not need a monogamous relationship. That might mean you need to discuss them with your partner, or maybe you need to see a counselor to help you through personal problems. Either way, you have to be able to trust yourself.

Patent Application Publication Act of 1995 - Requires each patent application, except applications for design patents and provisional applications, to be published as soon as possible after 18 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought, except for an application that is no longer pending or one subject to a secrecy order.  Permits earlier publication at the applicant's request. Prohibits disclosure of information concerning published applications except as determined by the Commissioner of Patents.  Prohibits, upon request by certain independent inventors, the publication of rejected applications, with specified exceptions, until three months after the Commissioner notifies the applicant.  Requires the applicant to certify that no application was or will be filed for the invention in a foreign country.  Entitles a patent application to claim the benefit of an earlier filing date in a foreign country if a claim therefor and a certified copy of the original foreign application, specification, and drawings upon which it is based are filed in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) at any such time during the pendency of the application as is required by the Commissioner.  Allows the Commissioner to consider the failure of the applicant to file a timely claim for priority as a waiver of any such claim.  Authorizes the Commissioner to determine the time period within which an amendment containing the specific reference to an earlier filed application shall be submitted.  Specifies that a patent shall include the right to obtain a reasonable royalty from any person who, during the period from publication of the application until issue of the patent:  (1) makes, uses, or sells in the United States the invention as claimed in the published application or imports such an invention into the United States, or if the invention as claimed in the published application is a process, uses or sells in or imports into the United States products made by that process as claimed in such application; and (2) had actual notice or knowledge of the published patent application.  Makes the right to obtain a reasonable royalty unavailable unless the invention claimed in the patent is identical to that claimed in the published application.  Specifies the commencement date of the period for obtaining a royalty based upon the international publication of an international application designating the United States.  Revises Federal patent law to provide that a person shall not be entitled to a patent if the invention was described in a published patent application by another filed in the United States, or in a published international application, before the invention thereof by the applicant.  Directs the Commissioner to recover the cost of early publication by adjusting the filing, issue, and maintenance fees by charging a separate publication fee, or by any combination of such fees.  Provides for the extension of the term of a patent the issue which is delayed due to an unusual administrative delay by the PTO.  Limits the total duration of all extensions to ten years.  Reduces the extension period equal to the time during the processing or examination of the application leading to the patent in which the applicant failed to engage in reasonable efforts (current law provides a reduction for lack of due diligence) to conclude processing or examination of the application.  Prohibits the extension of a patent the term of which has been disclaimed beyond the expiration date of the disclaimer.

With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections.

In etymology, the \\"cognate\\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \\"cognate\\" derives from the Latin noun \\"cognatus\\", which means \\"blood relative\\".  - Mount Passaconaway is a mountain in the Sandwich Range Wilderness of the White Mountain National Forest near the eastern boundary of Waterville Valley . It is named after Passaconaway , a 16th - century sachem of the Pennacook tribe , whose name was also attached to a small village in Albany , where the northern trailhead is now located . It is ranked 42d in elevation on the list of 48 White Mountains four - thousand footers . On the original 1931 list of 4000 - footers , it was ranked 26th , with an elevation of 4,116 feet , although the 1931 topographic map shows it as 4,060 feet . The 1987 USGS topographic map indicates it is 4,043 , while the elevation recorded in the USGS Geographic Names Information System is 4,019 ft. The thickly wooded , unmarked summit may be approached from trailheads to the north ( on the Kancamagus Highway ) or from Wonalancet to the south . Old maps show a \`\` Passaconaway Lodge '' or \`\` shelter '' on the southeast aspect of the mountain , and the 4,000 - footer guidebook mentions that it was built in 1891 . It was rebuilt several times , evolving into the Wonalancet Out Door Club 's Camp Rich . After its collapse in 2000 it was removed , consistent with Wilderness regulations .  - A sachem or sagamore is a paramount chief among the Algonquians or other Native American tribes of the northeast. The two words are anglicizations of cognate terms (c.1622) from different Eastern Algonquian languages. Some sources contend the sagamore was a lesser chief than the sachem.  - The Weeks Act is a federal law (36 Stat. 961) enacted by the United States Congress on March 1, 1911. Introduced by Massachusetts Congressman John W. Weeks and signed into law by President William Howard Taft, the law authorized the US Secretary of Agriculture to \\"Examine, locate and recommend for purchase ... such lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as ... may be necessary to the regulation of flow of navigable streams...\\" This meant that the federal government would be able to purchase private land if the purchase was deemed necessary to protect rivers' and watersheds' headwaters in the eastern United States. Furthermore, the law allowed for land acquired through this act to be preserved and maintained as national forest territory. Six years earlier, the Transfer Act of 1905 transferred control over the federal forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture and its Forest Service. Responsibility for land purchased through the Weeks Act was not given to former Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot because he resigned in 1907, with the stipulation that he would only resign if he could appoint his successor. This stipulation led to the Forest Service's tradition of picking a head with forestry knowledge. With the land acquired through the Weeks Act, Pinchot's successor obtained the power to issue permits for water power development on National Forests. The Weeks Act appropriated 9 million to purchase 6 million acres (24,000 km) of land in the eastern United States.  - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade.  - The Merrimack River (or Merrimac River, an occasional earlier spelling) is a river in the northeastern United States. It rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin, New Hampshire, flows southward into Massachusetts, and then flows northeast until it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport. From Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, Massachusetts, onward, the MassachusettsNew Hampshire border is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river.  - A paramount chief is the English language designation for the highest-level political leader in a regional or local polity or country administered politically with a chief-based system. This term is used occasionally in anthropological and archaeological theory to refer to the rulers of multiple chiefdoms or the rulers of exceptionally powerful chiefdoms that have subordinated others. Paramount chiefs were identified by English-speakers as existing in Native American confederacies and regional chiefdoms, such as the Powhatan Confederacy and Piscataway Native Americans encountered by English colonists in the Chesapeake Bay area of North America.  - The Massachusett are a Native American people who historically lived in areas surrounding Massachusetts Bay, as well as northeast and southern Massachusetts in what is now the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including present-day Greater Boston. Tribal members spoke the Massachusett language, which is part of the Algonquian language family. The present-day U.S state of Massachusetts is named after the tribe.  - The White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) is a federally managed forest contained within the White Mountains in the northeastern United States. It was established in 1918 as a result of the Weeks Act of 1911; federal acquisition of land had already begun in 1914. It has a total area of (1,225 sq mi). Most of the WMNF is in New Hampshire; a small part (about 5.65% of the forest) is in the neighboring state of Maine. While often casually referred to as a park, this is a National Forest, used not only for hiking, camping, and skiing, but for logging and other limited commercial purposes. The WMNF is the only National Forest located in either New Hampshire or Maine. Most of the major peaks over 4,000 feet high for peak-bagging in New Hampshire are located in the National Forest. Over of the Appalachian Trail traverses the White Mountain National Forest. In descending order of land area the forest lies in parts of Grafton, Coos, and Carroll counties in New Hampshire, and Oxford County in Maine.  - The Pennacook, also known by the names Penacook, and Pennacock, were a North American people of the Wabanaki Confederacy who primarily inhabited the Merrimack River valley of present-day New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as portions of southern Maine. They are also sometimes called the Merrimack people.   - The Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a subgroup of the Algonquian languages. Prior to European contact, Eastern Algonquian consisted of at least 17 languages, collectively occupying the Atlantic coast of North America and adjacent inland areas from what are now known as the Canadian Maritime provinces to North Carolina. The available information about individual languages varies widely. Some are known only from one or two documents containing words and phrases collected by missionaries, explorers or settlers, and some documents contain fragmentary evidence about more than one language or dialect. Nearly all of the Eastern Algonquian languages are extinct. Mi'kmaq and Malecite-Passamaquoddy have appreciable numbers of speakers, but Western Abnaki and Delaware are each reported to have fewer than 10 speakers after 2000.  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - The Wabanaki Confederacy (\\"Wabenaki, Wobanaki\\", translated roughly as \\"People of the First Light\\" or \\"People of the Dawnland\\") are a First Nations and Native American confederation of five principal nations: the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot.  - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest by land area and the 9th least populous of the 50 United States.  - Maine is the northernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.

Those aboard an American Airlines airplane from London got to see a little more of America than they expected Friday, after their flight was diverted to Tulsa, Oklahoma, due to engine trouble. Flight 79 took off from Heathrow Airport at 3 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), destined for Dallas, Texas, according to American Airlines' website. The Boeing 777-200 airliner made it over the United States, but not to its final destination. It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. She did not specify what the issue was. Its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at Tulsa's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. CT (7:30 p.m. ET). One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. That means the aircraft's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport's tarmac, according to Masvidal. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa. According to American's website, it should have Flight 79's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs Oklahoma at 10 p.m. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport a few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. For those keeping score at home, that amounts to 14 hours after Flight 79's passengers first took off from London. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.

Jason Kidd burns bridge with Nets, but may be left in limbo as Bucks balk at pick demands Now it’s just a leverage contest and a haggle over Jason Kidd’s worth – a fitting conclusion considering this all started because of Kidd’s overinflated sense of self. A decision on the Kidd fiasco is expected Monday, and it hinges on the Nets and Bucks getting over their compensation chasm, according to sources. Brooklyn has been determined to get a first-rounder in any swap – and has asked for the next year’s draft choice — but the Bucks are reportedly threatening to pull away from negotiations if the Nets don’t accept their offer of a 2015 second-round pick. Either way, it appears that bridges are burned and Kidd won’t return to the Nets, at least not in any relevant capacity. They still owe him 5 million in guaranteed salary. The only precedent of an NBA coach trade is Doc Rivers going to the Clippers last year, netting the Celtics a first-round pick. Of course, Rivers won an NBA title and advanced to two Finals prior to that deal. Kidd’s resume includes 44 victories with the highest payroll in league history. A source close to the situation confirmed that Kidd had met Friday with the Bucks in New York after the Nets granted permission. This after he went to a press conference the day before at which he thanked Nets ownership and said he was “honored” to coach a team with the “best facilities in the world.” Irina Pavlova, the president of Mikhail Prokhorov’s Onexim Sports, said she was excited about the job Kidd did last season and was happy to provide him a “worthy” practice facility in Brooklyn, one that will cost about 50 million. The next day, Kidd was interviewing for a job with the worst team in the NBA last season. The Bucks, despite their lowly status, have greater selling points now than in recent years. They have new owners – including one partner, Mark Lasry, who is reportedly Kidd’s good pal — and they drafted Jabari Parker with the second pick last week. If Kidd is out, the Nets are expected to look outside of the organization for a new coach – preferably an established one who can clean up a mess – with out-of-work veterans Lionel Hollins and George Karl as leading candidates. The next coach would represent Brooklyn’s fourth in less than two years, joining Kidd, Avery Johnson and P.J. Carlesimo. But Kidd was the golden child. The Nets rolled out the carpet for the future Hall of Famer. They hired him despite a pending DWI charge and suspension, giving him a marketing slogan and a press conference. They sold him an ownership stake in the team. They handed him a roster full of All-Stars and proven veterans, with a rope so long he was allowed to start 10-21 with his job intact. They retired his jersey with the first such ceremony under the Russians, all with the understanding that this was the same player who forced his way out of the organization with a faked migraine. He was ownership’s hire — not GM Billy King’s — and the subject of its praises and faith up until now. “He made a mistake if he thinks he’s going to a better situation in Milwaukee,” an NBA executive said. “Not to mention, he’s taking somebody else’s job when he already had a better one.” There are plenty of reasons Kidd decided to demand more power in the Nets organization, none more simply explained than it’s indicative of his personality and behavior patterns. Broken down, though, it’s about money and ego. Kidd, who signed a four-year, 10.5 million deal with the Nets, was peeved that first-time coaches Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher netted contracts nearly double his own. It apparently didn’t matter that the Nets were the only team offering Kidd a coaching job just weeks removed from his retirement. He also had a “strained” relationship with King, according to ESPN, which would explain why Kidd plotted to hijack the hierarchy and demand a position similar to Rivers’ in L.A. and Gregg Popovich’s in San Antonio. Instead, Kidd lost the faith of the ownership. The 41-year-old went from being a coach-killer as a player to committing coach-suicide. What this means for the Nets in free agency is still unclear, although instability is not a good selling point. The timing of the turmoil is troubling for the Nets, who are attempting to re-sign two players with close ties to Kidd – Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston. So they begin summer league this week with three new draft picks and a head coach pushing his way to the worst team in the NBA last season. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

It appears that Kidd's actions led to burning bridges with the Nets, and he would not be returning to the team. The article also mentions Kidd's strained relationship with the Nets' General Manager, Billy King, and his unhappiness at being paid less than first-time coaches Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher. The instability caused by these events might have had an impact on the Nets' ability to re-sign players with close ties to Kidd, such as Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The 747-8 Intercontinental is designed to carry passengers and is currently the longest passenger aircraft in the world. It offers several improvements over the previous 747 versions, such as enhanced fuel efficiency, reduced noise, and greater range capabilities. Able to carry up to 467 passengers in a typical three-class configuration, it provides airlines with lower operating costs and better environmental performance. The 747-8I was launched with Lufthansa as the first customer, and other major airlines, such as Korean Air and Air China, have also added this aircraft to their fleets. The 747-8 Freighter, on the other hand, is a dedicated cargo aircraft designed to carry a wide range of cargo, from large machinery and equipment to perishable goods, in its large cargo hold. The 747-8F maintains the iconic nose-loading feature of the 747 aircraft family, allowing for efficient loading and unloading of cargo. The freighter version offers a higher payload capacity and improved fuel efficiency compared to its predecessors, making it an attractive choice for cargo operators. Companies like Cargolux, UPS, and Cathay Pacific Cargo have adopted the 747-8F in their cargo fleets.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who Mattheson claims was trimmed into other fashions by \\"the lofty schooling of opera\\"?, using the article: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\"., what would be the answer ?

Which entity is this text about? Samuel Dale Brownback (born September 12, 1956) is an American lawyer, politician, diplomat and the current United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom since 2018. Brownback previously served as the 46th Governor of Kansas, as a U.S. Senator from Kansas, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and as the Secretary of Agriculture of Kansas. A member of the Republican Party, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives during the Republican Revolution of 1994, representing Kansas's 2nd congressional district for a single term, before running in a 1996 special election for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Bob Dole. He won the special election and the following two regular elections, serving until 2011. Brownback signed three anti-abortion bills in 2011. In April 2011, he signed a bill banning abortion after 21 weeks, and a bill requiring that a doctor get a parent's notarized signature before providing an abortion to a minor. In May 2011, Brownback approved a bill prohibiting insurance companies from offering abortion coverage as part of general health plans unless the procedure is necessary to save a woman's life. The law also prohibits any health-insurance exchange in Kansas established under the federal Affordable Care Act from offering coverage for abortions other than to save a woman's life.  A Kansas budget passed with Brownback's approval in 2011 blocked Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri from receiving family planning funds from the state. The funding amounted to about 330,000 a year. A judge has blocked the budget provision, ordered Kansas to begin funding the organization again, and agreed with Planned Parenthood that it was being unfairly targeted. In response, the state filed an appeal seeking to overturn the judge's decision. Brownback has defended anti-abortion laws in Kansas, including the Planned Parenthood defunding. \\"You can't know for sure what all comes out of that afterwards, but it was the will of the Legislature and the people of the state of Kansas\\", Brownback said.  In May 2012, Brownback signed the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act, which \\"will allow pharmacists to refuse to provide drugs they believe might cause an abortion\\".  In April 2013, Brownback signed a bill that blocked tax breaks for abortion providers, banned sex-selection abortions and declared that life begins at fertilization. The law notes that any rights suggested by the language are limited by U.S. Supreme Court decisions.  On April 7, 2015, Brownback signed The Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which bans the most common technique used for second-trimester abortions. This made Kansas the first state to do so.","output":"This text is about Samuel Dale Brownback.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.

Alice Paul's early life in New Jersey greatly influenced her later work as a suffragist and women's rights activist. She attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution co-founded by her grandfather, where she studied biology and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1905. She then continued her education in England, where she earned a master's degree in sociology from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania. While in England, Alice Paul became actively involved in the British suffrage movement, led by prominent activists like Emmeline Pankhurst. She participated in multiple protests and demonstrations, which ultimately led to her arrest and imprisonment on several occasions. These experiences further cemented her determination to fight for women's right to vote. In 1910, Alice Paul returned to the United States and became a key player in the American suffrage movement. She joined the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and played a vital role in organizing events and advocating for women's voting rights. Later on, she co-founded the National Woman's Party (NWP) with fellow suffragist Lucy Burns. Together, they led a number of significant campaigns, including the Silent Sentinels – a non-violent protest in front of the White House that continued for over two years. Thanks to the tireless work of Alice Paul and many other suffragists, the 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920, granting women the right to vote in the United States. After achieving this historic milestone, Alice Paul continued to advocate for women's rights throughout her life. She played an essential role in drafting the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in 1923, which aimed to provide legal equality to men and women nationwide. In summary, Alice Paul was born in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, on January 11, 1885. Her upbringing and education, alongside her experiences in the British suffrage movement, paved the way for her lifelong commitment to the fight for women's rights and suffrage in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America. The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the U.S. and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget.

Kids make a person responsible and mature and help us to understand life better. Happiness and sorrow Materialistic happiness is short-lived, but happiness achieved by bringing a smile on others face gives a certain level of fulfillment. Peace of mind is the main link to happiness. No mind is happy without peace. We realize the true worth of happiness when we are in sorrow. Sorrow is basically due to death of a loved one, failure and despair. But these things are temporary and pass away. Failure and success Failure is the path to success.

Question: I have a new situation: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets. A few months later however, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations and find other sources of income. they wanted to protect the environment.  But I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  What is an answer for this question: Which village made less money from sand mining? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be deduced that Hammond made less money from sand mining compared to Soundville.  There are several factors that contribute to this conclusion. First, Hammond decided to stop all mining operations after only a few months, which means they had a limited time to generate revenue from this activity. In contrast, Soundville did not stop their sand mining operations, and therefore, it is likely that they continued generating income for a longer period. Another aspect worth considering is that while both towns started sand mining to boost their budgets, Hammond made a conscious decision to shift their focus to other sources of income to protect the environment. This further indicates that financially, the town of Hammond may have been less dependent on sand mining than Soundville.  Lastly, it is important to note that the negative environmental impacts and potential legal issues related to sand mining might have discouraged Hammond from continuing their operations, thus resulting in less revenue generation from this specific venture. In summary, given the limited timeline of sand mining in Hammond and their decision to prioritize environmental protection and explore alternative income sources, it can be concluded that Hammond made less money from sand mining compared to Soundville."},{"instruction":"-  Food is put into mouth - Food is chewed and mixed with saliva (spit) - Food travels down the esophagus (throat) - Food travels into the stomach - Acid in the stomach breaks the food down further - Food travels into the small intestine - Nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream - Food travels into the large intestine - Most of the remaining material is now waste  What might be the last step of the process?

Those infected have no history of recent international travel, the Florida Department of Health said Tuesday, \\"so exposure was likely from local mosquitoes.\\" The cases were reported in two southeastern Florida counties: Martin and Miami-Dade. Dengue acquired from local mosquitoes is rare in the United States, Florida health officials said, urging residents to take steps such as wearing repellent to protect against mosquito-borne illnesses. Dengue fever is passed from person to person by mosquitoes. Unlike malaria, there are no drugs to prevent it. It also is difficult to treat and thus far, attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. The World Health Organization estimates that there are between 50 million and 100 million infections each year. Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. In extreme cases, it can cause death. According to the World Health Organization, about 12,000 people die of dengue fever each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say dengue rarely occurs in the United States. But this isn't the first time Florida has dealt with dengue. In 2009 and 2010, officials documented 28 locally acquired cases in Key West.

Seeing them standing there together, an incognito air of familiarity surrounding them, she felt, for the first time in days, a wave of inexplicable panic wash over her. Suddenly, as if a silent signal had passed between them, Nate's eyes lifted to meet hers, locking her into an impenetrable gaze that held a strange mix of surprise and guilt. His usually bright eyes were clouded now, holding a previously undiscovered layer of depth that made her heart throb painfully.

The air felt heavier, denser, making it hard for her to breathe. Each moment stacked upon the other, lengthening the seconds into small eternities. Silence loomed over them, making the soft hum of the buzzing streetlights in the backdrop almost deafening.  Her ordinarily vivacious spirit now felt muted, but there was a storm raging in her heart. The sudden visual she stumbled upon had thrown her into a whirl of questions she, unfortunately, had no answers to. But she was resolute.

Matthew was failing at dribbling.; Answer:","output":"Answer: (I). Kyle was failing at dribbling. As Kyle just started playing soccer, it is quite common for him to struggle with some basic skills such as dribbling. When someone is new to a particular sport, it requires some time and practice to get familiar with the game dynamics and improve their techniques. Dribbling is an essential component of soccer, which involves moving the ball on the ground by using different parts of the foot. For a beginner like Kyle, falling short in his dribbling attempts is a normal part of his learning process, providing him valuable opportunities to learn from his mistakes and eventually become better at the game. On the other hand, Matthew had been playing for years and presumably has a considerable amount of experience under his belt. He has spent a significant amount of time practicing, improving his skills, and mastering various techniques, including dribbling. It would be rather odd if Matthew was failing at dribbling, given his long-term involvement in soccer. He is more likely to be proficient in this skill, and might even be a potential mentor for Kyle in helping him learn and enhance his dribbling abilities. As soccer is a team sport, collaboration and support between players are crucial aspects of achieving success. With Matthew as an experienced teammate, Kyle is bound to develop his skills over time with practice, perseverance, and perhaps mentorship from those around him who can show him the ropes and guide him on his soccer journey. In due course, this might lead to an improved performance from Kyle, contributing to a more effective and harmonious team dynamic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process:  - Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Hotter dryer weather prevents rain happens, how will it affect The acidic reaction decreases.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Under the given perturbation hypothesis, the suggested changes in weather conditions (hotter and drier weather preventing rainfall) would have a direct impact on the process of cave formation involving limestone dissolution through the acidic reactions caused by rainwater. To elaborate, let's revisit each step of the process and analyze how the perturbation hypothesis may affect each: 1. Rock formation: As the hypothesis doesn't mention any changes in geological processes or rock formation, the presence of limestone in the ground, in this case, will remain unaffected. 2. Rain exposure: Hotter and drier weather conditions would result in less frequent rainfall events. When less rain hits the limestone, the overall contact time between the limestone and rainwater would decrease. 3. Acidic reaction: Rainwater is mildly acidic in nature, primarily due to the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, forming a weak carbonic acid solution (H2O + CO2 → H2CO3). This weak acid is responsible for the dissolution of limestone rock (calcium carbonate), leading to the formation of soluble calcium bicarbonate. This reaction is as follows: CaCO3 + H2CO3 → Ca(HCO3)2. In the given perturbation hypothesis, with less rainfall occurring, the acidic reaction between rainwater and limestone will decrease due to a lack of available acid to dissolve the limestone. 4. Limestone disintegration: Reduced acidic reactions would slow down the limestone dissolution process, resulting in a decreased rate of disintegration. Consequently, caves would either take longer to form or fail to form at all in areas experiencing prolonged periods of minimal rainfall. 5. Gap formation: As limestone disintegration is directly related to the formation of caves, a slower disintegration rate would lead to a much slower pace of gap formation within the limestone bedrock. 6. Cave formation: Ultimately, the perturbation hypothesis of hotter and drier weather preventing rainfall directly affects the process of cave formation by decreasing the rate of limestone dissolution in affected regions. This would result in caves taking longer to form or even no cave formation at all due to a lack of suitable environmental conditions for the limestone to dissolve and form gaps. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation has a direct effect on the process of cave formation via acidic reactions in limestone. Hotter and drier weather conditions preventing rain result in a reduced frequency of acidic reactions, leading to slower limestone disintegration and gap formation. As a consequence, this directly impacts the cave formation process, potentially hindering the development of caves in affected regions or causing existing caves to evolve at a much slower pace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During Prohibition, Laurel and Hardy are sent to prison for concocting and selling their own home brew. They are put in a cell with \\"Tiger\\" Long, the roughest, toughest and meanest of all inmates. Stan has a loose tooth that causes him to emit a razzberry at the end of every sentence; the inmate interprets this as a coolly defiant attitude and is impressed—nobody else ever stood up to him like that. He and Stan become fast friends. Laurel & Hardy are assigned to attend prison school with James Finlayson being the teacher. The vaudeville routine that follows ends with a spitball meant for somebody else hitting the teacher in the face and the boys wind up in solitary. There is a sustained scene of the bleak cells with the unseen boys conversing through the walls. After a prison break, the boys escape to a cotton plantation, where they hide out undetected, in blackface. The boys sing \\"Lazy Moon\\". When they attempt to repair the warden's car, they are discovered and are sent back to prison. The prison authorities decide to send Laurel to the prison dentist to have the offending tooth pulled, but the dentist is incompetent and the procedure goes awry.

Laurel causes a disturbance by protesting the absence of the feast, but is threatened by the guards. Soon after, as guns are being passed around under the tables, Laurel sets off his gun and causes an uproar. They inadvertently break up the prison riot and the grateful warden issues them a pardon.

What is the most widely spoken African language?","output":"The most widely spoken African language is Swahili, also known as Kiswahili. It is a Bantu language and has its roots in the African Great Lakes region. Swahili boasts millions of speakers and is particularly prevalent in Eastern and Southeastern Africa, serving as either the first, second, or third language for many individuals. Swahili has approximately 100 million speakers across various countries, with Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the primary areas where the language is spoken. It functions as a lingua franca— a common language bridging people of diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds— which facilitates communication and commerce throughout the region. In Tanzania and Kenya, Swahili is an official language alongside English, and the language is widely used in education, administration, and local media. It is also taught as a subject in schools across East and Central Africa. Swahili has a standardized written form in the Latin script due to the influence of European missionaries and colonizers, as well as the efforts of local Swahili scholars. Swahili's vocabulary incorporates a significant number of loanwords from other languages. Its primary influence is from Bantu languages, but it has also drawn from Arabic, as a result of extended historical interaction between Arabs and Swahili coastal communities through trade and religion. Other loanwords come from languages like Persian, English, Portuguese, and even German, reflecting various global influences on Swahili-speaking regions throughout history. Moreover, Swahili culture is amazingly rich, comprising various elements of music, literature, and traditional crafts. Swahili literature, for example, has deep historical roots and is famous for its poetry and epics, including the classic work \\"Utendi wa Tambuka\\" and the famous Swahili epic, \\"Utendi wa Shufaka.\\" The language's extensive reach and its vivid, expressive character have rendered Swahili an influential force in African literature, music, art, and culture.  Due to its widespread use and prominence in diplomacy, business, and education, Swahili has garnered increasing international attention. As a result, it is taught in many universities around the world, which has contributed to the expansion and recognition of Swahili as the most widely spoken African language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Retail therapy has long been considered as a good way to let off stress. Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters.

Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (born December 25, 1958) is an American retired professional baseball left fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four stints with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. Nicknamed \\"The Man of Steal\\", he is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner. He holds the major league records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) Following a mid-season trade to Oakland in 1989, Henderson reasserted himself as one of the game's greatest players, with a memorable half-season in which his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the A's into the postseason; his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five runs batted in (RBI), seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. Leading the A's to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases. On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \\"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\\"  A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was 2nd in slugging % (.577), 4th in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), 6th in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBI and Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.  On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Lou Brock's total compiled from 1962 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals.  In 1993, Henderson was having another outstanding season when he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays at the trade deadline. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (2nd in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs.

Arabic (, ' or ' or ) is a Central Semitic language complex that first emerged in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, in northwestern Arabia, and in the Sinai peninsula.  The modern written language (Modern Standard Arabic) is derived from Classical Arabic. It is widely taught in schools and universities, and is used to varying degrees in workplaces, government, and the media. The two formal varieties are grouped together as Literary Arabic (\\"fuṣḥā\\"), which is the official language of 26 states and the liturgical language of Islam. Modern Standard Arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary. However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties, and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties. Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the post-classical era, especially in modern times.  During the Middle Ages, Literary Arabic was a major vehicle of culture in Europe, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. As a result, many European languages have also borrowed many words from it. Arabic influence, mainly in vocabulary, is seen in European languages, mainly Spanish and to a lesser extent Portuguese, Valencian and Catalan, owing to both the proximity of Christian European and Muslim Arab civilizations and 800 years of Arabic culture and language in the Iberian Peninsula, referred to in Arabic as al-Andalus. Sicilian has about 500 Arabic words as result of Sicily being progressively conquered by Saracens from North Africa, from the mid 9th to mid 10th centuries.

What was the name of the album released in 2002 by the band that played at Lollapalooza in 1994?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1993, the Breeders released their second album, Last Splash. At this time, the group's lineup  consisted of sisters Kim and Kelley Deal on guitar and vocals, Josephine Wiggs on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. Last Splash was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at Lollapalooza 1994. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, the Amps, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums Title TK (2002) and Mountain Battles (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and Jose Medeles. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of Last Splash—the LSXX Tour.On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in Austin, Texas. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together. Throughout 2014, Wiggs traveled from her home in Brooklyn, New York to Dayton, Ohio, near where Macpherson and both Deals lived. The group began practicing new material in Kim Deal's basement, including compositions by her and one by Wiggs. By August, there were three new songs they could play well, two less so, and others they had not yet practiced. Reported titles were \\"Skinhead #2\\", \\"Simone\\", \\"All Nerve\\", and \\"Launched\\". The band Neutral Milk Hotel asked the Breeders to open for them at a Hollywood Bowl concert to be held on September 18. The latter decided to go on tour leading up to this show and to perform some new compositions in preparation for their eventual recording. The answer to this question is:","output":"The album released in 2002 by the Breeders, the band that played at Lollapalooza in 1994, was \\"Title TK\\".  This information was identified by carefully reading the provided context and extracting key pieces of information. The context mentions that the Breeders played at Lollapalooza in 1994. It also separately points out that one of their albums, \\"Title TK\\", was released in 2002. Thus, aligning these facts together answers the question accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected? Options: - Because she thought the other actress did a bad job - Because she was treated like a liar - not enough information - Because the role had to be changed for the new actress Answer:","output":"Because she was treated like a liar"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And there is always a way of coping with yourself , in ways appropriate for your particular situation , you just need to find one that works for you . Answer the following question: What may happen if one does n't pursue safe self - care avenues ?","output":"If one doesn't pursue safe self-care avenues, several negative consequences may arise, affecting not only their physical and emotional well-being but also their relationships and overall quality of life. Some of the potential implications are: 1. Deterioration of physical health: Neglecting self-care can lead to poor physical health, as the individual might not prioritize essential activities such as exercise, sleep, and proper nutrition. Over time, the lack of self-care can contribute to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and an overall weakened immune system. 2. Decline in mental health: Mental health issues may arise if an individual fails to seek out safe self-care strategies. Ongoing stress, anxiety, and negative emotions can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or even lead to new ones, such as depression or chronic anxiety disorders. 3. Decreased productivity: When an individual is not practicing self-care, they may experience a decline in productivity due to reduced energy and focus. Fatigue, burnout, and difficulty concentrating can all result from neglecting well-being, making it challenging to complete tasks and perform at optimal levels in personal and professional life. 4. Strained relationships: Insufficient self-care can create strain on personal and professional relationships. When an individual is not taking care of themselves, they may become irritable or exhibit mood swings, causing tension and conflict with others. Over time, this can lead to damaged relationships, social isolation, and a lack of support from friends and loved ones. 5. Poor decision-making: Neglecting self-care can cloud one's judgment and hinder their ability to make rational decisions. Emotional distress and lack of focus can often result in impulsive choices or an inability to concentrate on complex issues, which can negatively impact various aspects of life. 6. Increased risk of substance abuse: Individuals who fail to seek out safe self-care measures might resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as alcohol, drugs, or other addictive substances. Over time, substance abuse can lead to addiction and exacerbate existing physical and mental health issues. 7. Low self-esteem: Self-care is an essential component of fostering a positive self-image and cultivating self-confidence. By neglecting self-care, individuals risk developing a negative self-perception, which can hinder their ability to advocate for themselves, form meaningful connections, and achieve personal goals. 8. Compromised resilience: Effective self-care bolsters one's resilience in the face of adversity. By not taking care of themselves, individuals may lack the necessary emotional resources to effectively cope with challenging situations and bounce back from setbacks. In summary, neglecting safe self-care avenues can have long-lasting, detrimental effects on an individual's physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Pursuing healthy self-care practices is essential for maintaining overall health, nurturing personal and professional relationships, staying productive, and enhancing one's quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on August 17, 1958 to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (nee Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. Carlisle's first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad.  Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded The Go-Go's (originally named the Misfits), with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group and the new line-up included bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: \\"[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,\\" she said.  The Go-Go's would go on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first all-female band who wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, Beauty and the Beat, which featured the hits \\"We Got the Beat\\" and \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\". The Go-Go's recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982's Vacation, which went gold. \\"Head over Heels\\", from their 1984 album Talk Show, made it to No. 11.  In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie Swing Shift, starring alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

Article: For teenagers, it's great fun to explore new places and it feels like an adventure, even when you know you're not the first to have been there. But to make sure not to get lost or waste time going round in circles, the following tips may be helpful. *Do the map reading if you're being driven somewhere. It'll be easier if you keep the map following the direction you are traveling in. Keep looking ahead so that you can give the driver lots of warning before having to make a turn, or you'll have to move to the back seat. *Get a group of friends together and go exploring. You'll need a good map, a compass, a raincoat, a cell phone to call for help in case you get lost, and a bit of spare cash for emergencies. Tell someone where you're going before you set out and let them know what time you expect to be back. The purpose of the activity is in not getting lost, not in seeing how fast you can go, so always stick together, waiting for slower friends to catch up. *See if your school or a club organizes orienteering  activities, in which you need a map and a compass to find your way.

No The sentence \\"The second decline was not as complete as the first\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Why was the second decline in popularity not as strong as the first?\\" While it does confirm that the second decline was not as strong or complete as the first, it does not provide any reasons or explanations for the differences between the two declines. To properly answer the question, it is important to identify and discuss the factors or circumstances that contributed to the disparity between the first and second declines in popularity. This could include a variety of factors such as changes in public opinion, differences in marketing or promotional efforts, alterations in the quality or nature of the product or service being discussed, shifts in the competitive environment, or other external influences that might have affected the outcomes. For example, a more comprehensive and detailed answer could be: The second decline in popularity was not as strong as the first because several factors contributed to the diminished impact. Firstly, during the second decline, the product benefited from increased marketing efforts, which helped maintain a higher level of public interest and engagement compared to the first period of decline. Secondly, the product had undergone improvements in its quality and features, making it more appealing to consumers and helping to offset some of the negative factors leading to the decline. Additionally, during the second decline, competitors in the market faced their own challenges, which made it difficult for them to capitalize on the declining popularity and attract customers away from the product in question.

Please answer the following question: Since American students have been introduced into the era of the Massive Open Online Course, the opportunity for cheating appears greater than ever. The all-knowing Google search engine is within easy reach. So how can a teacher handle such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet? Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam   and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out. Mettl has adopted a mass of technologies on its test-taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here's how it works: A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his/her exam from the site's library of pre-loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test-taker (through the webcam) and the test-taker's screen throughout the test. Mettl's technology uses the test-taker's webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker's screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to. If any wrongdoings are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test's administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver's wishes: a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker's screen, even human instructions from the control center.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the village the Sharpe family lived in after moving from Geneva?  On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47.  The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road.  Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries.

Thread your needle with matching, lightweight thread, and sew straight across your hem roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) away from the raw edge.  After sewing this line, trim the edge so that there is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) between the thread line and the raw edge. This stitch will end up being on the bottom of your hem. It should help you maintain an even, consistent roll. Fold the raw edge toward the wrong side of the fabric and press in place using an iron.  While not entirely necessary, pressing the fold in place will make the hem less likely to unroll as you stitch. Fold the fabric so that the bend falls just past your initial row of stitching. You should see your initial stitching along the underside of the fabric but not from the front. Pick up one thread from the fabric and a small stitch from the edge of your fold. Pull the needle through, but do not pull it taut just yet.  Use a small, sharp needle for best results. Doing so will make it easier to pick up single threads along your hem. The stitch made into your fold should be as close to the actual fold as possible. Position it in between your initial line of stitching and the fold itself. The threads you pick up from the front of the actual fabric should be directly above the stitch made into your fold. These threads should also be right above the raw edge. Make sure that you only pick up one or two threads from the fabric. Picking up more will cause the hem to be more visible from the front of the fabric. Each stitch should only pick up one or two threads from the fabric, and the stitches should be spaced roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) apart. Repeat this until you have 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of hem stitching. Lightly pull on the thread in the direction of your stitching. The raw edge should roll itself down into your hem, disappearing from sight.  Use firm pressure, but do not pull tightly. Pulling too tightly can cause the fabric to bunch up. Smooth out any bubbles or bumps with your fingers. Continue stitching along the rest of the hem in the same manner until you reach the end. Knot off the end and cut off any excess thread.  As you get better at the process, you can pull the thread after 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stitching rather than every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). If completed correctly, the raw edge should be hidden along the wrong side of the fabric and the hem stitching should be barely visible from the front. The hem may already be smooth enough, but if desired, use an iron to press it further. This step completes the process.

News article: Sponsored Links      (Sept. 28) -- The gunman who opened fire today at the University of Texas' Austin campus before killing himself was a 19-year-old student, officials said.The suspect was identified as Colton Tooley, a sophomore math major from Austin, university spokesman Don Hale told AOL News in a phone interview.The suspect was wearing a ski mask and suit and carrying an AK-47 as he ran through the campus this morning, firing randomly before he went into the library and shot himself to death, according to officials and a witness.No other injuries were reported, but police locked down the sprawling campus earlier as they checked reports of a second gunman.The suspected gunman acted alone, UT Police Chief Robert Dahlstrom told The Associated Press . He told reporters earlier today that witnesses gave multiple descriptions of a second gunman, leading police to set up a perimeter to check whether there might have been a second suspect. Officials later ruled out another shooter.\\"We're very fortunate in the fact that no one else was injured, other than the lone gunman that we know of at this point,\\" Dahlstrom said.Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said police also were searching to make sure no explosives were left behind.Hale told the Austin American-Statesman that the university sent emergency text messages to students and faculty in the morning warning them to stay away from the Perry Castaneda Library and to remain indoors.

Austin and University of Texas police were searching his home on Western Drive in South Austin on Tuesday afternoon. Tooley, who killed himself at the Perry-Casteneda Library around 8:40 a.m. after firing shots outside on campus, was a student in UT's College of Natural Sciences.      Neighbors near the house on Western Drive said that around 11:45 a.m., family members were gathered at the home - several of them appearing distraught, with one woman sobbing.      Officials said the gunman began firing shots with his semi-automatic weapon randomly at 21st Street and University Drive. Witnesses heard at least 10 shots before they pointed police toward Tooley. Officers were able to then chase him off the streets, away from students, and into the PCL building - where he committed suicide.      No other injuries were reported, and police never fired their weapons.      On Tuesday afternoon, UT President Bill Powers - who had been giving media briefings all morning - released the following statement:      \\"I extend my sympathy to the family, friends, and classmates of the young student who took his life. In the days ahead we will attempt to understand his actions and to learn from this tragedy. We invite those who would like counseling services to contact the Counseling and Mental Health Center (for students) or the Employee Assistance Program (for staff and faculty).\\"      Gov. Perry made the following comments at a press conference in San Antonio on an unrelated subject:      “Before we get started, I want to make a brief statement regarding the incident at the University of Texas this morning.      We understand there was a shooter on the University of Texas campus this morning who is now deceased.      Additional reports of what transpired continue to flow in, but this is an ongoing investigation by law enforcement at this time.      I want to thank campus officials and law enforcement, including the Austin Police Department, DPS and others, for their swift action, that protected the students and faculty on campus this morning.      As always, they were highly-professional and swift in their response, and we are blessed to have such brave peace officers protecting our citizens.”      Just weeks before Tuesday, Austin and university police conducted a joint training exercise that prepared them for critical situations much like this.      In addition, Austin Police Department Chief Art Acevedo emphasized three things:      The importance of preparedness. \\"It became readily apparent that the University of Texas was prepared for this situation,\\" said Acevedo. Rapid response. Authorities were almost immediately on campus and chased the gunman inside the library building. Acevedo commended the students who led the way to the suspect as they kept pointing law enforcement in the right direction. Agency collaboration      University of Texas Police Department Chief Robert Dahlstrom said at 12:30 p.m. that a search for a potential second gunman or suspect turned up nothing - and that initial witness speculation that there may have been two threatening individuals appear to be false. He also said that multiple descriptions of the same person led to the belief of that second person.      \\"There is no doubt training paid off in this situation,\\" said Dahlstrom.      Authorities said the gunman fired a minimum of four shots from a 7.62-mm firearm into the building.      Though no one was injured, EMS did treat two people for minor injuries, which police said were unrelated to the gunman but rather due to the commotion and movement in response to the incident.      The all-clear was issued for University of Texas faculty and students around noon, meaning they can leave campus but cannot go in the investigation area where the shooting took place. The PCL is the only area that is currently contained.      Authorities - in a multiagency effort - had spent several hours searching fervently for a possible second suspect after a gunman entered the University of Texas Perry Castenada library with an AK-47, fired off shots and then shot himself.      \\"This is a very critical incident,\\" said UT President Bill Powers. \\"The University of Texas Police Department and Austin Police Department responded extremely professionally this morning.\\"      For more information, people are directed to call 1-866-657-9400 or (512) 471-2255.      Armored vehicles and helicopters surrounded the scene on campus as a number of agencies conducted secondary searches to eliminate explosives that could \\"have been left behind by one or more suspects.\\"      K-9 officers swept areas around campus, conducting sniff searches mainly around the University Drive area.      \\"We are very fortunate in the fact that no one else was injured, other than the lone gunman,\\" said UT Police Department Chief Robert Dahlstrom.      \\"No shots were fired by members of law enforcement,\\" said Acevedo.

Q: The single circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in what, but instead occupies a specific location called the nucleoid within the cell?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Binary Fission Due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell (Figure 10.2). Although the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. The bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (Figure 10.15). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. A septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.

It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel in circumference, as deep as beneath the FranceSwitzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7 TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012. On 13 February 2013 the LHC's first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. 'Test' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015.  - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union.

Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the \\"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\\" in 1798.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Terence Joseph \\"Terry\\" Nation (8 August 1930 - 9 March 1997) was a Welsh television writer and novelist. Nation first made his name as a comedy writer before becoming a prolific writer for drama, working on many of the most popular British series of the 1960s and 1970s. He made a significant contribution to the long-running BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who from its outset, creating the villainous Daleks which established its early popularity and later devising the recurring character of Davros. Prior to this, Nation had declined an offer from scriptwriter David Whitaker to write for a new science-fiction programme that was entering production at the BBC; Whitaker had been impressed by a script that Nation had written for the ABC anthology series Out of this World. Now unemployed, and with a young family to support, Nation contacted Whitaker and accepted the offer, writing the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks (also known as The Mutants and The Dead Planet). The serial introduced the eponymous extraterrestrial villains that would quickly become the series' most popular and enduring monsters, and resulted in a major merchandising success for the BBC.  Having risen in the public consciousness, Nation went on to contribute further scripts to Doctor Who. In 1965, Nation and Dennis Spooner co-wrote the 12-part serial The Daleks' Master Plan, after which Nation, who still held the copyright to the Daleks, attempted to launch a Dalek spin-off TV series in the United States. Various other Dalek tie-in material appeared, including comic strips in the children's weekly TV Century 21 and annuals; such material was frequently credited to Nation, even when written by others. Between 1966 and 1972, appearances by the Daleks in Doctor Who became less frequent and were written for the series by other authors.  In 1973, following an eight-year absence from scriptwriting for the series, Nation returned to writing for the Daleks on Doctor Who with the Third Doctor serial Planet of the Daleks. In 1998, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Nation's 1975 serial Genesis of the Daleks the greatest Doctor Who story of all time. In the story, Nation introduced the character of Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who went on to appear in further storylines.  Nation also wrote two non-Dalek scripts for Doctor Who, The Keys of Marinus in 1964, which introduced the Voord and The Android Invasion in 1975, which introduced the Kraal. During this time, Nation also worked in commercial TV, contributing scripts to series such as The Avengers, The Baron, The Champions, Department S, The Persuaders! and The Saint.  Nation's work on Doctor Who was the subject of the documentary Terror Nation, a special feature on the BBC DVD release of the serial Destiny of the Daleks.

Here is a news article: Kiyoshi, left, and Mitsuko Serizawa sit in their living room with a portrait of their son, Kiyotaka, who killed himself a year ago after working 90-hour weeks as a supervisor at a building maintenance company (Anna Fifield/The Washington Post)      In the United States, there’s no end to stories and listicles and books telling you how to work more productively so you can spend more time with your family or doing the things you love.      In Japan, there’s not even a term for “work-life balance.” What there is, though, is a word for “death by overwork.” It’s “karoshi,” and it’s considered such an inevitable result of Japan’s notoriously grueling work culture that it’s hardly even discussed.      But every year here, hundreds, maybe thousands, of Japanese people literally work themselves to death.      Kiyotaka Serizawa was one of them.      A year ago in July, the 34-year-old killed himself after working crazy hours — 90 hours a week during the last weeks of his life — at a company that does maintenance at apartment buildings.      “His colleagues told me that they were amazed how much he worked,” his father, Kiyoshi Serizawa, said in an interview in their family home. “They said they’d never seen anyone who didn’t even own the company work so hard.”      Japan has a working culture where spending long hours at the grindstone, or in compulsory socializing with superiors after work, is the norm.      It began in the 1970s, when wages were relatively low and employees wanted to maximize their earnings. It continued through the boom years of the 1980s, when Japan became the world’s second-largest economy and everyone was on the juggernaut.      And it remained after the bubble burst in the late 1990s, when companies began restructuring and employees stayed at work to try to ensure they weren’t laid off.      Still, irregular workers — who worked without benefits or job security — were brought in, making the regular workers toil even harder.      Now, no one blinks an eyelid at 12-hour-plus days.      [ It’s official: Japan’s population is dramatically shrinking ]      “In a Japanese workplace, overtime work is always there. It’s almost as if it is part of scheduled working hours,” said Koji Morioka, an emeritus professor at Kansai University who is on a committee of experts advising the government on ways to combat karoshi. “It’s not forced by anyone, but workers feel it like it’s compulsory.”      While the basic workweek is 40 hours, many workers don’t put in for extra hours for fear of being given a bad performance evaluation. This has led to the concept of “service overtime” — “service” being Japanese for “free.”      This relentless schedule has led to karoshi — either from a fatal heart attack or stroke, or a suicide triggered by overwork — becoming a recognized cause of death. Labor ministry figures show that 189 deaths were classified this way last year, although experts think the actual number is in the thousands.      Karoshi has long been considered a male problem, but advocates say they’re seeing an increasing number of women dying, almost always by killing themselves.      The striking thing about them is that they’re very young, often in their 20s, said Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer and secretary-general of the National Defense Counsel for Victims of Karoshi, which fights for victims’ families.      Kawahito represented the family of a journalist in her early 30s who died of a heart attack. When a reporter gasped, he added: “It’s actually not rare in Japan for people in their early 30s to have heart attacks.”      Once a death is classified as karoshi, a victim’s family is automatically entitled to compensation through a kind of workers’ comp system. The number of claims for karoshi-related cases rose to a record high of 2,310 in the year ending in March, government figures show.      But less than a third of applications are successful , Kawahito said.      Kiyotaka Serizawa’s death was officially certified last month. He was a supervisor responsible for overseeing building janitors in three separate locations in this town northeast of Tokyo.      Struggling to keep up, Kiyotaka had tried to resign a year before his death, but his boss refused to accept his notice. Apparently concerned about inconveniencing his subordinates, he carried on working.      He would sometimes stop at his parents’ house to sleep as he drove between offices. “He would lie here on this couch and go into such a deep sleep that I would come and check on him to make sure his heart was still beating,” said his mother, Mitsuko Serizawa.      [ Why Japan will pay a big price for Britain’s vote to leave the E.U. ]      The last time his mother saw him was July last year, when he came to collect the laundry he’d been too busy to do. He stopped off for 10 minutes and watched some cute cat videos on his phone with his cat-mad mother.      But then, on July 26, he went missing. Three weeks later, his body was found in his car in Nagano Prefecture, not far from a place where he’d gone on family camping holidays as a child. He’d burned briquettes in his car and died from carbon monoxide poisoning.      Although karoshi has been a problem for several decades, it was only 18 months ago that the government passed legislation to try to tackle the problem.      The act sets specific targets, such as reducing the percentage of employees working for more than 60 hours a week to 5 percent by 2020, from the 8 to 9 percent range recorded in the past few years.      The government is also trying to get employees to actually take their paid vacation leave. Most Japanese workers get 20 days leave a year, but few take even half of that because of a working culture in which taking days off is seen as a sign of slacking or lack of commitment to the job.      The government hopes to entice workers to take at least 70 percent of their leave owed.      “If you’re conscious of this right, then you can show that there’s nothing wrong with taking time off,” said Yasukazu Kurio of the ministry of health and labor’s office for the prevention of karoshi. Kurio is trying to set a good example: Last year he took 17 of his 20 days.      Kawahito, the lawyer, said that the government’s efforts could have some impact at the margins but that they don’t deal with the fundamental problem.      “There’s nothing that’s stated under this act to penalize companies that break the rules,” said Kawahito, who’s not exactly a role model for work-life balance. As a younger lawyer, he used to work long hours, but now that he’s reached the age of 66, he’s cut back to about 60 hours a week.      Still, he wants to see a law like the European Working Time Directive that stipulates 11 hours off between shifts.      [ Japan is trying to save its economy with a Jedi mind trick ]      The karoshi problem is exacerbated by the relative weakness of labor unions, which have been primarily concerned with raising wages rather than shortening working hours, and the Japanese practice of having a job for life. Most university students go into a company or a ministry after graduation with the expectation they’ll be there until they retire.      “In a country like the U.S., people have more freedom to move to a company that treats you better,” said Kenichi Kuroda, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo who specializes in labor culture. “But in Japan, people tend to stay at one company for life, so it’s difficult for people to move on.”      Some companies, especially in the financial sector, are taking the initiative by allowing employees to come in earlier and leave earlier. So instead of working from nine to nine, they’re now working from seven to seven and can be home in time to see their children.      “These companies are finding ways to bring about social change, and it could influence other companies by showing how they’re creating a ‘dream lifestyle,’” Kuroda said, laughing to show he knew 12-hour days would not be considered revolutionary elsewhere.      Still, the problem is going to be difficult to alleviate.      Japan’s population is aging rapidly, with the workforce expected to shrink by at least a quarter by 2050. That means even fewer people available to work, increasing the workloads of those who remain.      Morioka, the professor, said that eliminating death by overwork will mean changing the entire working culture of Japan.      “It’s impossible to get rid of karoshi alone,” he said. “We need to change the overtime culture and create the time for family and hobbies. Long working hours are the root of all evil in Japan. People are so busy they don’t even have the time to complain.”      Yuki Oda contributed to this report.

Labor demand, with 1.28 jobs per applicant, is the highest since 1991, which should help Prime Minister Shinzo Abe draw more people into the workforce to counter the effect of a shrinking population, but lax enforcement of labor laws means some businesses are simply squeezing more out of employees, sometimes with tragic consequences.      Claims for compensation for karoshi rose to a record high of 1,456 in the year to end-March 2015, according to labor ministry data, with cases concentrated in healthcare, social services, shipping and construction, which are all facing chronic worker shortages.      Hiroshi Kawahito, secretary general of the National Defense Counsel for Victims of karoshi, said the real number was probably 10 times higher, as the government is reluctant to recognize such incidents.      “The government hosts a lot of symposiums and makes posters about the problem, but this is propaganda,” he said.      “The real problem is reducing working hours, and the government is not doing enough.”      The labor ministry did not respond to requests for comment.      Kawahito, a lawyer who has been dealing with karoshi since the 1980s, said 95 percent of his cases used to be middle-aged men in white-collar jobs, but now about 20 percent are women.      Japan has no legal limits on working hours, but the labor ministry recognizes two types of karoshi: death from cardiovascular illness linked to overwork, and suicide following work-related mental stress.      A cardiovascular death is likely to be considered karoshi if an employee worked 100 hours of overtime in the month beforehand, or 80 hours of overtime in two or more consecutive months in the previous six.      A suicide could qualify if it follows an individual’s working 160 hours or more of overtime in one month or more than 100 hours of overtime for three consecutive months.      Work-related suicides are up 45 percent in the past four years among those 29 and younger, and up 39 percent among women, labor ministry data show.      TWO-TIER WORKFORCE      Road workers prepare a construction site at night in central Tokyo November 30, 2015. REUTERS/Thomas Peter      The problem has become more acute as Japan’s workforce has divided into two distinct categories - regular employees, and those on temporary or non-standard contracts, frequently women and younger people.      In 2015 non-regular employees made up 38 percent of the workforce, up from 20 percent in 1990, and 68 percent of them were women.      Lawyers and academic say unscrupulous employers operate a “bait-and-switch” policy, advertising a full-time position with reasonable working hours, but later offering the successful applicant a non-regular contract with longer hours, sometimes overnight or weekends, with no overtime pay.      Refusing overtime pay and break time are illegal, and the applicant could refuse the job, but activists say companies tell them they will be given regular contracts after six months or so.      They say young applicants often accept due to lack of experience, while women trying to re-enter the workforce after childbirth often feel it would be difficult to get a foothold elsewhere.      Emiko Teranishi, head of the Families Dealing with Karoshi support group, said she hears lots of complaints about hiring tactics, with some companies telling new hires that their salary includes 80 hours of overtime, and they must reimburse the company if they work less.      “Some people don’t even make minimum wage under this system,” said Teranishi, whose own husband committed suicide after working long hours.      Such abuses have become so common in the past 10 years that such companies have been dubbed “black” companies in the media.      Hirokazu Ouchi, a professor at Chukyo University, wrote a book last year about such companies when he realized some of his students were being treated illegally at their part-time jobs.      Ouchi said their hiring practices typically follow a similar pattern.      “Companies will hire someone for two to three years, but they have no intention of investing the time or the money to nurture that employee,” said Ouchi.      He added that the labor ministry lacked the manpower to follow up on complaints.      A ministry official working in corporate surveillance acknowledged that his department was somewhat short-staffed but the government was taking steps to recruit more every year. He declined to give his name as he is not authorized to speak to the media.      Slideshow (4 Images)      Japan’s working-age population has been falling since the mid-1990s, which would normally lead companies to improve working conditions to attract workers, but Ouchi said it was not happening because they can get away with bending the rules.      “This is a way for companies to keep labor costs down, but it is also a path that leads to death by overwork,” he said.

According to the Japan Times, labour demand, at 1.28 jobs per applicant, is at its highest since 1991.

(iStockphoto)      For decades now, the modern worker has been urged to slow down, chill out, de-stress. Doctors link long shifts and on-the-job anxiety to high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and stroke. Many think the consequences can be fatal. In Japan, the government compensates families who lose loved ones to employment-related exhaustion or suicide. The Japanese call this phenomenon karoshi, or death by overwork.      Yet, so far, the connection between job strain and bad health has mostly been correlational — we haven't known whether stressful jobs directly cause our health to deteriorate. Surveys show that people who work more are more likely to suffer from hypertension and more likely to experience a stroke. The plausible biological explanation: Both of these health problems are symptoms of stress and sleep deprivation.      But what if it wasn’t the job’s fault? What if naturally obsessive or anxious people gravitate to occupations where they are forced to work too much? What if the people who volunteer for overtime only do it because they need the money to solve some other crisis in their life? The connection between bad health and overwork, as common sense as it seems, is cloudy.      [How work-life balance became work all the time]      Recently, economists at Purdue and the University of Copenhagen made a clever attempt to clear up the question. They looked at Danish manufacturing companies where overseas sales increased unexpectedly because of changes in foreign demand or transportation costs between 1996 and 2006. These constituted a set of natural experiments. At firms where exports spiked, there was suddenly a lot more work to do, a lot more things to sell. This put the squeeze on employees, who became measurably more productive — but also started to have more health problems.      “The medical literature typically finds that people who work longer hours have worse health outcomes — but we try to distinguish between causality and correlation,” said Chong Xiang, an economics professor at Purdue and co-author on the paper, along with David Hummels and Jakob Munch. A draft was released this week by the National Bureau for Economic Research.      This kind of study could only be done in a place such as Denmark, where the single-payer health care system keeps track of everyone’s doctor’s visits and drug purchases. Researchers found that women at companies where there was an export boom were subsequently more likely to be treated for severe depression, and more likely to take prescription medication for heart attack or stroke. For both men and women, there was also an increase in severe on-the-job injuries.      The health effect was related to how much pressure the company faced. If external forces caused a company’s exports to rise by, say, 10 percent, female employees were about 2.5 percent more likely to be treated for severe depression, and 7.7 percent more likely to take heart attack or stroke drugs. For context, about 4 percent of women overall were being treated for severe depression and 1 percent of women were on heart attack or stroke medication. These conditions are not very common, but job strain caused a measurable, statistically significant bump in prevalence. The researchers aren’t sure why men weren’t measurably affected, but it could have something to do with how women are at higher risk in general for stroke or depression in their lifetimes. And the men could have been sicker in other ways that the researchers couldn’t observe.      [The definitive guide to whether or not a robot will take your job]      At companies that experienced the biggest increases in exports, the rate of serious injury also went up. These were on-the-job accidents severe enough to merit an insurance payout from the Danish government. (Such cases are rare, about 4 in 1,000 workers.) If you sorted companies by how big of an export boost they experienced, and focused on the top 25 percent, these exceptionally busy firms saw a 28-percent increase in severe injuries — which translates to about 1 extra-serious injury per 1,000 workers. Most of these injuries seemed to be concentrated in positions involving physical labor, not white-collar work.      The researchers also found interesting patterns involving sick days. At most firms, employees started taking fewer sick days after business picked up, which indicates that they felt pressured to come in even if they weren’t feeling well.      But at companies that became exceptionally busy — those that enjoyed an export boost ranking in the top 25 percent — the number of sick days per person actually increased, by 14 percent for men and 24 percent for women. At these places, it seems the pressure was too much and the overwork made people too sick to come in. (The researchers focused on sick days that occurred in conjunction with a doctor’s visit or a drug prescription.)      We should always be careful of studies that so neatly confirm our assumptions, but here the conclusion aligns with decades of medical research hinting at similar things. We’ve known for a while that overwork and job stress is associated with poor health; it was just unethical to run an experiment to prove that one causes the other.      In this case, we can blame (or thank) the invisible hand for doing the dirty work. The more or less random fluctuations in foreign economies provided an opportunity to observe what happens when people suddenly get a lot busier at work. Though this study focused on the Danish manufacturing sector, it covered both blue and white collar workers, so the results seem generalizable enough: Working too hard has health consequences.

This persistent issue is rooted in the nation's working culture, beginning in the '70s when Japanese employees sought to maximize earnings in a period of low wages and continuing through economic booms and busts. Japan's basic workweek is 40 hours; however, due to fear of getting bad performance evaluations, many workers do not claim extra hours. This working culture resulted in \\"karoshi,\\" which, shockingly, is a recognized cause of death in Japan due to either stroke, a fatal heart attack, or suicide triggered by overwork. The labor ministry revealed that 189 deaths were categorized this way last year, though experts speculate actual numbers could be in the thousands. Even though the Japanese government passed legislation 18 months ago to address the problem, experts argue it doesn't tackle the core issue, and that the country's working culture itself needs to change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Q:Information:  - Surra (from the Marathi \\"sra\\", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \\"Trypanosoma evansi\\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated.  - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus \\"Trypanosoma\\".  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.  - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...  - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad.  - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\".  - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi . It is classified under EC 3.4.22.51 .  - In organic chemistry, a thiol is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl or sulphydryl (CSH or RSH) group (where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of \\"thion\\" + \\"alcohol,\\" with the first word deriving from Greek  (\\"theion\\") = \\"sulfur\\".

Answer:","output":"Grand Forks International Airport (GFK) and McCarran International Airport (LAS) are not both located in the Midwest United States. The two airports are situated in different regions of the country and serve different catchment areas. Grand Forks International Airport (GFK) is located near the city of Grand Forks, in the state of North Dakota. This places it within the region commonly referred to as the Midwest. The Midwest is a collection of states in the north-central part of the United States, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. This region is characterized by its agricultural and industrial activities, as well as a strong sense of cultural heritage dating back to the pioneer days of America's westward expansion. GFK plays a vital role in connecting the cities and communities in and around North Dakota to the larger national and international transportation network. On the other hand, McCarran International Airport (LAS) is located in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. This places it not in the Midwest but rather in the western United States, specifically in a region known as the Southwest. The Southwest region generally encompasses the states of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and parts of California, Colorado, and Texas. This region is characterized by its arid and desert-like climate, vast expanses of open space, and unique geological features such as the Grand Canyon and the Great Basin. LAS is a major commercial airport, serving millions of passengers from around the world each year. Las Vegas is a renowned travel destination in its own right, attracting visitors for its casino resorts, nightlife, entertainment events, conventions, and natural beauty in the surrounding area. In summary, while Grand Forks International Airport is located in the Midwest US, McCarran International Airport is not. The latter is situated in the Southwest region of the United States.

Question: What is the last name of the person who had three operas survive with their music and librettos intact?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived.

Please answer a question about the following article about Unicode: Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and the now-obsolete UCS-2. UTF-8 uses one byte for any ASCII character, all of which have the same code values in both UTF-8 and ASCII encoding, and up to four bytes for other characters. UCS-2 uses a 16-bit code unit (two 8-bit bytes) for each character but cannot encode every character in the current Unicode standard. UTF-16 extends UCS-2, using one 16-bit unit for the characters that were representable in UCS-2 and two 16-bit units (4 × 8 bits) to handle each of the additional characters. How are two 16-bit units used?","output":"In Unicode, two 16-bit units are used to encode a character in a process known as \\"UTF-16 surrogate pairs\\". This allows representation of characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of Unicode, which is the range of characters that can be represented using a single 16-bit unit. To better understand how two 16-bit units are used, let's first look at some background information: 1. Unicode assigns each character a unique code point, ranging from 0x0000 to 0x10FFFF. 2. The BMP comprises the first 65,536 (0x0000 to 0xFFFF) code points, which can be represented by a single 16-bit unit. 3. There are 1,048,576 (0x10000 to 0x10FFFF) code points outside the BMP, referred to as Supplementary Unicode characters or \\"Astral characters.\\" UTF-16 uses the following process to represent characters with two 16-bit units: 1. For characters within the BMP (0x0000 to 0xFFFF), UTF-16 uses a single 16-bit unit that directly corresponds to the Unicode code point. 2. For characters outside the BMP (0x10000 to 0x10FFFF), UTF-16 utilizes a pair of 16-bit units called \\"surrogate pairs\\":    a. The first 16-bit unit, known as the \\"high surrogate\\" or \\"leading surrogate\\", falls within the range 0xD800 to 0xDBFF.    b. The second 16-bit unit, called the \\"low surrogate\\" or \\"trailing surrogate\\", falls within the range 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF. To encode a character outside the BMP using two 16-bit units, UTF-16 follows these steps: 1. Subtract 0x10000 from the Unicode code point of the character to obtain a 20-bit value. 2. Split the 20-bit value into two parts: the upper 10 bits and the lower 10 bits. 3. Add 0xD800 to the upper 10 bits to determine the high surrogate. 4. Add 0xDC00 to the lower 10 bits to determine the low surrogate. The result is a surrogate pair comprised of two 16-bit units. The high surrogate appears first, followed by the low surrogate. When decoding a UTF-16 encoded character, the reverse process is followed: retrieve the high and low surrogates, subtract the appropriate base values, and reassemble them into a complete Unicode code point. In summary, UTF-16 encoding uses two 16-bit units, or surrogate pairs, to represent characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. This allows encoding of the full range of Unicode characters by splitting the 20-bit value into two 10-bit parts and adding specific values to form the high and low surrogates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Pankaj Advani was born on 24 July 1985 in Pune, India. Advani spent his initial years in Kuwait before moving to Bangalore, India. He received his education at the Frank Anthony Public School, Bangalore and completed his bachelor's degree in Commerce from Sri Bhagawan Mahaveer Jain College. He received training in snooker from former national Snooker champion Arvind Savur. Pankaj Advani, on international competitive debut in the discipline, won the IBSF World Snooker Championship (i.e. the World Amateur Snooker Championship) on 25 October 2003 in Jiangmen, China. He was 18 years old, and became the youngest Indian to win the title, his first world title. A decade later, as a 28-year-old, at the IBSF World 6-Red World Snooker Championship in Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt, he won one of the amateur world titles (on debut in the short format).  As a new player on the tour, Advani would need to win four matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events. He did this in just his fourth attempt, when qualifying for the International Championship. He defeated Craig Steadman 6-1, six-time world champion Steve Davis 6-5 (after being 1-4 down), Alan McManus 6-3 and Michael Holt 6-4 to reach the venue stage for the first time. He made four century breaks during qualification, the most of any player. Advani was to play a wildcard match once at the tournament in Chengdu, China, to reach the last 32, however he decided to withdraw from the tournament to take part in the World Billiards Championship, which he went on to win. He also reached the semi-finals of the minor ranking European Tour Event 1, beating four-time world champion John Higgins 4-1 along the way. Advani lost to Mark Selby 2-4. Advani played in eight of the ten of these Players Tour Championship events and finished 40th on the Order of Merit.  At the 2013 Welsh Open, he became the first Indian player to reach the quarter-final stage of a ranking event with a 4-1 win over Graeme Dott in the last 16, but lost 2-5 to Judd Trump. Advani's season ended when he was beaten 8-10 by Joe Swail in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. He was ranked world number 74 after his first year on the main snooker tour. Has he ever competed in the US?","output":"The article doesn't mention if Pankaj Advani has competed in the US. It talks about his competitions in China, Egypt, and some other countries, but not the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

(CNN) Sometimes a historic moment arrives like an IMAX movie: a big, loud, jarring event that bends the arc of history. Other times, though, it sneaks up on people. It seems modest at the time, but only later do Americans realize it marked a turning point -- that something new had burst onto the national stage and the old rules no longer applied. Did President Barack Obama have such a moment this week when he wept openly about children killed by gun violence? Some say yes, and that Obama's tears were more radical than people realize. Most people know the backdrop: While announcing executive orders Tuesday to strengthen gun control laws, Obama halted as the cameras clicked. He tried to regain his composure, but then the tears flowed as he talked about 20 schoolchildren murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.Obama's tears during his gun control speech were revolutionary, several historians and political scientists sayHe became the \\"father-in-chief,\\" shedding tears over the deaths of white children, they sayHe also showed it was OK for men -- and political leaders -- to cry in public   Question:\\"He's us, and in many ways, that's _'s greatest triumph.\\" A:","output":"Part 1: Write an implausible answer.

Usage: \\"He's us, and in many ways, that's basketball's greatest triumph.\\" This response is incorrect but not out of context because basketball is related to Obama, who is known to enjoy the sport, but it is not the correct answer.  Part 3: Related words to the context of the passage. Usage: \\"He's us, and in many ways, that's politics' greatest triumph.\\" This response meets the criteria as politics is related to the context of the passage, but it is not the correct answer since the passage implies that the moment of tears was a breakthrough in the perception of political leaders showing emotions."},{"instruction":"I heard that Kai tried to cheer up his friend who just broke up with his girlfriend but he did not laugh.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Pick from: +Avoid eating in bed. Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed.; +Avoid sleeping in bed. Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed.;","output":"The more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning would be: +Avoid eating in bed. Wash your sheets regularly and avoid putting items under your bed. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. Avoid eating in bed: Eating in bed might attract spiders because it can lead to crumbs or leftovers which can, in turn, attract insects that spiders prey upon. Therefore, by not eating in bed, you can reduce the chances of attracting spiders. 2. Wash sheets regularly: By washing your sheets regularly, you eliminate possible insect eggs, bodies of tiny insects, or food particles that could attract spiders. 3. Avoid placing items under the bed: Items under the bed can create perfect hiding and breeding spots for spiders. By avoiding placing items under your bed, you can limit the possible spaces that spiders could inhabit. Whereas, \\"avoid sleeping in bed\\" is an impractical method of keeping spiders away. It does not address the source of the spider issue and simply vacating your own bed doesn't deter spiders or reduce their populations. This suggestion seems based more on fear or dislike of spiders than any sound scientific reasoning.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees).

On the other hand, the statement \\"A woman sits at a table.\\" only provides baseline information without any additional specifics. This statement does not give any information about the woman's ethnicity, the color of the table, or what the woman is wearing, but it still accurately conveys the essential action taking place: a woman sitting at a table. Thus, while the two statements differ in the level of detail they provide, the core message remains the same. In both instances, a woman is seated at a table, which is the key information being communicated. Consequently, the statement \\"A woman sits at a table.\\" can be considered a more simplified and generalized version of the original statement provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would case A have higher or lower air pressure above it than case B?  Hint: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. The answer is:","output":"Case A would have lower air pressure above it than case B.  This is because, in case A (airplane wing), the air flows more quickly and has lower air pressure above the wing, which creates lift, allowing the airplane to rise against gravity. In case B (race car spoiler), the air flows more slowly and has higher air pressure above the spoiler, which pushes the car downward, providing better traction on the track."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Report cyberbullying. Stay safe.","output":"Title: Staying One Step Ahead: How to Effectively Deal with Cyberbullying  Introduction In today's hyper-connected world, interactions with people across the globe have become the norm. Our lives are rapidly being shaped by technology, and we are more dependent on it than ever before. While these advancements have made our lives more convenient, they have also opened doors for new forms of harassment, most notably, cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can manifest in various forms, from harassing messages to public shaming. It is essential to know how to use technology to your advantage, counteract such situations, and stay safe. In this article, we will discuss some effective strategies for dealing with cyberbullying. 1. Use Technology to Your Advantage Oftentimes, the tools we utilize in our everyday lives can be our first line of defense against cyberbullying. By educating ourselves on the different tools and settings available on social media platforms, messaging apps, and online games, we can take control and minimize the risk of encountering a cyberbully. Some techniques include: - Adjust privacy settings to limit who can view your profile or send you messages. This narrowing of your online network can help prevent unsolicited interactions and comments. - Utilize content filters to block certain words or phrases from appearing in your comments and messages. This can deter cyberbullies from sending harmful language. - Use tools such as Google Alerts to notify you of whenever your name or personal information is mentioned online. This way, you can monitor and quickly address any potential cases of cyberbullying. 2. Don't Feed the Trolls One of the most common pieces of advice given to those dealing with cyberbullies is to ignore them, as responding can often fuel their behaviors. Cyberbullies seek attention and want to elicit a reaction from their targets. By not engaging with them, you deplete their power. Stay calm and resist the urge to \\"fight back\\" or defend yourself. If the attack persists, consider blocking the individual or stepping away from your device for a while, allowing time for your emotions to settle. 3. Record Evidence Keeping a record of cyberbullying incidents serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it helps you keep track of events and patterns in case you need to report the incident. Secondly, it provides concrete evidence of the harassment for authorities, schools, or internet service providers. Take screenshots of troubling messages, posts, or comments and store them in a secure location. Remember to include the date, time, and any other relevant details about the incidents. 4. Report Cyberbullying In many cases, it is crucial to report cyberbullying incidents to the appropriate parties. This can include school administrators, platform moderators, or even local authorities if necessary. By reporting these events, you help ensure that the bully is held responsible for their actions and that steps are taken to stop further harassment. However, it's also important to evaluate the situation carefully, and only escalate if you or someone else's safety is at stake. 5. Stay Safe Your primary objective should always be to prioritize your safety and well-being. This means staying aware of your boundaries and knowing when to take a break from online activities. Furthermore, it is key to develop a support network that can provide assistance should you encounter a cyberbully. This could include friends, family, or even dedicated organizations such as helplines or online groups that focus on dealing with cyberbullies. Remember, you don't have to face this challenge alone. Conclusion Dealing with cyberbullying can be emotionally and mentally draining. However, by arming yourself with knowledge, utilizing the tools available to you, and knowing your limits, you can effectively combat these harmful behaviors and safeguard your well-being. Always remember to stay vigilant, do not engage with the aggressor, record evidence, report incidents when necessary, and prioritize your safety. Together, we can create a safer and more respectful online environment for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Entertainment Software Association reckons that nearly one third of all Americans will give a computer game as a Christmas gift in 2004.","output":"The topic discussed in the given text is about the popularity of video games as Christmas gifts in America.  To delve into the topic, it revolves around the growing culture of video games in the United States and their relevance in gift-giving scenarios, specifically around Christmas time. The information primarily derives from a predictive statistic from the Entertainment Software Association. The Entertainment Software Association is the main association representing computer and video game publishers in the United States.  Looking at the specifics, the text provides a forecast for the year 2004, seeming to be an influential year for the industry, given that nearly a third of all Americans were projected to give a computer game as a Christmas gift. This increase in giving digital gifts illustrates the evolving perception and acceptance of video games as viable and appreciated gifts. Previously, traditional gifts such as toys, books or clothes have dominated the Christmas gift-giving culture. The shift towards digital gifts, particularly computer games, could be attributed to the rise of information technology and digital media over the years. Moreover, this also reflects the influence of technology on social behaviors and traditions. The fact that computer games have become a popular choice for gift-giving indicates the changing dynamics of gift-giving itself. It reveals how the traditional act of gifting, once involving physical commodities, has been transformed into an exchange of digital goods, reflecting the embracing of newer forms of entertainment in everyday life. In summary, the topic revolves around the popularization of computer games as a preferred choice of Christmas gifts amongst Americans in the year 2004. It delves into the transformation of traditional gifting patterns and the increasing acceptance of digital entertainment as a common aspect of American culture, particularly as Christmastime approaches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Hut Point and Cape Evans huts remain, protected by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and the New Zealand government. Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America.  She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider.  Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.  He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.  Wild and Victor Hayward received the same award, posthumously. Many of the survivors enjoyed long and successful careers.

Movie title: Good Morning, Vietnam Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1965, Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) arrives in Saigon from Crete to work as a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. Cronauer is greeted by Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker). Cronauer's irreverence contrasts sharply with many staff members and soon rouses the ire of two of his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor (Noble Willingham) and the other DJs quickly grow to like the new man and his brand of comedy. Cronauer's show consists of unpredictable humor segments mixed with news updates (vetted by the station censors) and rock and roll records that are frowned upon by his superiors. Cronauer meets Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a Vietnamese girl, and follows her to an English class. Bribing the teacher to let him take over the job, Cronauer starts instructing the students in the use of American slang. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan. Instead, Cronauer befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, the local GI bar, to have drinks with Garlick and the station staff. Two other soldiers, angered at Tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that Cronauer escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for this incident, but his broadcasts continue as before. While relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, he is pulled outside by Tuan, who says that Trinh likes him and wants to see him, moments before the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer badly shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; the news is censored, but... A:","output":"Based on the film synopsis you provided for \\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\\" there were two soldiers killed as a result of the building explosion. This occurs during a scene where the main character, Adrian Cronauer, is relaxing at a local GI bar named Jimmy Wah's. He gets taken outside by Tuan, Trinh's brother who he had befriended, moments before the building explodes. This incident leaves Cronauer greatly affected both physically and emotionally. As for your initial question about whether investing in this film proposal is a good idea, a number of factors need to be considered. Since \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" is an already-established film (released in 1987), if the proposal is to remount or remake this movie, consider the success of the original film first. The original was critically acclaimed and well received by audiences, with a highly memorable performance by Robin Williams. It served as a unique combination of dramatic wartime storytelling with humor and satire. Therefore, if the idea is to remake this film, comparisons will undoubtedly be made to its predecessor. It's essential to ensure that the new adaptation will possess a fresh perspective or a modern take that resonates with today's audience, while still preserving the elements which made the initial release successful. This includes a strong script, engaging performances, nuanced direction, and perhaps a thoughtful examination of war and its effects through relevant, contemporary lenses. Moreover, consider the current landscape of movies and whether a war-time film balances between drama and humor like \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" does will attract modern audiences. Will the themes appeal or resonate with them? Is there potential for this kind of story in the global market? Additionally, it's also worth considering the financial aspect such as the proposed budget, potential returns, marketing strategy, and distribution plan.  And don't forget the production team and cast. One of the main attractions of the original film was the performances of the actors, most notably Robin Williams. It'd be important to attach actors who can draw audience as well as deliver strong performances. Also, consider whether the director and production crew are capable of delivering the vision for the movie. Overall, this is a decision that requires careful thought and research. If you can consider these angles and confidently see the potential success, then it may be worth investing in. Then again, every investment carries a risk and in the unpredictable world of filmmaking, there can never be guarantees of success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The chloroplasts contained within the green algal endosymbionts still are capable of photosynthesis, making chlorarachniophytes photosynthetic. The green algal endosymbiont also exhibits a stunted vestigial nucleus. In fact, it appears that chlorarachniophytes are the products of an evolutionarily recent secondary endosymbiotic event. The plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes: The first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium, the third corresponds to the green alga, and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor. In other lineages that involved secondary endosymbiosis, only three membranes can be identified around plastids. This is currently rectified as a sequential loss of a membrane during the course of evolution. The process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes. In fact, secondary endosymbiosis of green algae also led to euglenid protists, whereas secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to the evolution of dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and stramenopiles.

Aston Martin's Vanquish Zagato Is the Most Beautiful Car of 2016 Aston Martin has just unveiled what gets my vote for the most beautiful car of the year: the Vanquish Zagato Concept. The British auto brand and the Italian coach builder have designed five cars together, dating back to the DB4 GT Zagato in 1960. This is their first since the V12 Vantage Zagato, in 2013. This is the fifth car that the British auto brand and the Italian design house have made together. The concept was developed at Aston headquarters in Gaydon, England. The new bodywork is made entirely of carbon fiber, and fresh proportions give it a stance that’s more aggressively styled than its production counterpart. The concept was developed at Aston headquarters in Gaydon, England; interior work was conceived in Milan. In fact, the car combines the best elements of just about every Aston Martin model. The Vanquish Zagato Concept has new lights and round tail reflectors that make it look like a classic Zagato, but this year’s version also uses the supermodern “bladed” LED lights it debuted on the track-only Aston Martin Vulcan. Its winglike mirrors are inspired by the One-77 Aston; its sculpted rear and retractable spoiler evoke the best assets of the DB11. It comes with a retractable rear spoiler and two slight “bubbles” in the roofline. That subtle double indentation dipping into the rear-window glass—the so-called double bubble—is a throwback to 1950 Zagato models, which required extra space above the seats to accommodate racing helmets without ruining the entire aerodynamic profile of the car. Winglike mirrors and sculpted sides are inspired by the One-77. Like the limited-edition Vantage GTS I drove last week, it has a quad-exhaust format and carbon-fiber sills that circle the lower part of the car. The windshield and side mirrors blur into one glass frame that wraps around the front of the car; the sides run from wheel arches to doors in the design first introduced by the CC100. It’s a lot to take in. The windshield wraps around the car from side to side like the cockpit on a private jet. Inside, Aston has added herringbone-patterned carbon fiber with leather and “Z” quilt stitching on the headrest, seats, center console, and door sections. The V12 engine is boosted to 600ps (592hp), with enhanced engine systems and chassis dynamics that make driving the thing almost as exciting as just looking at it. But I’m guessing you were already sold on this car without needing to know that. Aston has added herringbone-patterned carbon fiber with leather and “Z” quilt stitching on the headrest, seats, center console, and door sections. Unfortunately, Aston hasn’t confirmed prospective pricing on the car, or even whether it’ll actually make any of them. (The 2013 Aston Martin V12 Zagato cost roughly 450,000.) So start saying your prayers now. The world needs more beautiful machines, and this one looks downright heavenly. Aston did not respond to questions regarding when—if ever—it will produce the Vanquish Zagato Concept. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Aston Martin, a British car company, has just revealed a new car called the Vanquish Zagato Concept, which some people think is the most beautiful car of the year 2016.  This car is special because it's the fifth time Aston Martin has collaborated with an Italian design company called Zagato. They've been making cars together since way back in 1960! This new Vanquish Zagato Concept was built in England, at Aston Martin's headquarters. The body of the car is made completely out of something called carbon fiber, which is a very strong and light material.  The car has features from many other Aston Martin models, like a special type of light called a \\"bladed\\" LED light which was first used on the Aston Martin Vulcan, a race car. The car even has a little \\"double bubble\\" dip in the rear window. This bubble is a cool design trick from the 1950s that was used to create extra space for the racing helmets without changing the car's shape too much. Inside the car, there's a special zig-zag pattern stitched into the seats, doors, and other parts. The car is also very powerful and has a big engine that can produce 592 horsepower! However, we don't know if Aston Martin will actually make this car for people to buy, or how much it would cost. The previous car they made with Zagato in 2013 cost about 450,000!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: \\"Which is not a specific person: Timur, Sikander Lodi, or Vedic?\\"  Context: \\"The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the Indus valley civilisation flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.\\"  Answer:","output":"In the context provided, Vedic is not a specific person, while Timur and Sikander Lodi are historical figures. Timur, also known as Tamerlane, was a Turkic-Mongol conqueror and the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia. He ruled from 1370 to 1405, and his conquests spread across West, South, and Central Asia, as well as parts of Eastern Europe. Timur was known for his military prowess, and his invasions significantly impacted the regions he conquered, including the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh. Sikander Lodi, born as Nizam Khan, was the second ruler of the Lodi Dynasty, ruling from 1489 to 1517. His given name was Sikander, which means \\"Alexander\\" and alludes to Alexander the Great. He was known for his administrative and military skills, as well as his passion for poetry and literature. Sikander Lodi expanded the Delhi Sultanate's territory and conquered several hill states in the area now known as Himachal Pradesh during his reign. The term \\"Vedic\\" refers to the Vedic period in the Indian subcontinent, which lasted from approximately 1500 to 500 BCE. This period was marked by the composition of the sacred Hindu texts called the Vedas, which formed the basis of Hinduism's religious, cultural, and philosophical development. The term \\"Vedic\\" does not denote a specific person; rather, it describes a historic era and the cultural aspects associated with it. In the context of the history of Himachal Pradesh, the region witnessed the rise and fall of various empires, including the Gupta Empire and the Delhi Sultanate. The Vedic period played a significant role in shaping the religious and cultural identity of the region, while historical figures like Timur and Sikander Lodi exerted their influence through conquests and battles in the lower hills of the state."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- In spite of heightened security due to a terror threat on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks, a South Carolina man was apparently able to sneak a stun gun into a professional football game and fired it into the crowd, police said Tuesday.  Leroy T. McKelvey, 59, allegedly used the gun on three men in an upperdeck scuffle at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during a Sunday match-up between the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys, according to New Jersey Police Sgt. Julian Castellanos.  The three men suffered minor injuries, he said.  McKelvey was charged with three counts of aggravated assault, possession of a stun gun and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.  He was taken to Bergen County Jail and later released on 22,500 bail. McKelvey could not immediately be reached for comment.  When asked about the security breach, National Football League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league is \\"always refining and improving our security procedures.\\"  \\"These procedures have been successful in keeping items that can cause serious injuries out of our stadiums,\\" he said in a statement. \\"We will continue to be vigilant in protecting the safety of our fans.\\"  Mark Lamping, the chief executive of MetLife Stadium, said the stun gun involved in the incident was the size of a small cell phone.  \\"Procedures for pat downs established by the NFL and used at every game were in effect at all entry gates,\\" he said in a statement.

Movie title: Firefox Movie plot: MIG-31 Firefox A joint Anglo-American plot is devised to steal a highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft (MiG-31, NATO code name \\"Firefox\\") which is capable of Mach 6, is invisible to radar, and carries weapons controlled by thought. Former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood), a Vietnam veteran and former POW, infiltrates the Soviet Union, aided by his ability to speak Russian (due to his having had a Russian mother) and a network of Jewish dissidents and sympathizers, three of whom are key scientists working on the fighter itself. His goal is to steal the Firefox and fly it back to friendly territory for analysis. However, the KGB has got wind of the operation and is already hot on Gant's tail. It is only through the sympathizers that Gant remains one step ahead of the KGB and reaches the air base at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox prototype is under heavy guard. The dissident scientists working on the Firefox help Gant infiltrate the base. Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne), one of the scientists, informs Gant that there is a second prototype in the hangar that must be destroyed. The diversion will allow Gant to enter the hangar and escape with the first Firefox. Gant knocks out Lt. Colonel Yuri Voskov (Kai Wulff), a Soviet pilot assigned to take the first prototype on its maiden flight during a visit from the Soviet First Secretary. The scientists attempt the destruction of the second prototype to give Gant time to suit up and start the first fighter, but the second prototype is not destroyed, and the scientists are killed by the guards. Fortunately for Gant, he escapes the hangar and lifts off just as the First Secretary arrives. Evading the Soviets' attempts to stop him, Gant barely reaches the Arctic ice pack and lands for refueling, making a rendezvous with a US submarine whose crew refuels and rearms the aircraft. However, Gant's last-minute refusal to kill Voskov has consequences; the Soviet pilot flies the second prototype, with orders to wait for him at the North Cape area.... Answer:","output":"The prototype that is under heavy guard in the movie \\"Firefox\\" is the highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft called the MiG-31, NATO code name \\"Firefox.\\" This aircraft is a groundbreaking aviation marvel as it can reach speeds of up to Mach 6, remain invisible to radar, and features weapons systems controlled by the pilot's thoughts.  The primary mission of the film's protagonist, former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant, is to infiltrate the Soviet Union and steal the Firefox aircraft from the heavily guarded air base at Bilyarsk. This task is especially challenging due to the KGB's awareness of the operation, requiring Gant to rely on a network of Jewish dissidents and sympathizers to remain one step ahead. Assisted by key dissident scientists working on the Firefox project, Gant makes his way into the Bilyarsk airbase, where he is informed by Dr. Pyotr Baranovich about the existence of a second prototype. The plan is for the second prototype to be destroyed as a diversion, enabling Gant to enter the hangar, steal the first prototype, and make his escape. Despite the subsequent failure to destroy the second prototype and the tragic deaths of the assisting scientists, Gant manages to successfully evade Soviet forces, steal the first Firefox prototype, and escape the airbase. He then endures a dangerous flight towards friendly territory, ultimately landing on the Arctic ice pack to refuel and rearm from a rendezvoused US submarine. In conclusion, the prototype under heavy guard in the movie \\"Firefox\\" is the innovative Soviet MiG-31 fighter aircraft. This dangerous mission to steal the aircraft and bring it back for analysis by the United States and its allies forms the basis of the film's thrilling plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.

He claims that he should stay and that they should watch after each other. Tom starts to dislike Silas and becomes suspicious of him and his past. Tom travels to the town police station to look for records regarding Silas after he finds a newspaper clipping about him and his father in the attic. The whole town is deserted with only flyers announcing a mandatory evacuation due to the storm. Tom is attacked by two deranged men after finding an article showing Silas as the actual killer of his father. Tom manages to fight the two men off and escape back to the farm. Upon reading the news article, it shows that Silas' father lost the farm because he was drunk and this enraged Silas so much that he hung him from a tree and left him there for days. When a bank foreclosure agent came by to foreclose on the house, Silas slit his throat as well. It is then found out that Silas has been in prison for the last 20 years related to the two deaths.

Answer the following question: Background: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  Paragraph: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island burned less fossil fuels? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, Sand Island burned less fossil fuels in comparison to Grey Island. The text indicates that both islands contributed to global warming through their actions, but Grey Island contributed significantly more due to their carelessness.

You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story. Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story.

A:","output":"Part #1: You're given the title and three arbitrary sentences out of a five-sentence story. Usage: In this scenario, the title is \\"The other workers kept guessing the wrong items.\\" and the three sentences given are: \\"After 4 mistakes the system wouldn't let Kate complete the hit.\\", \\"She decided to quit working on chat hits.\\". This is satisfying this particular part of the task as it gives a title and three separate sentences which comprise parts of a five-sentence story. Part #2: You are also given three additional sentence options, a, b, and c, that may or may not belong to the story.  Usage: The three options given are \\"I can't wait to watch another game with my friend again.\\", \\"Kate was forced to return the hit.\\", \\"Kate was working on chats hits on Mturk.\\" Here, each option may potentially fit into the existing story or maybe completely unrelated. Part #3: Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their respective positions in the sentence order. Usage: After evaluating the sentence options, you might decide that options 'b' and 'c' seem to fit best with the given title and sentences because they reference \\"Kate\\", \\"hit\\", and \\"chat hits\\", recurring themes throughout the snippets. Part #4: Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. Usage: You decide that 'b' would best fit as the second sentence (\\"Kate was forced to return the hit.\\") and 'c' as the 4th sentence (\\"Kate was working on chats hits on Mturk.\\") to provide context for Kate's actions. Thus, your answer would be '2b, 4c', following the provided format.  Part #5: The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices; the sentence's chronological order should reflect in the answer.  Usage: You could not answer '4c, 2b', even if 'c' and 'b' are the options you picked. Here, the format '2b, 4c' satisfies the requirement as it places the events in the correct sequence. Part #6: If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense. Usage: Suppose option 'a' also has some relation to the story, but it doesn't fit logically into the context as well as 'b' and 'c'. In that case, you'd go with 'b' and 'c' - they make more sense within the given context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them.  I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something.  \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost.  This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off.  No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound.  Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus.  Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did.  But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by.  I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one.  Then I gave up.  I decided to walk on to the next stop.

Solve 865 = -14*k + 585 for k.","output":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're explaining this to a five-year-old. We are trying to find the value of \\"k\\" in this problem. Here is the equation: 865 = -14*k + 585 First, we want to move the 585 from the right side of the equation to the left side. We can do that by subtracting 585 from both sides. It will look like this: 865 - 585 = -14*k Now, let's do the math: 865 - 585 = 280. So now we have: 280 = -14*k Next, we want to get the \\"k\\" all by itself. To do that, we need to take the -14 and move it to the other side of the equation. We can do that by dividing both sides by -14. Like this: 280 / -14 = k Now, let's divide: 280 / -14 = -20. So, the value of \\"k\\" is -20. And that's the solution to the math problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Premise: EPA has concluded that it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis because the rule only affects motor vehicle manufacturers, a group that is not comprised of a substantial number of small businesses. Hypothesis: Motor vehicle manufacturers are not a group that has a lot of small businesses. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Pick from:  *yes  *it is not possible to tell  *no And the answer is:","output":"*yes The hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise. If we dissect the premise, it starts off by stating that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has concluded it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis. This raises the question of why such an analysis would be unnecessary. The answer is given in the succeeding portion of the premise, stating it is because the rule only affects motor vehicle manufacturers, and that this group is not comprised of a substantial number of small businesses. This, in essence, summaries the hypothesis, which states: \\"Motor vehicle manufacturers are not a group that has a lot of small businesses\\". Therefore, the hypothesis is supported and verified by the premise. Moreover, the types of businesses that the rule is affecting – motor vehicle manufacturers – are not typically small businesses due to the high costs associated with the production and manufacturing of vehicles. Large financial resources are needed for such activities as research, development, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and servicing of vehicles. These high costs and complexities create a barrier to entry for small businesses into the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. The premise infers that since there isn't a substantial number of small businesses, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary. A regulatory flexibility analysis is generally required to assess the impact of any proposed or final regulation on small businesses. However, with the motor vehicle manufacturers not being comprised of a substantial number of small businesses, the impact would be minimal or non-existent, resulting in the EPA's decision to forego the analysis. In conclusion, the premise directly links and supports the hypothesis. It clearly states that the group (motor vehicle manufacturers) is not composed of many small businesses, precisely as the hypothesis asserts, establishing a clear verification and thus indicating that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

However, if a situation has already involved Human Resources (such as a dispute with your manager or a harassment issue), request that a representative from Human Resources be present. It is easier to request a face to face meeting if you work in the same office or can easily travel to a common location (as you may do for other meetings). If either your manager or Human Resources are not readily reachable in person, you may request a phone call or video conference. It is not essential to fly or drive over 4 hours to break the news. When requesting a meeting, say “I would like to have a short meeting with you to discuss something. When is a time good today?” You do not need to say you are leaving your job at this point. Start off by thanking anyone present for taking the time to meet with you. Then, politely express that you have chosen to leave the company. Give your last date of employment. A 2-week notice is considered customary and professional. However, if the situation is serious as with a harassment issue, you may be waived the 2 week notice requirement. When you come into a meeting with strong, upsetting emotions, it is difficult to have a productive meeting. The meeting may become high-tension and leave both parties upset. This is not the best way to leave your job. It is important to remain as calm as possible, even if it pains you to do so. This means not to discuss all the negatives about your job. Keep it simple and short by briefly stating your reasons for leaving and move on. For example, if you are leaving because a conflict with you manager, do not say, “I am leaving because my manager is mean and doesn’t understand me.\\" Instead, you can say, “I am leaving due to conflict in management style and (your manager’s name) would agree this work relationship is not working out”. You may provide constructive criticism during an exit interview. If your company does not conduct exit interviews, you can ask your manager or Human Resources if you can provide suggestions on how to improve the company. If they decline, do not insist. If the company does want to hear your suggestions: Provide valuable suggestions or constructive criticism so that the company can retain its other employees. For example, if you left because of harassment, you can say “It would be good for the employees if the company provided additional harassment training“. If you are leaving and already have a new job, it is OK to disclose the name of the new company and your new title. However, if you start discussing details such as your new responsibilities, it may seem like you are bragging and can leave a bad impression. Many jobs provide valuable knowledge and experience to help you advance your career. Even if you are leaving due to an unpleasant situation, it is important to recognize this fact and thank your manager for the opportunity. This will leave a good lasting impression. Your letter should state the basic details of your resignation. Present your resignation letter at the end of your meeting. This letter will be kept in your file and should include:  A sentence telling the company you are leaving. Your last date of employment. A thank you for the opportunity to work for the company. An example of a good resignation letter would be: “I wish to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Sales Manager. My last date of employment will be April 5, 2014. Thank you for the opportunity to gain valuable experience and I wish the company good luck in the future”.

Please answer the following question: This article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial?, what is it ?

A man and a woman are standing in front of the camera and a woman shows how to properly perform the tango. she Possible answers: 1). moves her feet in arms in a particular motion while the man does the same from a different angle.. 2). starts off using several of her hands in various positions but ends by landing hand first on the ground.. 3). begins by dancing close and then rubbernecking straight for the camera.. 4). put the baton down and head butt him and missed.. Answer:","output":"The correct continuation can have numerous possible variations based on the context available so far. In this case where a woman is shown teaching how to properly perform the tango, it is most probable that she would demonstrate a key aspect of the dance, like moving her feet and arms in a certain way. This could likely involve her dance partner, the man, as well. Therefore, a fitting continuation of the sentence could be: \\"She moves her feet and arms in a particular motion while the man does the same from a different angle.\\" The option showcases the intricate, mutual interaction at the heart of a dance like tango, where coordination and understanding between the two partners are key. This sentence demonstrates how the woman, presumably the more experienced dancer, leads the pair in their performance. It also subtly demonstrates the physicality and unique movement patterns of the tango, providing a basic understanding of what the dance involves.  In contrast, the other options either involve movements which aren't typical of the tango (landing hand first on the ground, or using a baton), or they aim for humor or absurdity (rubbernecking straight for the camera), which may not fit into the serious, instructional context suggested by the preceding sentence. Tango is a dance that's characterized by precision and passion, not by dramatic, unsophisticated moves like headbutts or falls. Therefore, it makes much more sense for the woman to be demonstrating the refined art of tango dancing, moving her limbs in carefully choreographed patterns and guiding the man to do the same from his angle. This provides a visual and practical lesson on how the dance is performed, carrying the story forward in a logical, meaningful way."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem: Solve 0*b = -7*b + 4*b for b. And the answer is...","output":"Okay little buddy, let's solve the equation step by step. We have: 0 * b = -7 * b + 4 * b First, we know that anything times 0 is 0, so left side of the equation is: 0 = -7 * b + 4 * b Now, let's look at the right side. We are combining two sets of b: minus 7 b's and plus 4 b's. If we subtract 4 from 7, we get: 0 = -3 * b To find the value of b, we need to make it alone on one side of the equation. To do that, we can divide both sides by -3: 0 / -3 = (-3 * b) / -3 0 divided by anything is still 0, so on the left side we have 0. And on the right side, -3 divided by -3 is 1. So we get: 0 = 1 * b Since 1 * b is just b, we can say: 0 = b So the answer is: b = 0.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.

Article: Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist  at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres  - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal... Question: From the passage, we know that   _  .

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having a calm weather from the ocean happens, how will it affect less waves hit the coast.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Analyze the process The process describes the interaction between waves and the coast, including how the energy from waves contributes to the movement of sediment, and the erosion and deposition of land. This process relies on the continuous energy from waves to sustain itself. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests a scenario in which calm weather occurs, potentially leading to less wave activity hitting the coast. Step 3: Assess the effects of the perturbation on the process By having a calm weather, there would likely be less wave activity, which directly affects the energy that pushes the water and sediment. This would result in the following changes: - Less sediment movement and erosion: With less wave energy, less sediment would be moved along the coastline, reducing the overall erosion effect. - Reduced water washing: As wave activity decreases, water would wash back the sediment less frequently or with less force, affecting sediment distribution and deposition. - Changes in sediment deposition: Sediment might be deposited in different patterns or at different locations, altering the makeup of the coast. Step 4: Determine the overall impact of the perturbation hypothesis on the process The perturbation hypothesis does have a direct effect on the process. Calm weather from the ocean, resulting in less wave activity, would directly influence the energy of waves hitting the coast. This change in wave energy would impact the movement of sediment, the erosion of land, and the deposition of sediment on the coast, altering the overall process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the loss to the Cardinals, the Seahawks could still clinch the NFC West at home in a Thursday night game against the San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks hoping to avenge the earlier loss to the 49ers. On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way.  49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs. Smith would take advantage by driving his team downfield and completing a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. San Francisco delivered the final blow with Smith running for an 18-yard TD on a naked bootleg with no defenders near him. The Seahawks got a 22-yard touchdown from QB Matt Hasselbeck to TE Jerramy Stevens with under two minutes left, but it wouldn't be enough as Seattle would get swept by the 49ers.

In the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Hokkien degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty.

Question: what is a forward in soccer I found the following answer on Google: A New Zealand forward (in white) takes a shot on goal against Cameroon in the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, your answer from Google isn't a complete and correct explanation of what a forward is in soccer. While it indeed shows the forward in action during a match, it does not actually explain their role or responsibilities on the pitch. A forward in soccer, also known as a striker, is a player who is primarily responsible for scoring goals. Their positioning on the field is typically towards the opposing team's goal, ahead of the other players. The main idea behind this position is to stay close to the opponent's goal to be ready for scoring opportunities. This position is often considered the most glamorous and gets a lot of attention because they are usually the game's main goal scorers. The role of a forward can be further divided into center forwards and wide forwards. A center forward usually stays centrally in the field, close to the opponent's box, trying to turn passes into a scoring opportunity. On the other hand, wide forwards (also known as wingers) ply their trade near the sidelines where they can exploit the flanks, make crosses to center forwards, or take a shot at the goal.  Forwards need certain skills to effectively execute their role. They must have excellent ball control, quick speed, strong physicality to maintain possession under pressure, and a great understanding of positioning to be at the right place at the right time. Above all, they require a keen eye for goal and be adept at finishing - whether it's a powerful shot from outside the box or a subtle touch in a one-on-one scenario with the goalkeeper. So, while the Google answer you found gives an instance of a forward in action, to understand the concept clearly, it's important to know about their role, positioning, and the required skills. At the same time, remember, the responsibilities of a forward can vary based on team strategy and the coach's instructions. Consequently, while a forward's primary job is to score goals, they are also often involved in building up play and helping in defense, especially in modern football."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were \\" \\" into buying \\"third grade\\" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Ok, let me explain this to you like you are five years old! A very, very long time ago, people called Peking Man lived near where Beijing is today. They learned how to use fire to keep warm and have light. This helped them live in one place and do more things, like cooking! After a long time, different groups of people made their homes in China and they started the Xia Dynasty. These people made pretty things out of silk and used special symbols to write. Next came the Shang Dynasty, where people made beautiful art with bronze. So, these really old groups of people in China started to learn how to live together and make beautiful things, which is the beginning of China's long and amazing history!"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Problem:The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. \\"The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business. Everything will be taken over by the new company,\\" said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. Once its ownership is finalized, the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine's shipyard facilities. Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa (23.5 million). Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US?  A. not enough information  B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US.  C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.  D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","output":"C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians. At the core of this contentious issue is the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provides the right to own or carry a gun for law-abiding citizens. This right traces its origins back to English common law, emphasizing self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to defend the state. On one side of the debate, there are gun control advocates who argue that there should be stricter laws and regulations to help reduce gun-related violence and the number of mass shootings in the country. They often point to the fact that the current system has significant loopholes. For example, background checks are not required for private sales, including those at gun shows. Additionally, certain individuals, such as convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses, and non-U.S. citizens, are banned from owning weapons, but the system to enforce this is imperfect. On the other side, gun rights advocates, including organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA), resist attempts at imposing stricter gun regulations. They view such regulations as an infringement on their constitutional rights and an ineffective solution to the problem of gun violence. They argue that responsible gun ownership is a fundamental right, and they often emphasize the importance of self-defense and protection of one's home and family. This political divide is evident in campaigns like Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day, which has garnered widespread support from civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities, while being criticized as \\"pointless\\" by the NRA and other gun rights advocates. It is important to note that many individuals have varying opinions on what should be done about shootings in the U.S., and there is no single solution that will satisfy everyone. Nonetheless, it remains clear that the politics surrounding gun rights in the United States is deeply polarized and contentious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline.

Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must carefully analyze the statement and concepts presented. The premise sets up a scenario involving reptiles and focuses on their hissing and flaring nostrils. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed trait of these reptiles - having scales. We must now determine if this hypothesis is necessarily true based on the provided premise. Let's examine the two parts of the premise. 1. The reptiles hissed: This statement provides information about the sound these reptiles were making, which indicates their potential mood or reaction to a situation. However, this piece of information does not provide any insight into whether they have scales. There are many different species of reptiles with a wide range of physical features, and many reptiles can produce hissing sounds. 2. Flaring gigantic nostrils: This part of the premise gives us some specific information about the reptiles' physical appearance, indicating that they have visibly large nostrils. Just like the hissing, this characteristic can be found in a variety of reptile species. Nonetheless, it does not necessarily imply the presence of scales as an inherent trait of these reptiles. The hypothesis states that the reptiles had scales. While it is true that many reptiles possess scales as one of their defining features, it is not necessarily true that all reptiles must have scales. In fact, there are few reptiles like some geckos that lack scales and have smooth, almost velvety skin. The presence or absence of scales is not determined or implied by the information provided in the premise. Taking the above analysis into account, it can be concluded that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only mentions the reptiles' sounds and the appearance of their nostrils, not providing any necessary connection to the presence of scales. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the reptiles had scales merely based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Partly, because it takes itself so seriously, as opposed to regular light hearted trash, this movies wants you to be emotionally involved, to feel for the characters, and to care about the alleged conspiracy. None of this ever even comes close to happening. ****MILD SPOILERS****** There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and totally non-sensical plot. 2.) Annoying style-over-substance \\"MTV\\" camerawork. 3.) Moronic characters and plot holes. Allow me to elaborate. 1.) Apparently, when this movies was being made, they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, the stigmata, or possession. So, guess what? They combined them! An aetheist gets possessed by a dead person, who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy. How a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained, nor even talked about. Now, instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives her the Stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices, carving cryptic messages on cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent guy, because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters, while talking in that cliched, harsh, \\"possessed\\" voice that we all have heard countless times. This also starts to tie into my second complaint, because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air, and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does this happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it looked \\"cool\\". 2.) This movies contains dozens of shots, in slow motion, of course, of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off, and most annoyingly, of water dripping. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Logically, the place would probably fall apart with this many holes. To sum up this complaint, towards the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to shots of water dripping, in slow motion, in reverse!! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance to anything, and once again, I'm betting it's because the director thought it looked \\"cool\\". 3.) One of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science. This doesn't make sense to me. I would think that going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest. I just don't buy it. Secondly, there are lots of plot holes, a few of which I will elaborate on below. For starters, when she first gets the stigmata, the scene ends with her laying unconscious, bleeding. Next, she's in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another one is towards the end, when the previously mentioned \\"scientific priest\\" character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl. He says, \\"Take me as your messenger!\\" Not a word for word quote, but you get the idea. His response? \\"You have no faith, only doubt!\\" So, because of this, he possesses an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, far less then any scientific priest! And then, there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy, this Lost Gospel (of St. Thomas, I believe) is available at local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to supress this document, but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it. Maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history, where it isn't wide known, but the movie never tries to tell us this, or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document's uncovering. In closing, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. It is my arch-nemesis, which I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I loathe it. Final Grade: F Choose your answer.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from DÃ¼sseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a group of outlaws for whom Dr. Schultz is carrying a warrant. Dr. Schultz, a superior gunslinger, immediately kills Ace with a Fast draw. Dr. Schultz insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him at the mercy of the newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Dr. Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down. After tracking and killing the Brittles to a plantation owned by Spencer \\"Big Daddy\\" Bennett (Don Johnson), the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice. They are also briefly hunted by Big Daddy but Dr. Schutlz deceives and kills most of his gang with an explosive in their carriage, as Django kills Big Daddy himself, his first kill.

SpaceX's robotic Dragon capsule lifts off the pad atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket on Oct. 7, 2012, kicking off the first-ever bona fide supply run for a private American spaceship.      This story was updated at 10:46 p.m. ET.      CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – A privately built rocket lit up the night sky over Florida Sunday (Oct. 7) to kick off the first-ever cargo delivery trip to the International Space Station by a robotic, American-made spacecraft.      The unmanned Dragon space capsule, built by the commercial spaceflight firm SpaceX, roared into space atop the company's Falcon 9 rocket from a launch pad here at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, beginning a three-day flight to the space station. Liftoff occurred at 8:35 p.m. EDT (0035 Monday GMT).      The mission is the first of a dozen SpaceX cargo flights under a 1.6 billion deal with NASA for its Commercial Resupply Services program. This flight, being the first mission, is dubbed SpaceX CRS-1 and is expected to arrive at the orbiting lab on Wednesday morning (Oct. 7).      NASA space station program manager Mike Suffredini said Dragon's ability to launch supplies to the station and return cargo back to Earth is a cornerstone of boosting scientific research on the orbiting laboratory, as well as its day-to-day maintenance.      \\"Not to be overdramatic, but it's critical to the International Space Station,\\" Suffredini said during the countdown to launch. [Photos: Dragon Launches on 1st Space Station Cargo Trip]      Sunday night's launch was nearly flawless. One of the Falcon 9 rocket nine engines apparently shut down unexpectedly during the ascent, but the booster's eight other engines compensated for the glitch and delivered the Dragon spacecraft into its intended orbit, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said after the flight. The rocket is designed to do exactly that in the event of an engine anomaly, she added.      An American spaceship rises      When NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, it marked the first time in 30 years that the United States did not have an American spacecraft capable of flying missions to and from low-Earth orbit. NASA is relying on the availability of new private space taxis to deliver U.S. supplies, and ultimately astronauts, to the International Space Station.      Currently, the U.S. space agency depends on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to ferry crews to the station, and sends cargo on various robotic spacecraft operated by space agencies in Russia, Japan and Europe. But those unmanned space freighters are not designed to return science experiments and other station gear back to Earth. Instead, the spacecraft are disposed of in Earth's atmosphere by burning up during re-entry.      That is where Dragon stands out.      The gumdrop-shaped spacecraft is designed not only to haul cargo to the International Space Station but also to return hardware and experiments back to Earth. Under its terms with NASA, SpaceX has pledged to launch at least 20 metric tons of supplies to the space station during its 12-flight deal.      Dragon in flight      In May, the Hawthorne, Calif.–based SpaceX launched a test flight to the station using a different Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule to prove that it was ready to begin making bona fide supply runs. The demonstration was a success, paving the way for Sunday night's launch.      \\"Every time we fly, we learn something,\\" Shotwell said before launch. \\"We're a launch company; I'm excited every time we get to launch.\\"      For the first operational Dragon cargo mission to the station, SpaceX and NASA packed the capsule with more than 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) of supplies, food and other vital gear for the station's current three-person Expedition 33 crew. Those supplies include a special delivery of ice cream for the astronauts, a late addition packed as a special treat.      The Dragon capsule will pull up to the station on Wednesday and be grappled by astronauts using the outpost's robotic arm so it can be attached to an available docking port. After nearly three weeks at the space station, Dragon will undock for a planned Oct. 28 splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California, where it will be retrieved by a SpaceX recovery crew. [6 Fun Facts About SpaceX's Dragon Spacecraft]      The space station's three-person crew watched SpaceX's smooth Dragon launch live via a video feed beamed up by flight controllers. At the time of launch, the station was sailing 225 miles above Tasmania, NASA officials said.      \\"We are ready to grab Dragon!\\" the station's commander, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, radioed down to Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston along with congratulations for the SpaceX team.      NASA also confirmed today that a piece of space junk that will fly near the station Monday won't interfere with the crew's work preparing for Dragon's arrival, agency officials said.      The Dragon capsule is expected to return more than 2,000 pounds (907 kg) of science experiment results and station hardware so they can be studied or — in the case of the hardware — upgraded or repaired, station managers said.      SpaceX's Dragon capsules are 14.4 feet tall (4.4 meters) and about 12 feet wide (3.6 m). They rely on two solar panels for power, making them the first American solar-powered spacecraft to visit the International Space Station.      SpaceX has also received NASA funding to develop a manned version of Dragon as part of the agency's private space taxi efforts. Building a vehicle capable of carrying astronauts into space has long been a goal of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the company in 2002.      Shotwell said SpaceX expects to be ready to fly astronauts on Dragon spacecraft by 2015.      SpaceX is one of two companies with a NASA contract to provide unmanned cargo delivery flights to the space station. The other firm is the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp., which has a 1.9 billion deal for at least eight resupply flights to the station using its new Antares rocket and Cygnus spacecraft. Unlike Dragon, Orbital's Cygnus is not designed to return supplies to Earth.      The first Antares rocket test flight is expected later this year from a launch site in Virginia.

Ice cream is blasting off for the crew of the International Space Station (ISS).      The frozen confectionery — not the freeze-dried souvenir version sold in museum gift shops — is packed on board the first NASA-contracted commercial mission to resupply the orbiting laboratory.      The Commercial Resupply Services-1 (CRS-1) mission is scheduled to lift off on a Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Falcon 9 rocket on Sunday (Oct. 7) at 8:35 p.m. EDT (0035 GMT Oct. 8) from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.      The ice cream, which is now a not-so-secret surprise for the station's current three member crew, was confirmed as on board SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule by NASA after a pre-launch press conference Saturday (Oct. 6) raised the possibility that it was included.      \\"We talked about flying ice cream,\\" said NASA's manager for the space station program, Michael Suffredini. \\"We try to bring up what we call 'bonus food' for the crew, and this is one of those flights that will have that.\\" [Space Food Photos: What Astronauts Eat in Orbit]      GLACIER goodies      The vanilla with swirled chocolate sauce ice cream cups won't melt on their three-day journey to the space station thanks to a freezer on board the Dragon capsule.      \\"We're very excited,\\" SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told reporters. \\"This is the first time we are taking powered cargo up. We are taking up a GLACIER freezer, which has refrigerated science samples in it.\\"      The GLACIER, or General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator, is primarily used to preserve science samples that require temperatures between minus 301 and 39 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 and 4 degrees Celsius) on the way to or from the space station. The mini-fridge sized freezer previously flew aboard the space shuttle.      \\"Having been on a flight that had an empty freezer on it going up into space, we did fill it [with ice cream] and it's really nice!\\" Robert Cabana, former shuttle astronaut and the director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, said.      The CRS-1 flight is launching with more than 800 pounds (360 kilograms) of supplies, experiments and equipment to support the space station's crew, and will return to Earth with nearly 1,700 pounds (770 kg) of science results and spent hardware. SpaceX's Dragon capsule is designed to splashdown in the ocean and be recovered.      The mission is the first of a dozen supply flights for which NASA is paying SpaceX 1.6 billion to fly. This launch follows a demonstration flight in May that made history as the first commercial spacecraft to berth with the station.

What is the correct answer to the question from the following choices? OPT: (I). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases. (II). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases. (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. (IV). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases.","output":"The correct answer to the question is: (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases.  To understand why this statement is correct, we first need to discuss the basic properties of stars and the concept of apparent brightness. Stars emit light due to the nuclear reactions happening in their cores. The amount of light that a star emits is referred to as its luminosity. Apparent brightness, on the other hand, is the amount of light we observe from a star as seen from Earth. It is important to note that apparent brightness is affected not only by the star's intrinsic luminosity but also by its distance from Earth. Now, let's examine each statement provided in the question: (I). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its size increases. This statement is incorrect because the size of a star is an inherent property that does not change with distance. The distance from Earth only affects the star's apparent size in the sky, not its actual size. (II). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its size decreases. Similar to the first statement, this one is also incorrect for the same reasons. The actual size of a star remains constant, and increasing or decreasing the distance from Earth does not change its size. (III). As the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. This statement is correct. When the distance between a star and Earth decreases, the star appears brighter because the light it emits has less space to spread out before reaching us. This is explained by the inverse square law of light, which states that the intensity of light is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. (IV). As the distance from Earth to the star increases, its apparent brightness increases. This statement is incorrect because it contradicts the inverse square law of light. As the distance from the star to Earth increases, the apparent brightness of the star decreases, not increases, because the light has more space to spread out before reaching us. So, the correct answer to the question is statement (III), which states that as the distance from Earth to the star decreases, its apparent brightness increases. This relationship between distance and apparent brightness is fundamental to our understanding of how we observe and measure the properties of stars in the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Now, I have a new situation: Ben and Jerry were two friends with very different dietary habits. Jerry ate healthy food, and was always on top of his caloric consumption, while Ben overate because he loved fatty foods such as butter, bacon et al.  Answer this question please: Which friend was at a lower risk for health problems? Answer:","output":"Jerry was at a lower risk for health problems due to his healthy eating habits and being mindful of his caloric consumption. His diet likely consists of essential lipids in appropriate quantities, reducing the likelihood of unhealthy weight gain and high lipid levels in his bloodstream.

Elizabeth Masterson, a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott, a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a fateful happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth begin to bond, as much as that is possible, and he takes her out of town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has been there before, and in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 23-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves.

Movie title: The Black Stallion Movie plot: In 1946 young Alec Ramsey and his father are traveling back to England on the steamship Drake passing the north coast of Africa. While out on deck, Alec sees a handsome black Arabian stallion being forced into its pen above decks by some cruel men, using a bullwhip to get the frightened animal into its quarters. Returning to his father's card game, Alec takes some sugar cubes from the coffee tray & brings them to the stall where the horse is tied up. Placing them on the railing of the door, Alec then hides from sight. Within minutes the animal has taken the cubes. As Alec turns around he is grabbed & roughly accosted by the mean-looking owner of the horse, who shouts menacingly in a foreign language before letting him go. Alec quickly returns to his cabin.That night, Alec's father shows him his winnings from the card game. Alec receives a pocketknife and a small carving of a horse. His father tells him the horse is Bucephalus, the horse of Alexander the Great. Alec puts the Bucephalus carving on a shelf and falls asleep.Later that night, the carving is illuminated with a bright orange light. The ship pitches violently and Alec is thrown from his bunk onto the cabin floor. Grabbing the carving & his pocketknife, Alec gets to his feet and his dad throws a lifejacket over him. As the two of them stagger out into the hall they discover frightened passengers fleeing their rooms. Alec's dad sees water pouring in through a door, and they make their way onto the deck. As Alec looks up he sees the superstructure of the ship blazing with fire. His dad leaves him below with instructions to hang on to a rail, and goes to the boat deck. As Alec stays put he hears the horse in its pen, and decides to set the animal free and give him his chance to fight for life.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" is \\"physical weathering\\", given that  most canyons are formed by flowing water? A:","output":"While \\"physical weathering\\" partially contributes to the formation of canyons, it may not be the most accurate answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" given that most canyons are indeed formed by flowing water, specifically through the continuous and long-term action of erosion. Erosion refers to the process where the natural elements wear away at the earth's surface, and it mainly involves water, wind, and ice. In the case of canyons, water is the leading agent. To provide more context, let's explore the intricate process of canyon formation, which typically involves a combination of erosion, weathering, and other geological processes. 1. Erosion by flowing water: As water flows through a river or a stream, it carries sediments and rock particles with it. Over time, this moving water erodes the landscape, cutting deeper into the earth's surface. The erosional force exerted by the water becomes stronger as the volume and speed of the water increase, which is why canyons are commonly found in arid regions with occasional flash floods that rapidly concentrate large volumes of water within narrow channels. 2. Physical weathering: While the primary force behind canyon formation is erosion, physical weathering plays a supporting role. Physical weathering, also known as mechanical weathering, involves the breakdown of rocks and minerals through processes such as freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion and contraction, and abrasion. These processes can weaken the rock formations, making it easier for the erosional force of water to remove and transport sediments. 3. Chemical weathering: In addition to physical weathering, chemical weathering also contributes to canyon formation. Chemical weathering occurs when the minerals within rocks react with water, air, and other chemicals, leading to the alteration or dissolution of the rock. This process further weakens the rock formations, facilitating their removal by flowing water. 4. Tectonic activity: In some cases, geological processes such as the movement of tectonic plates can contribute to canyon formation. Uplift of the earth's crust can create steep river gradients, encouraging rapid stream erosion. In other cases, faulting can lead to stream capture and the formation of deep, narrow canyons along fault lines. 5. Differential erosion: Canyons typically develop in areas where the rock layers have varying degrees of resistance to erosion. Water will erode softer, less resistant rocks more quickly than harder, more resistant rocks. This results in a continuous deepening and widening process that ultimately leads to the formation of a canyon. In conclusion, although physical weathering does play a part in the formation of canyons, it is not the main cause. The most accurate answer to the question \\"what are most canyons caused by?\\" would be the action of flowing water via erosion. This dominant process, along with other contributing factors such as physical and chemical weathering as well as tectonic activity, work together to create the breathtaking canyons that we witness in various parts of the world today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.  Question: \\"Who built towns, industries, roads, bridges, and developed agriculture to influence all of Iberia?\\" Response: \\"Moors\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Luxury golf resorts are springing up in all corners of Hainan as the local government steps up its campaign to transform the island into the Hawaii of the east. The biggest project is Mission Hills Hainan, a vast undertaking that when finished will have at least 10 courses and cover an area nearly one and a half times the size of Manhattan. Environmentalists are alarmed by the potentially damaging effects of golf course construction on an island featuring rainforests, mountains, volcanoes and more than 300 endangered species. \\"Where does this begin and where does it end?\\" said Jonathan Smith, chief executive of the Golf Environment Organization, a non-governmental organization aimed at promoting sustainable golf. \\"What level of economic development can Hainan sustain while still having functioning ecosystems? You have to set a threshold on the level of development that can hit a region otherwise you will simply destroy its natural and cultural aspects,\\" Smith told CNN. Golf development in Hainan has gone into overdrive since January, when the state announced plans to make the island an international tourist destination by 2020, sparking a full-scale property boom. Clearwater Bay Golf Club is planning to compliment its three courses with a six or seven star hotel, while Yalong Bay Golf Club has bought the land to open a second course. But those developments are dwarfed by the scale of Mission Hills, where there are three courses, a 525-room hotel, 11 restaurants and plans for three conference rooms, three shopping malls and a spa. In October, Hollywood actors including Hugh Grant and Matthew McConaughey will join multiple major winners Greg Norman and Nick Faldo for the Mission Hills Star Trophy, with the winner set to scoop 1.28 million. The sheer scale of development has also raised eyebrows at international environmental activists Greenpeace. \\"Because Hainan is known for its vast and dense rainforest, it is very important to China and to the world,\\" Yi Lan, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace China, told CNN. \\"Any large-scale construction of golf courses would damage the local ecosystem. \\"We are very concerned about the rapid development of golf courses in Hainan and we think the local government should take strong measures to ensure the golf projects do not damage the local ecosystems.\\" Dan Washburn, a China-based journalist who has visited the Mission Hills complex in Hainan, says although the development mostly occupies an area designated as wasteland, fruit trees have been uprooted and local residents displaced from their homes. He told CNN: \\"I met with the head of a local environmental group who thought he had secured rights to open up a forest park on part of the land. They had worked for years to get approvals from the government and local village groups. \\"Then, all of a sudden, they were told their plans had been shelved. They soon found out the reason why. It was because of the Mission Hills project.\\" Mission Hills, which also owns a massive 12-course golf complex in Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland, say their Hainan project has created thousands of jobs and was subject to stringent environmental impact assessments. \\"Mission Hills has always strived to balance economic benefits to the community with proper stewardship of the environment,\\" Dr Ken Chu, Group Executive Vice Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer of the Mission Hills Group, told CNN by email. \\"By incorporating low-density development with vast open-space greenbelts, our current project in Haikou has transformed a barren, lava-rock landscape into an economically productive community.\\" Their claims are backed up by the local government, with spokesman Mr. Zhao telling CNN that the location of the complex followed \\"careful\\" investigation. \\"Therefore, the project will not pollute the environment,\\" he said. But those statements are not enough to pacify environmental groups, with Greenpeace vowing to investigate the case. \\"You have to say that the Mission Hills developments have been high-impact in environmental terms,\\" says Smith. \\"You can't deny that when there's the level of earth-shifting and movement of land form that there has been in the previous development. It's large-scale and each development couldn't really be defined as light touch. \\"Then you have the longer-term concerns over where does the water come from, where does the energy come from? Is it all fossil fuels? How much energy is required to desalinate or treat the sewage water?\\" Shane Templeton, a golf course consultant on Hainan for six years, says the sport can bring huge benefits to the island's economy if it is kept in balance with the local infrastructure. \\"Golf is great for Hainan and it's a vehicle for bringing a lot of foreign exchange, but it's got to be done carefully and within reason,\\" he told CNN. \\"I don't know who is regulating these people. You don't want 50 golf courses but no buses and no sewage systems -- it's got to grow together with everything.\\" Smith wants to see an end to the clandestine culture surrounding golf course construction in China. \\"What we would like to see is more transparency,\\" he said. \\"We would like to see the government's plans for the levels of development in Hainan clearly depicted so that people can understand the levels and type of development that are likely to take place in such regions.\\" \\"There comes a point, particularly on an island setting, where too much development puts too much pressure on the natural resources, and the cultural heritage and the landscape of that particular region.\\"","output":"China's push to turn Hainan, its only tropical island, into a golfing paradise is creating controversy among environmental groups. Luxury golf resorts, like Mission Hills Hainan, are being developed rapidly in an attempt to transform the island into the \\"Hawaii of the East\\". The scale of construction has raised concerns among environmentalists about the potential damage to the region's rainforests, mountains, volcanoes, and over 300 endangered species. Hainan features rich, dense rainforests, making it a significant part of China and the world's ecosystem. The rapid expansion of golf courses on the island has Greenpeace urging the local government to implement strong measures ensuring these developments do not cause harm to the local ecosystems. While some believe that golf tourism can contribute positively to Hainan's economy, it should be done in balance with the methods for preserving local infrastructure and the environment.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hi there little buddy! I see you have two interesting questions. Let me explain each one in a simple way. Question 1: To get medium-sized muscles, we need to eat healthy food and exercise. A good diet includes eating a balance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins like chicken and fish, and some healthy fats. Also, doing exercises like jumping, running, and playing games that use our muscles can help. But remember, the diet and muscle size will depend on each person's body and activity level. Question 2: The African cheetah's natural habitat is facing some problems. People are building more houses and roads, which takes away the space where cheetahs used to live and hunt. They also sometimes struggle to find food because their prey is declining. It's important for us to find ways to protect the cheetah's home and help them live a happy life in the wild.

Roger Federer (German pronunciation: ['rodZ@r 'fe:d@r@r]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 2 in men's singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He is regarded by many fans, players and analysts as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles--the most in history for a male player--and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 308 weeks, including 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.  Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92-5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.  In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis, and at the US Open, Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion). In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.  Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1. Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what would be Federer's only defeat before reaching the final of a tournament that year. Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.  A personal highlight for Federer came near the end of the season when he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runners up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Would rad B more likely or less likely make atmosphere warmer than rad A?  Mark was studying the effect of Sun's radiations on Earth. To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat.  Hint: Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. Answer:","output":"Rad B would be less likely to make the atmosphere warmer than rad A. This is because rad A represents the Sun's radiations (solar radiation), which has shorter wavelengths and contains more energy compared to rad B, which represents Earth's radiations emitted back into space at longer wavelengths. The shorter wavelengths of rad A are more effective at producing heat, while the energy in longer wavelengths of rad B is weaker. Additionally, part of the incoming solar radiation (rad A) is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to its warming, while some of the emitted Earth radiation (rad B) gets reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere and does not contribute as much to the atmospheric warming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

They join the countless species that have gone extinct   over the course of Earth's history - and extinction means forever. At least it used to. Scientists are now closing in on the ability to bring back extinct species. No, this doesn't mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality. Researchers need DNA to bring back a species. DNA is the chemical that carries the structure for a living thing. Dinosaurs have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. But there's a very real chance that we will be able to bring back more recently extinct species. This could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2003, a team of Spanish and French scientists re-created the Pyrenean ibex, which had gone extinct three years earlier. The new animal didn't survive long, but scientific advances should improve the success rate. In January, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing back the gastric brooding frog. That we can bring species back doesn't mean that we should. There may be benefits to reviving a species. But there's no way to know how it will turn out. For example, would a passenger pigeon fit into its old habitat? Or might it crowd out existing species? Environmentalists worry that our ability to bring species back might cut down support for the hard work of traditional conservation. Why worry about preserving a wildlife habitat or fighting poachers if we know we can just make up for our mistakes? But those extinctions are our mistakes to correct, which may give us an obligation   to do so. As businessman and environmentalist Stewart Brand recently said, \\"Humans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.\\" We would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution. Options: A That scientists cannot make up for the mistakes that they made in the past. B That traditional conservation might be of no use by bringing species back. C That scientists could lack the ability to bring back extinct species to life. D That species that will be brought back to life will not survive long.

Answer:","output":"The character Barney, if referring to the children's television show \\"Barney & Friends,\\" was primarily portrayed by a purple anthropomorphic Tyrannosaurus rex who was brought to life by several actors and costume performers throughout the show's run from 1992 to 2009. The primary costume performers who played Barney were David Joyner and Carey Stinson, whereas the voice actors for Barney included Bob West, Duncan Brannan, and Dean Wendt. David Joyner was the first performer to don the Barney costume from the show's inception in 1992 until 2001. His role involved physically portraying Barney, meaning he was responsible for the character's actions, movements, and expressions. To bring the character to life, David Joyner wore a heavy, full-body costume that could weigh up to 70 pounds. His dedication to accurately representing Barney's physical presence contributed largely to the character's success on television. Carey Stinson was another important performer who took the role of Barney. Stinson became the primary costume performer for Barney from 2002 until the show ended in 2009. Like Joyner, Stinson's role involved physically embodying Barney, bringing energy, joy, and enthusiasm to the character's interactions with children and other characters on the show. Bob West was the primary voice of Barney from the show's beginning in 1992 until 2000. West provided the character's signature deep, gentle, and friendly voice that endeared Barney to its young audience. West helped develop the personality and expressiveness of Barney's speaking voice, including the character's costume performer David Joyner's directions on set. Following West's departure, Duncan Brannan took over the role of voicing Barney from 2000 to 2001. Brannan continued to uphold the character's warm, reassuring, and energetic vocal style that had been established by West. In 2002, Dean Wendt became the official voice of Barney and continued in that role until the end of the series in 2009. Wendt carried on the tradition of Barney's distinct voice and personality, ensuring the character remained consistent and appealing to the show's young fans. In conclusion, the portrayal of Barney was a collaborative effort between various talented costume performers and voice actors. The most significant performers were David Joyner and Carey Stinson, who physically embodied the character, and the primary voice actors, Bob West, Duncan Brannan, and Dean Wendt, who were responsible for giving Barney his recognizable and endearing speaking voice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question:   Compared to the curved lenses of a pair of binoculars, would a large flat sheet of glass refract less light? or more light? The answer is:","output":"A large flat sheet of glass would refract less light compared to the curved lenses of a pair of binoculars. This is because, as mentioned in the paragraph, the more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts light. Binocular lenses have curved surfaces designed to focus and magnify incoming light, which causes more refraction. In contrast, a flat sheet of glass has minimal curvatures, resulting in less refraction and alteration of the light passing through it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fiona Dickie: The beauty queen now struggles to wear stilettos as a result of the crash. A beauty queen received £18,000 in damages yesterday after a car crash left her unable to wear high heels comfortably. Fiona Dickie, 24, was hit by a Suzuki 4x4 while driving, leaving her with back injuries that make slipping into stilettos a painful experience. Incredibly, despite her injuries, the 24-year-old went on to win the Miss Edinburgh competition in 2010 following the collision in April the previous year, but her ability to take part in charity events has been limited because of continuing back pain. She raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh suing the other driver Mohammadreza Khandani, also of Edinburgh, for damages following the collision. Khandani admitted liability but he wanted to pay around £3,500 but Miss Dickie wanted closer to £20,000. The court heard that the accident occurred on April 10 in 2009 shortly after midnight in Edinburgh’s South Clerk Street as Miss Dickie returned home from working at a drinks promotion event. She was left shocked and distressed and suffered bruising to her chest and pain in her neck and back. The sales manager went home after the accident but later phoned NHS Direct because she was in pain. A nurse said she should consult her GP and she was subsequently referred for physiotherapy, where Miss Dickie was later diagnosed with chronic low back pain. After deciding on the £18,000 compensation today, which included £10,000 for 'pain and suffering' judge Gordon Reid QC  said: 'The pursuer (Miss Dickie) is an attractive young woman and also carried out some work as a model, usually at charitable events. 'She did not wish however to have a career as a model. 'She was expected to wear high heels for this promotional work. Doing so aggravated her back.' Mr Reid said that after she won the Miss Edinburgh contest her main duty was attend and take part in charity events. 'Her ability to participate in the usual range of such events was limited because of her continuing back pain,' he said. Payout: The Edinburgh Court of Sessions, pictured, heard today that she would be getting £18,000 - £10,000 of which was for pain and suffering. 'The pursuer felt she was letting people down by not participating in as many events as, but for her back pain, she would other wise have done. She gave as an example various fun runs in which she was not able to participate. 'In spite of her attractive looks and the promotional work which she carried out the pursuer was very much against women being employed on the basis of their looks. 'She strongly opposed the WAG (wives and girlfriends) culture and part of her purpose in wishing to become Miss Edinburgh was to encourage young girls to be independent, to be their own boss and not to rely on men,' he said. 'She has adopted a sensible attitude to her continuing back problems. Sje knows she can wear high heels but will suffer the next day for doing so. It seems to me that rather than being criticised she should be commended for her efforts. 'In the present case it is abundantly plain on the evidence that since the accident she has complained of and suffered intermittent lower back pain. She did not suffer such pain before the accident. 'She is not exaggerating her injuries to enhance the value of her claim. If she is, it is a strange way of going about it. She returned to work, resumed part-time employment over and above her day job and continued her modelling and charity work,' he said. The judge awarded her a total of pounds 18,281, including pounds 10,000 for her pain and suffering. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Beauty queen Fiona Dickie was awarded £18,000 in damages after a car accident left her with back injuries that made it difficult for her to wear high heels comfortably.

Holly Gent Palmo and Vincent Palmo Jr. adapted the film's screenplay from Robert Kaplow's novel of the same name about a teenager (in reality, the 15-year-old Arthur Anderson, who played Lucius in Welles' production) involved in the founding of Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. After receiving funding from CinemaNX, a production company backed by the Isle of Man film fund, and an offer from Framestore Features to co-finance the film, Richard Linklater came on board to direct Me and Orson Welles. Zac Efron signed on as the lead in early January 2008, claiming he decided to take the role of Richard Samuels because \\"It's a completely different project than I've ever done before,\\" while Claire Danes joined the cast as the protagonist's love interest Sonja Jones in late January.  In the theatre, Christian McKay had portrayed Orson Welles in the one-man play Rosebud: The Lives of Orson Welles at a number of venues, including the Edinburgh Festival and King's Head (London). He reprised the role in the U.S. at the 2007 \\"Brits Off Broadway\\" festival, where Linklater saw his performance and then cast McKay as Welles, retaining him over the subsequent objections of the project's producer.  Me and Orson Welles underwent filming in the Isle of Man, Pinewood Studios, London and New York from February to April 2008. Filming in London commenced first in mid-February, before scenes in the Isle of Man were shot February 24-March 14, 2008, where filming locations included Gaiety Theatre and various other parts of Douglas. During filming in Douglas, Efron and Danes believe they sighted a ghost, or \\"supernatural\\" being, outside a window on set at Gaiety Theatre.  Filming in Britain resumed in late March for six weeks at Pinewood Studios. Other locations included Crystal Palace Park, where a facade of New York's Mercury Theatre was set up for a scene. Actor James Tupper claimed that the best replica of an old New York theater was in England, while many of the actors who filled the company were from the Royal Shakespeare Company. The production crew only briefly visited New York; photographs were taken and footage shot to be added into the film as digital effects. Every exterior shot was filmed on a single street built at Pinewood Studios with a green screen at one end; different angles and slightly altered set designs were used between shots to make the street appear different each time.

Information:  - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton.  - Buckland including Buckland Valley is a village near ( and now merged with ) Dover , England . It is noted for its Saxon cemetery whose finds now belong to the British Museum but are on display at Dover Museum . English railway contractor , Edward Betts , was born in Buckland .  - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\"  - The British Museum is dedicated to human history, art and culture, and is located in the Bloomsbury area of London.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Cambridge native Jimmy Tingle has been a fixture on Boston’s comedy scene since the 1980s. Twenty years ago, Jimmy Tingle shifted his career into DIY mode when he rented out the Hasty Pudding Theatre for an extended run of his comic one-man show. He has followed that path ever since, taking on the financial risk and responsibility of running the house — almost exclusively in New England — including a five-year stint as proprietor of Jimmy Tingle’s Off-Broadway Theater in Davis Square, Somerville. When he plays New Year’s Eve at the Wilbur, that’s going to change. It’s unusual, Tingle notes in a telephone interview, for a comedian to rent a space to put on his or her own show. That business is usually handled by bookers or producers. Tingle took the initiative so he could develop the show he wanted to see and for a bigger stage. “By doing it yourself and being your own producer, it just gave you the freedom to do things,” he says. “If I had to wait for a producer for that to happen, I probably never would have gotten into that theater.” Tingle, 60, is still working social media and promoting the show. But for the most part he’s just the talent for the Wilbur gig. He mainly has to worry about being funny. “It’s great to be working at the Wilbur because they just do so much and that’s all they do, they’re a producing house,” he says. “Hopefully it’ll lead to other places where you just go in and do your thing, you don’t have to worry about everything else.” It would be hard to imagine Boston comedy without Tingle. The Cambridge native has been a fixture since the much ballyhooed comedy boom of the ’80s. And he has stuck close to home in large part for domestic reasons. “I never really wanted to be on the road while we’re starting a family,” says Tingle. “I didn’t want my wife to be a single parent. And this is such a great area for what I do. There’s millions of people in this Greater Boston area. And it’s just been a great place to perform, work. The sensibilities of the people that live here, we have very similar sensibilities. So it was easy and it was comfortable, and it is comfortable to stay.” Tingle and his wife, Catherine, celebrated their 20th anniversary in November, and just sent their son, Seamus, to college. He and his wife are empty nesters, Tingle notes, which gives him more freedom to expand his range in 2016. “I hope to be traveling more,” he says. To that end, Tingle has been getting advice from former Boston producer Barry Katz, who worked with a slew of well-known comedians, including Dane Cook, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K., early in their careers. Tingle was scheduled to head to Los Angeles the day after he spoke with the Globe to be a guest on Katz’s podcast, “Industry Standard,” and Jay Mohr’s “Mohr Stories.” Tingle did a handful of podcasts under his “Humor for Humanity” banner this year, some of which have not yet aired. He’ll bring that back in 2016. “I’m interested in utilizing the technology that’s available to do my own thing,” says Tingle, “and trying to go to another level of commitment in terms of that.” Podcasting takes some getting used to for a comedian conditioned to pull laughter from a live audience. The Humor for Humanity mission statement is “more than entertainment — raising spirits, funds, and awareness for nonprofits, charities, and social causes.” That goes for the podcast as well as the live shows (part of the proceeds for the Wilbur show will go to Globe Santa). That can be a hard balance to strike on a podcast when you’re talking about serious subjects with guests from food pantries or the Red Cross. “I forget, oh yeah, it’s ‘Humor for Humanity,’ ” he says. “That’s kind of the needle I’m trying to thread there. How to be consistent with the entertainment part as well as the content part.” Tingle won’t be ignoring his local roots. A lot of his work live and with the podcast will benefit New England-based organizations. But he does want the podcast to have more of a national appeal eventually. He compares developing a podcast to paying dues as a local comic. “You don’t develop, really, onstage in LA or New York,” he says. “You develop someplace regionally where you can experiment and practice and get your sea legs. Then you go to New York or LA.” JIMMY TINGLE!

Please answer this question: the three core concepts of expectancy violations theory are?","output":"To answer this question, I will first explain what Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) is, then outline the three core concepts of the theory. Step 1: Explain Expectancy Violations Theory Expectancy Violations Theory, developed by Judee K. Burgoon, is a communication theory that seeks to explain how individuals respond to unexpected behaviors from others in social interactions. EVT posits that we have expectations about how others should behave based on social norms, context, and personal experiences. When these expectations are violated, it can lead to positive or negative evaluations and reactions. Step 2: Identify and explain the three core concepts of EVT 1. Expectancy: Expectancy refers to our beliefs about how others will behave in a given situation. These beliefs are based on factors such as social norms, personal relationships, and communication context. When someone's behavior aligns with our expectations, we tend to feel comfortable and at ease. However, when someone's behavior deviates from our expectations, we may feel surprised, confused, or even upset. 2. Violation Valence: Violation valence refers to the positive or negative evaluation an individual assigns to an expectancy violation. This evaluation is subjective and may depend on various factors, such as the relationship between the individuals involved, the nature of the unexpected behavior, and the specific context in which the interaction occurs. In some cases, a violation may be perceived as a positive development - for instance, if a reserved person becomes unexpectedly outgoing in a social setting. On the other hand, a violation might be seen as negative if someone is inappropriately intrusive in a private matter. 3. Communicator Reward Valence: Communicator reward valence refers to the positive or negative attributes that an individual associates with the person committing the expectancy violation. This evaluation affects how the expectancy violation is perceived and may influence the individual's response to the violation. For example, if an individual perceives the violator as a high-reward person - someone with high social status, attractiveness, or a close relationship - they may be more likely to excuse the unexpected behavior or even see it as positive. Conversely, if the violator is perceived as low in reward value, the expectancy violation may result in unfavorable judgments or negative reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Spread over three tournaments, what began in bright sunlight on the ancient links at Hoylake at The Open in July ended on Sunday in darkness on the modern stadium course at Valhalla in Louisville. Rory McIlroy went into those trio of events with doubts about his ability to play the most venerable form of the game; with freaky Fridays swirling his conscience.

The question doesn't mention any reason for the animals to feel pain or discomfort. Hence, \\"feel pain\\" is not the correct answer. 2. The ability to fly is not related to the animals being by the river or their thirst, so \\"fly\\" is not the correct answer. 3. \\"Pass water\\" refers to the animals crossing the river or possibly urinating. This can be considered as the animals interact with the river in some way, even though they are not thirsty. It seems to be the most logical answer among the given choices for the animals' activity by the river. 4. \\"Die of cancer\\" is unrelated to the animals being by the river and their thirst, so effectively it's not the correct answer. 5.

Question: How did education impact the country? Context: The highest position in Islam, caliphate, was claimed by the sultans starting since Murad I, which was established as Ottoman Caliphate. The Ottoman sultan, pâdişâh or \\"lord of kings\\", served as the Empire's sole regent and was considered to be the embodiment of its government, though he did not always exercise complete control. The Imperial Harem was one of the most important powers of the Ottoman court. It was ruled by the Valide Sultan. On occasion, the Valide Sultan would become involved in state politics. For a time, the women of the Harem effectively controlled the state in what was termed the \\"Sultanate of Women\\". New sultans were always chosen from the sons of the previous sultan. The strong educational system of the palace school was geared towards eliminating the unfit potential heirs, and establishing support among the ruling elite for a successor. The palace schools, which would also educate the future administrators of the state, were not a single track. First, the Madrasa (Ottoman Turkish: Medrese‎) was designated for the Muslims, and educated scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition. The financial burden of the Medrese was supported by vakifs, allowing children of poor families to move to higher social levels and income. The second track was a free boarding school for the Christians, the Enderûn, which recruited 3,000 students annually from Christian boys between eight and twenty years old from one in forty families among the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans, a process known as Devshirme (Devşirme). Answer:","output":"Education impacted the country by playing a crucial role in shaping the future leaders and administrators of the Ottoman Empire. The strong educational system of the palace school was designed to eliminate unfit potential heirs and establish support among the ruling elite for a successor. This system comprised two tracks: the Madrasa and the Enderûn.  The Madrasa educated Muslim scholars and state officials according to Islamic tradition, allowing children from poor families to rise to higher social levels and increase their income, as its financial burden was supported by vakifs. On the other hand, the Enderûn was a free boarding school for Christian boys, recruiting students annually from the communities settled in Rumelia or the Balkans. This process, known as Devshirme (Devşirme), enabled the Empire to assimilate and educate young Christian boys, shaping them into loyal, skilled administrators and helping to maintain the vast and multi-ethnic empire's stability. Overall, education was vital in equipping future leaders with the knowledge and skills necessary to govern and maintain the Ottoman Empire, while also providing social mobility for talented individuals from different social and religious backgrounds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first.

The author begins with a statement that they love to gamble and live close to the casino they are reviewing. This initially sets a positive context, as they seem to be in the target demographic for this business. 2. However, they then mention having visited casinos in Vegas and Macau more frequently than the Montreal casino over the last 10 years. This implies a preference for these other locations, indicating a less favorable view of the Montreal casino. 3. The reviewer directly states their dislike for the Montreal casino and compares its management style to that of their country's government, which they seem to also dislike. This comparison expresses a negative sentiment. 4. The mention of a dealer not being allowed to smile demonstrates dissatisfaction with the customer service experience and adds another negative element to the review. 5. The reviewer declares they won't be giving any of their money to the Montreal casino in the near future, which is a strong statement of disapproval. 6. Finally, the comparison of Vegas's flair and charm to Montreal's lack thereof emphasizes the overall negative impression of the Montreal casino. Based on the evaluation of the content and the predominantly negative tone, I would conclude that the review is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a text based on this summary: calcutta prisoners demand to see ipl telecasts Text:","output":"Title: Prisoners in Calcutta Petition for IPL Telecasts Within Penitentiary Walls In an unexpected move, a group of prisoners housed in the Calcutta penitentiary has sparked a conversation about rights and leisure for those behind bars. This group has launched a formal demand to be allowed to watch the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches live on television. This sudden appeal by some of Calcutta's incarcerated residents throws light on the commonly overlooked aspect of prisoners' rights to recreation and entertainment. Their demand for access to IPL telecasts, a premier sporting event religiously followed by millions of cricket enthusiasts, might sound audacious to many. However, it starts a conversation on the quality of life within prisons. The IPL, a highly popular annual cricket league played in India, has an extensive fan base ranging from ordinary citizens to individuals of high influence. The excitement and cheers that rounds of cricket generate give an inkling as to why the prisoners raised their voice for IPTV broadcast access within their otherwise restrained and monotone lives. Initially, this unique request bewildered the prison authorities. To them, the very idea that prisoners were seeking permission to enjoy a luxury like the IPL seemed unprecedented and far-fetched. However, prison officials are mandated to assess the implications of this demand in a broader perspective, considering the rules against televised privileges in prison system of Calcutta. The prisoners' argument lies in the belief that access to IPL matches will provide a respite from their monotonous routine and might even boost their morale. According to them, decent treatment must not only be towards developing skill sets and preparing them for a life after prison, but it should also involve opportunities for recreation and temporary relief from their constrained lives. Ensuing debates cropped up between prison reform campaigners and those against such prisoner-centric proposals. Advocates for reform stood firm on the notion that such activities could act as a reform measure, encouraging better behavior and thus keeping the prison environment more harmonious. On the other side, opponents argue that such luxuries present an unwarranted deviation from what should be a punitive environment. Should the authorities permit the broadcasting of IPL matches in the prisons, it would undoubtedly be a topic of national discussion. It would invariably set a precedent for future engagements involving penal institutions and the quality of life within them. The outcome of this landmark demand can potentially redefine the concept of punishment and rehabilitation in India, a country with a bulging prison population. Consequently, the fledgling movement by the prisoners in Calcutta isn't merely about watching cricket. It is about acknowledging the need for prison reform and addressing the living conditions of prisoners for better rehabilitation. The demand for IPL telecasts has unleashed a broader debate about human rights, decent treatment, and whether there’s a need for a paradigm shift in the way society views and treats prisoners. In simple terms, the prisoners' demand to watch IPL matches has brought about a change no one expected but might serve as the starting point for advocating higher quality treatment, not just for prisoners in Calcutta, but also for incarcerated individuals widespread across the nation. For the Indian criminal justice system, this unprecedented request may force a reassessment, propelling the administration and society closer to extensive prison reforms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nintendo Entertainment System: Encouraged by these successes, Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market. Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari’s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System. The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983. However, Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo's Donkey Kong game. This violation of Atari's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo's game console marketing contract with Atari. Atari's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month, so the deal went nowhere, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g[›] Please answer a question about this article.

How to get your dog to pee on command  Choose a trigger word or phrase to use.  When teaching a dog a command you need to come up with a verbal trigger. This should be a word or sound that indicates to the dog what you would like it to do.","output":"Step 1: Select a consistent location for your dog to pee. Choose an area in your yard or during walks where you want your dog to regularly eliminate. Consistency is crucial in building association and helps to create a predictable routine, thereby reinforcing the learning process for your dog. Step 2: Take your dog to the designated location. Whether in your yard or during walks, lead your dog to this area each time it needs to eliminate. Step 3: Say the trigger word or phrase as your dog begins to pee. This word should be unique and used exclusively for this purpose to avoid confusing your dog. Some examples could be \\"go potty\\" or \\"do your business.\\"  Step 4: Reward your dog immediately after it finishes peeing. Provide positive reinforcement, such as treats, praise, or affection, to encourage your dog to associate the action of peeing with the trigger word or phrase. Step 5: Be patient and consistent in your training. It may take several weeks for your dog to fully understand the connection between the trigger word and the action of peeing. Continue to use the same word or phrase and consistently reward your dog each time it successfully eliminates on command. Step 6: Gradually reduce the rewards. Once your dog consistently pees on command, begin to gradually decrease the frequency of rewards, moving from every time to every other time, and eventually only rewarding occasionally. This will help your dog maintain the learned behavior without becoming overly reliant on treats. By following these steps and remaining consistent in your efforts, you will be able to successfully teach your dog to pee on command, making it an invaluable skill, especially when traveling or in situations when a quick bathroom break is needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.","output":"After reading the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding\\" is not true. In fact, the paragraph suggests the opposite idea: gastrointestinal bleeding can occur as a consequence of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  NSAIDs exert their therapeutic effects by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). This enzyme is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are molecules that play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation, pain, and fever. However, there are two main isoforms of the COX enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. While COX-2 is predominantly involved in the production of prostaglandins during inflammation, COX-1 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins that help maintain the normal function of the gastrointestinal tract, including the protection of its mucosal lining. Aspirin and other NSAIDs can inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, which means that while they are effective in reducing inflammation and pain, they can also interfere with the protective functions of prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal tract. The inhibition of COX-1 results in reduced levels of prostaglandins, leading to decreased production of the protective mucus and bicarbonate layers in the stomach lining. This increases the risk of irritation and damage to the stomach lining by the acidic gastric contents, which may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, NSAIDs can also impair blood clotting, which can contribute to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin, in particular, has an irreversible effect on the inhibition of platelet aggregation, which is necessary for the formation of blood clots at the site of injury to prevent excessive blood loss. If a person taking aspirin experiences an injury to the gastrointestinal lining, their body may have a reduced ability to clot blood, increasing the risk of bleeding. In conclusion, the hypothesis stating that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding is false. On the contrary, aspirin usage can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to its action on COX-1 inhibition and its effect on blood clotting, as the given paragraph suggests."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press)      BERLIN (AP) — The Latest on a train crash in Germany that has caused deaths and injuries (all times local):      12:25 p.m.      German police say the death toll from a head-on train crash in the southern state of Bavaria has risen to nine.      Federal police spokesman Rainer Scharf told The Associated Press at the scene of the accident that the ninth body was still being removed from the train.      All survivors have now been taken to safety and investigators are beginning to look through the wreckage.      ___      12:10 p.m.      The city blood donation center in Munich has put out an urgent call for donors after a train crash near the city in southern Germany took at least eight lives and left 150 injured.      The Munich Blood Donation Service, which delivers blood products to local hospitals, said Tuesday on its website that there was \\"an acute increased need for life-saving blood products\\" after the accident near the town of Bad Aibling, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) to the southeast.      It asked donors to come \\"right now\\" to the donation center in the city's downtown. The donation service is part of the city's municipal clinic.      ___      12:05 p.m.      German police say all survivors of a morning train crash in Bavaria have now been rescued from the wreckage and taken to hospitals for treatment.      Federal police spokesman Rainer Scharf told The Associated Press from the scene that crews were still trying to remove one body from one of the two trains involved in the head-on collision.      Authorities say at least eight people were killed in the crash and 150 injured; the cause is not yet known.      Scharf says now that all the survivors have been taken to safety, authorities will begin trying to determine what went wrong.      ___      11:10 a.m.      German police say the death toll in the train crash in southern Germany has risen to eight.

Rescue helicopters are carrying people on a rope across the Mangfall river to ambulances waiting on the other side, four hours after the two trains crashed head-on.      German news agency reported that the rail line is used by commuters going to Munich for work. Usually schoolchildren also take the trains, but they are currently on winter vacation.      ___      10:45 a.m.      Federal police spokesman Stefan Brandl says the stretch of line on which the two trains crashed is squeezed between the Mangfall river on one side and a forest on the other, which is making rescue operations very difficult.      He confirmed that four people had died and some 100 were injured, several seriously, but cautioned that the numbers would change. \\"The current number of dead and injured is a shapshot; this can and will still change.\\"      Asked about the cause of the crash, Brandl responded, \\"We're still in the middle of the rescue operations, it's too early to talk about possible reasons for the crash now.\\"      Police called a news conference for noon (1100 GMT).      ___      10:20 a.m.      The operator of the two trains that crashed, Bayerische Oberlandbahn, says on its website that the trains of the so-called Meridian line both partially derailed and are wedged into each other.

Dpa reported that eight rescue helicopters were standing on a lawn near the entrance to the town of Bad Aibling and further rescue staff were on the way to the scene of the crash. ||||| At least nine people have died and scores have been injured – 50 seriously – after two commuter trains collided in southern Germany, police have said.      The crash happened near the Bavarian town of Bad Aibling at 6.48am on Tuesday. Several carriages overturned after the trains, which were travelling in opposite directions, collided head on.      The death toll had risen to 10 at one point, though police later revised it down to nine, with 50 severely injured and a further 100 carrying light injuries.      Federal police spokesman Stefan Brandl cautioned that the toll would change. He said: “The current number of dead and injured is a snapshot; this can and will change.”            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paramedics attend to a crash victim. Photograph: Michael Dalder/Reuters      The passengers were mostly commuters travelling between Munich and Rosenheim. Because of school holidays, many children who would normally take the trains were not on board, a local newspaper said.      Rescue workers from across Bavaria and from Austria attended the scene, with the injured transported by helicopter and boat from the site.      Both train drivers died in the crash. There is no information so far as to why the trains were on the single-lane track travelling in opposite directions at the same time.            “The accident is a huge shock for us. We’re doing everything to help the passengers, their relatives and train personnel,” Bernd Rosenbusch, the head of the Bavarian overland train service BOB, told the local news portal Mangfall24.      The trains’ operator, Meridian, is part of French passenger transport firm Transdev, which is jointly owned by state-owned bank CDC and water and waste firm Veolia.      State-owned Deutsche Bahn is responsible for the track. The line has a system that makes a train brake automatically if it goes through a red light.      The line between Holzkirchen and Rosenheim was closed indefinitely with a replacement bus service in operation. A press conference was expected to take place at midday. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"At least nine people have been killed and around 150 others injured, with more than 50 in a serious condition, after two local trains collided head-on in southern Germany.

Article: When I was about eight years old, I decided that I wanted to be a famous film star when I grew up. Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed. Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels   at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene. When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \\"snow\\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \\"snow\\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair! These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \\"everyday\\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. Question: Most modern studios  _  . Options: A: spend a lot money on computers B: use a lot of common sound in films C: use computers for everyday sounds D: give Foley artists a lot of new ideas Answer:","output":"C: use computers for everyday sounds"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both these parties are dominant forces in the nation's political landscape, while there are over 20 additional minor parties that also participate in the country's politics. The PRS is a significant political organization in Guinea-Bissau that has played a crucial role in shaping the government and policies since its establishment in 1992. It was founded by former President Kumba Yalá, who had served the country from 2000 to 2003. The Party for Social Renewal was formed in response to the country's long struggle for democracy, human rights, and social justice. It aimed to focus on nation-building and implementing policies to improve the quality of life for the people of Guinea-Bissau. Over the years, the PRS has been involved in coalition governments and has held significant positions within the political system. The party particularly appeals to the younger population and those who seek improvements in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and efficient governance. In summary, the other major political party in Guinea-Bissau, apart from the PAIGC, is the PRS or Party for Social Renewal. Both parties have been instrumental in shaping the course of the nation's politics and governance, with each commanding a considerable following and representing different sections of the society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Ashley Collman Two junior hockey league players were arrested this week on child pornography charges stemming from an illicit meeting with a 15-year-old girl in a Minnesota hotel room. On Monday, Lincoln Stars players Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith, both 19, were charged with use of a minor in a sexual performance as well as possession and dissemination of child pornography. A 15-year-old girl from Moorhead has accused the two men of videotaping her having sex, and then sending the video to several friends. Off the ice and into court: U.S. Hockey League players Thomas Ryan Carey (left) and Brandon Nicholas Smith (right), both 19, have been handed child pornography charges after allegedly filming a 15-year-old girl having sex in a motel room last February She suspected OPTIONS: - Ashley Collman took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Brandon Nicholas Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Carey took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Hockey League took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Lincoln Stars took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Minnesota took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Moorhead took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - Thomas Ryan Carey took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. - U.S. took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video.","output":"She suspected Brandon Nicholas Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video. The victim reportedly told authorities that she met Carey and Smith at a party in Moorhead, Minnesota. After engaging in a conversation with the two men, she agreed to accompany them to a nearby hotel room. Once inside the room, the victim claims that the sexual encounter took place, and she became aware that one of the players was recording it without her consent. After the incident, the 15-year-old girl discovered that the video had been shared with several people via text messages. Feeling hurt, violated, and upset, she decided to report the crime to the police. The Moorhead Police Department subsequently launched an investigation into the incident, leading to the arrest and charging of both players, Thomas Ryan Carey and Brandon Nicholas Smith. The Lincoln Stars hockey organization and the U.S. Hockey League have taken swift action regarding this case. Both Carey and Smith have been suspended indefinitely from the team, pending the outcome of their trial. The league and team are cooperating fully with the authorities, reiterating that they have zero-tolerance for such deplorable acts and have the welfare of the victim as their top priority. The shocking incident has triggered a heated debate over the conduct of young athletes, the responsibilities of sports organizations in preventing abuse, and the role of bystanders in perpetuating the harmful behavior. Parents, coaches, and communities are calling for strict measures, including stringent background checks, mandatory trainings on consent and appropriate behavior, and clear policies against any form of abuse. In the midst of this social debate, the overwhelming sympathy lies with the young victim who had her trust shattered and her dignity violated by those she thought she could trust. The case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers young people may face in seemingly innocent situations and the importance of educating them about consent, personal boundaries, and their rights. As the trial date approaches, the victim and her family are bracing for a difficult time in court. They are determined to seek justice and ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Carey and Smith, on the other hand, will handle the legal battle with their respective attorneys, and the outcome of the trial will determine the path their careers and lives will take. Regardless of the outcome, this case highlights the critical need for ongoing dialogue surrounding consent, respect, and the responsibility each individual holds in upholding the safety and dignity of others. The sports world, in particular, must come together to rectify the culture and prevent such abhorrent actions from ever happening again."},{"instruction":"Read the below conversation.

Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises. In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, Frieda Miller - then Director of United States Department of Labour - told the International Labour Organisation that these home-based operations offered, \\"low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions.\\" What is the answer to this question: What time were home manufactoring activities for children taking place?","output":"The article does not provide specific information regarding the exact time when home manufacturing activities for children took place. However, it mentions that families operated out of their homes seven days a week and year-round, which implies that children could be working alongside their parents throughout the day, and potentially during extended hours, depending on the demands of the work.

South Carolina schools were shut on Monday and several motorways were closed as rain continued to fall.      One weather station in Columbia - South Carolina's capital - recorded 17 inches (43cm) in as many hours on Sunday.      The torrential rains have been made worse by a weather system connected to Hurricane Joaquin in the Caribbean.      The storm is not expected to hit the eastern US, but the moisture associated with it is contributing to heavy rainfall.      \\"The flooding is unprecedented and historical,\\" said Dr Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia.      Many of the victims have drowned after flood waters swept over their vehicles.      South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley urged residents to stay indoors.      \\"The water is not safe and a lot of areas across the state where you see this deep water, it's got bacteria in it. So, stay inside and don't get in there,\\" she said.

About 100 people were rescued from their cars on flooded roads on Saturday night.      In the historic city centre of Charleston, many streets have been closed and sandbags have been piled up to keep floodwaters out. ||||| CLOSE As historic rain continues to pound South Carolina, people were forced to evacuate their homes. Boats helped rescue those who were stranded.      Floodwaters rise as a vehicle and a man navigate flooded streets in Florence, S.C., on Sunday. (Photo: Gerry Broome, AP)      Much of South Carolina was gripped by floodwaters early Monday, as emergency responders promised renewed door-to-door searches for anyone still trapped after days of torrential rain.      At least seven weather-related deaths have been blamed on the storm, as \\"historic\\" rainfall up to 2 feet in some areas combined with high winds to strand motorists and residents and force hundreds of evacuations and rescues.      As for the economic cost of the flooding, it should \\"easily surpass 1 billion given the enormity of the damage,\\" according to an early estimate from Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with Aon Benfield, a global reinsurance firm.      \\"The cost to infrastructure alone could be that much, \\" Bowen said in an e-mail to USA TODAY. \\"Unfortunately, as is the case with flood events, much of the damage will not be covered by insurance since only a small percentage of homeowners in South Carolina are current National Flood Insurance Program policyholders.\\"      The rain was forecast to continue deep into Monday in some parts of the state. Overnight curfews were in effect beginning at 6 p.m. Sunday in Columbia, Sumter and several counties.      Gov. Nikki Haley on Sunday said South Carolina's first responders were battling flooding from rains that can be expected once in 1,000 years.

Columbia recorded more than 10 inches.      President Obama approved federal disaster aid for South Carolina.      Haley said first responders received more than 750 rescue calls in a 12-hour period that started before dawn Sunday. Hundreds of road closures were reported, including a section of Interstate 95, the vital highway connecting eastern states from Maine to Florida.      CLOSE South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley says that parts of her state haven't had this much rain in 1,000 years. So far, three people have died from weather-related incidents in South Carolina. VPC      Haley said 600 National Guard personnel have been called out, with hundreds more on alert. And she warned residents not to plan on getting out until Tuesday to ease the burden on rescue personnel.      Among those rescued were a mother and her 15-month-old daughter, who were rescued from the roof of their flooded home by a Coast Guard air crew in Huger, about 25 miles north of Charleston, on Sunday. A helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Savannah, Ga., evacuated the pair to Mt. Pleasant Regional Airport.      AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski called the weather event the worst in the state since Hurricane Hugo, which made landfall near Charleston as a Category 4 storm in 1989, killing 27 people in the state.      \\"Charleston got 11.5 inches of rain on Saturday, which is a one-day record,\\" Pydynowski said. \\"Today Columbia is setting records.\\"      In Mount Pleasant, Sarah Shinners said her home was above the waterline — but the only road out of her neighborhood was impassable.      \\"Everything around us is completely flooded. It's terrible,\\" Shinners told USA TODAY. \\"We are just hunkering down.\\"      Much of the East Coast has been saturated by rains that have lingered since Thursday. Power was knocked out to about 50,000 residences and businesses in South Carolina and Georgia as of Sunday afternoon.      \\"Major to localized catastrophic flash flooding along with possible landslides and mudslides in the higher elevations of South Carolina and Georgia remain an ongoing concern,\\" the National Weather Service warned.      Flood warnings also were issued for three Virginia counties. North Carolina also was dealing with flash flooding on some secondary roads, and some ferry services were canceled. But South Carolina was taking the brunt of the unrelenting storm.      Chris Morris is one of the lucky ones in his Charleston neighborhood. He said many neighbors have evacuated, but his family's home is on a raised slab and hasn't been breached. He lives on a golf course, but you would not know that by looking at it.      \\"We woke up this morning to about 10 inches of water surrounding the house,\\" Morris told USA TODAY. \\"And the golf course is completely under water.\\"      The weather service blamed a low pressure system that has stalled over the state since Thursday, combined with the outer edges of Hurricane Joaquin. The Category 2 hurricane, with sustained top winds of 105 mph, avoided a direct hit to the U.S. but did add fuel to rains and high wind along the coast. Joaquin was forecast to lash Bermuda late Sunday and Monday.      South Carolina emergency management officials counseled residents to \\"remain where you are if you are safely able to do so.

City officials said those affected should be prepared to be without potable water from the city system for three to four days. The city issued a boil water advisory for all of its 375,000 customers.      City fire officials said several dams had breached. WLTX-TV meteorologist Jim Gandy said the Village of Sandhill had received 11 inches of rain by 6 a.m. On I-95 in Clarendon County, a 32-mile stretch of road was closed. Parts of Interstate 77 and Interstate 20 also were covered in water.

He assaults and kills several people with a meat hammer, and a butchers hook. He dispatches his prey wordlessly, and with an uncannily unnatural strength. He wears a ring on his finger, adorned with eight stars.We are then introduced to Leon, a vegan photographer who heads into the city's subway system at night to take photographs. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, who he suspects has been killing subway passengers for as long as a hundred years.Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him, and instead cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya, who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest.A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis, a short-order cook, begin to examine the photos Leon has been taking of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment.

Read this and answer the question In military affairs, the use of infantry with specialised roles increased. Along with the still-dominant heavy cavalry, armies often included mounted and infantry crossbowmen, as well as sappers and engineers. Crossbows, which had been known in Late Antiquity, increased in use partly because of the increase in siege warfare in the 10th and 11th centuries.[AB] The increasing use of crossbows during the 12th and 13th centuries led to the use of closed-face helmets, heavy body armour, as well as horse armour.

Among the sites hit was a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital, where seven people were reportedly killed. France said such acts constituted war crimes. Activists have accused Russia of carrying out the strikes but there has been no independent confirmation. Russia has been backing the Syrian government in its offensive against rebels but says it only targets what it calls \\"terrorists\\". Two medical facilities in Maarat al-Numan, which is in Idlib province, are reported to have been hit. MSF said one of its facilities had been struck by four missiles in the space of minutes, leading them to believe it \\"wasn't an accidental attack, that it was deliberate\\". It said seven people died with another eight still missing. Mego Terzian, president of MSF France, told Reuters \\"either the [Syrian] government or Russia\\" was \\"clearly\\" responsible. But the Syrian ambassador to Moscow Riad Haddad, said the US was to blame, a claim the Pentagon dismissed as \\"patently false\\". \\"We have no reason to strike in Idlib, as Isil [Islamic State] is not active there,\\" spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said. A second hospital in Maarat al-Numan was also hit, killing three people, said opposition group the Local Co-ordination Committees.

One of those hit was a children's hospital. A worker for Syria Charity, which runs the facility, blamed Russia. \\"The Russians have been targeting this area because it's what we call a liberated area, by moderate opposition - that's why we are 99% sure this was Russian airstrikes,\\" said Anfal Sevik. Unicef said six children were killed in the strikes on schools. \\"Let us remember that these victims are children,\\" a statement said. \\"Children.\\" Azaz has been the focus of intense fighting, with Turkey on Monday threatening Kurdish rebels with the \\"harshest reaction\\" if they tried to take the town. Despite the bombardment Kurdish-led forces have captured the town of Tal Rifaat from Islamist rebels, the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A statement from UN spokesman spokesman Farhan Haq said the attacks \\"cast a shadow\\" on commitments made by international powers last week. At a conference, world leaders pledged to work towards a cessation of hostilities in Syria within a week. But Russia argues that the \\"cessation\\" does not apply to its air strikes, which have tilted the balance of the war in favour of the Syrian government. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said any ceasefire did not mean \\"each party will stop using weapons\\". In televised comments he questioned whether conditions for the halt in fighting could be met in a week, Reuters reported. France said it condemned the bombing of the MSF clinic in the strongest terms, with Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault saying such acts \\"constitute war crimes\\". The US has also condemned the strikes, saying they cast doubt \\"on Russia's willingness and/or ability to help bring to a stop the continued brutality of the Assad regime against its own people\\". EU foreign policy chief said the attack on the MSF facility was \\"completely unacceptable\\" but did not say who was responsible. The UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is in the capital Damascus as part of his effort to restart peace talks.

This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

It is important to become aware of what is and is not covered for patients under a pre-paid healthcare plan, and how to go about invoicing patients for services that are not covered (or invoicing third parties in cases where that applies). Take your time to become familiar with how the billing process applies to patients and be upfront about any costs that will come out of the patient's pocket. Clear communication and disclosure of costs is important. You will want to know how much money to set aside, when tax payments are due (for example, you may pay taxes quarterly), and the differences in tax filing for a business owner as opposed to an employee of a company. You will have many things that you can write-off as a business owner, so you will want to keep receipts related to your business in a special folder. It is also advisable to use a separate bank account and credit card for all business income and expenses. It is important to consider your long-term financial goals, and to appropriately plan for retirement with a goal age of when you will close your practice, and an idea of the money you will need to sustain your lifestyle. Planning your overall financial goals will help to keep you on track as you begin your own medical practice.

Q:Given the fact that:  When the heart expels more blood with each stroke, the heart has to beat less often in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow.  Answer the question:   If someone has a larger than average physical heart then it will beat more or less in order to pump blood? A:","output":"If someone has a larger than average physical heart, it will likely beat less in order to pump blood.  Step 1: Understanding the fact - When the heart has the ability to expel more blood with each stroke, it can maintain the same volume of blood flow with fewer beats. Step 2: Relating the fact to the question - In the case of a larger than average physical heart, it is more likely that it can expel more blood with each stroke due to the increased volume held within its chambers. Step 3: Making a conclusion - Since the heart can expel a greater volume of blood with each stroke, it will need to beat less in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow as a smaller heart, beating more frequently."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two-and-a-half millennia Answer:","output":"Title: The Forgotten Millennia Genre: Fantasy, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: In a mystical land lost in time, the One Ring, a powerful artifact with the ability to control the forces of darkness and bring its possessor unmatched power, was lost two-and-a-half millennia ago. Rumors and legends have circulated for centuries, but no one has ever managed to find and harness its power. The story begins in the kingdom of Eldarath, ruled by the wise and just Queen Lysandra. Eldarath is facing severe political turmoil, as dark powers are uniting and threatening the peace of the land. The existence of the One Ring is no longer just a legend, as its whispers grow louder in the shadowy corners of the kingdom. According to a cryptic prophecy, a chosen one will be born with the ability to find the One Ring, channel its powers, and restore balance in the world. As the prophecy foretold, a young girl named Emery is born with a mysterious mark on her wrist, resembling the shape of a ring. Her parents, simple farmers, protect her as much as they can, but the darkness that surrounds them creeps closer, threatening their humble life. Years pass, and Emery grows, discovering her unique abilities to influence the elements and control the very nature of magic in the world around her. Her parents, desperate to protect her, reveal her the truth about her destiny. In an attempt to escape the darkness, Emery sets forth on an epic journey to find the One Ring and fulfill her destiny. Along the way, she brings together an unlikely band of misfits: Arlon, a courageous but heartbroken knight exiled from his own kingdom; Thalia, a cunning and resourceful rogue with her own hidden agenda; and Sorrel, a loyal and protective beast with a mysterious connection to Emery's power. Together, they must navigate treacherous landscapes, face off with ruthless villains and terrifying creatures, and ultimately find the One Ring, long lost for two-and-a-half millennia. Unbeknownst to them, the One Ring has its own guardians, ancient spirits compelled to protect the ring at all costs. As Emery and her companions grow closer to their goal, the burden of wielding the One Ring takes a toll on her; the power it holds threatens to corrupt her, and the line between who can be trusted and who cannot grows increasingly blurry. Arlon, Thalia, and Sorrel are not immune to the temptations of the One Ring, and as the group ventures deeper into the heart of darkness, their loyalty will be tested. Ultimately, Emery must battle the shadows within herself and make a heart-wrenching choice: accept the power of the One Ring and restore balance to the world, or risk the complete destruction of everything she loves and holds dear. The Forgotten Millennia is a tale of friendship, hope, and sacrifice. A young girl destined to fulfill an age-old prophecy must confront unimaginable challenges and face the darkness within herself. Our heroes will traverse through a beautiful, dangerous world, fighting against overwhelming odds to save their loved ones and restore the land's equilibrium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There is a forgotten player in the global efforts to limit C02 emissions:the consumer. Households consume one--third of the final energy used in the European Union and produce around two--thirds of city waste.Moreover,food,housing,and private transport account for almost 80%of environmental pressures.So consumers can make a real difference when it comes to fighting climate change. Several factors can direct consumers towards more environmentally--friendly behavior. To achieve this,we need clear and simple information to guide consumption decisions. Indeed.Two thirds of consumers find it difficult to understand which products are better for the environment when shopping.  With 58% of Europeans believing that many companies pretend to be green in order to charge higher prices, industry has a long way to go in helping consumers feet confident when making green choices.They should give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their products,and promote more sustainable behavior among their customers. To be sure, companies are increasingly creating product labels that help consumers make responsible choices--for instance, reminding users of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon--intensive.  Even so,only,20%  of Europeans believe that companies are doing enough to promote environmentally friendly options. In times of crisis, consumers prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style.Durable products might sometimes cost more, but they don't need to be replaced as frequently.

Q:The answer to the question: What was the full name of the person who continued to send troops to Béxar? is inside the article: By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution.

Question: Information:  - Hamelin (or ; German: \\"Hameln\\") is a town on the river Weser in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Hamelin-Pyrmont and has a population of roughly 56,000. Hamelin is best known for the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.  - Josef Kramer ( 10 November 1906 -- 13 December 1945 ) was the Commandant of the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp . Dubbed \`\` The Beast of Belsen '' by camp inmates , he was a notorious German Nazi war criminal , directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people . He was detained by the British army after the Second World War , convicted of war crimes and hanged on the gallows in Hamelin prison by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint .  - Commandant (or ) is a title often given to the officer in charge of a military (or other uniformed service) training establishment or academy. This usage is common in English-speaking nations. In some countries it may be a military or police rank. It is also often used to refer to the commander of a military prison or prison camp (including concentration camps and prisoner of war camps).  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Pied Piper of Hamelin (also known as the Pan Piper, the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the subject character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany. The legend dates back to the Middle Ages, the earliest references describing a piper, dressed in multicolored (\\"pied\\") clothing, who was a rat-catcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refuse to pay for this service, he retaliates by using his instrument's magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others.  - To be hanged, drawn and quartered was from 1351 a statutory penalty in England for men convicted of high treason, although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of King Henry III (12161272). Convicts were fastened to a hurdle, or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where they were hanged (almost to the point of death), emasculated, disembowelled, beheaded and quartered (chopped into four pieces). Their remains were often displayed in prominent places across the country, such as London Bridge. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead burned at the stake.  - The Weser is a river in Northwestern Germany. Formed at Hannoversch Münden by the confluence of the rivers Fulda and Werra, it flows through Lower Saxony, then reaching the Hanseatic-town Bremen (see: Hanseatic League), before emptying further north at Bremerhaven into the North Sea. On the opposite (west) bank is the town of Nordenham at the foot of the Butjadingen Peninsula; thus, the mouth of the river is in Lower Saxony. The Weser has an overall length of . Together with its Werra tributary, which originates in Thuringia, its length is .  - Albert Pierrepoint (30 March 1905  10 July 1992) was a long-serving hangman in England. He executed at least 400 people, including William Joyce (\\"Lord Haw-Haw\\") and John Amery. In Germany and Austria after the war, he executed some 200 people who had been convicted of war crimes. In England, Timothy Evans was hanged by Pierrepoint for a crime committed by his neighbour John Christie, who was also hanged by Pierrepoint.  - Torture (from the Latin \\"tortus\\", \\"twisted\\") is the act of deliberately inflicting physical or psychological pain on an organism in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or compel some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff.  - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence.  - A war crime is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the law of war that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility. Examples of war crimes include intentionally killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages, perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be given, and using weapons that cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.  - A gallows (or scaffold) is a frame, typically wooden, used for execution by hanging, or as a means of torture before execution, as was used when being hanged, drawn and quartered.  - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\".  - John Amery (14 March 1912  19 December 1945) was a British fascist who proposed to the Wehrmacht the formation of a British volunteer force (that subsequently became the British Free Corps) and made recruitment efforts and propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany. He was executed for treason after the war.    What is the relationship between 'josef kramer' and 'torturer'? Answer:","output":"Josef Kramer was a German Nazi war criminal who served as the Commandant of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He was known as \\"The Beast of Belsen\\" due to his cruelty and the inhumane treatment of camp inmates. As a commandant, he was directly responsible for overseeing and implementing the torture, abuse, and murder of thousands of people in the concentration camp.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Emerging data support a role for antibody Fc-mediated antiviral activity in vaccine efficacy and in the control of HIV-1 replication by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Antibody-mediated virus internalization is an Fc-mediated function that may act at the portal of entry whereby effector cells may be triggered by pre-existing antibodies to prevent HIV-1 acquisition. Understanding the capacity of HIV-1 antibodies in mediating internalization of HIV-1 virions by primary monocytes is critical to understanding their full antiviral potency. Antibody isotypes/subclasses differ in functional profile, with consequences for their antiviral activity. For instance, in the RV144 vaccine trial that achieved partial efficacy, Env IgA correlated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. decreased vaccine efficacy), whereas V1-V2 IgG3 correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection (i.e. increased vaccine efficacy). Thus, understanding the different functional attributes of HIV-1 specific IgG1, IgG3 and IgA antibodies will help define the mechanisms of immune protection. Here, we utilized an in vitro flow cytometric method utilizing primary monocytes as phagocytes and infectious HIV-1 virions as targets to determine the capacity of Env IgA (IgA1, IgA2), IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies to mediate HIV-1 infectious virion internalization. Importantly, both broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. PG9, 2G12, CH31, VRC01 IgG) and non-broadly neutralizing antibodies (i.e. 7B2 mAb, mucosal HIV-1+ IgG) mediated internalization of HIV-1 virions. Furthermore, we found that Env IgG3 of multiple specificities (i.e. CD4bs, V1-V2 and gp41) mediated increased infectious virion internalization over Env IgG1 of the same specificity, while Env IgA mediated decreased infectious virion internalization compared to IgG1.

Can you explain to me the enforceability of prenuptial agreements in Indiana?","output":"Hello! In Indiana, prenuptial agreements are generally enforceable as long as certain requirements are met. Here are some key aspects to consider regarding the enforceability of prenuptial agreements in Indiana: 1. Voluntary agreement: The agreement must be entered into voluntarily by both parties without any sign of duress, coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation. It should be a product of each party's free will. 2. Full disclosure: The parties involved in the agreement must provide a fair and reasonable disclosure of their assets, liabilities, and financial obligations. Concealing or withholding important information could potentially weaken the enforceability of the agreement. 3. Fair and reasonable terms: The terms of the prenuptial agreement should be fair and reasonable at the time it was signed. Extreme or unconscionable provisions that greatly favor one party over the other may be considered unenforceable. 4. Independent legal counsel: While not required in Indiana, it is generally advisable for both parties to seek independent legal representation. This ensures that each party fully understands the agreement's implications and that their rights are protected. 5. In writing and signed: To be enforceable, the prenuptial agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties before the marriage takes place. Verbal agreements are usually not enforceable. It is important to note that prenuptial agreements cannot waive a party's obligation to pay child support or define custody arrangements for future children, as these matters are typically determined based on the child's best interests at the time of divorce or separation. To ensure a prenuptial agreement's enforceability in Indiana, it is recommended to consult with a family law attorney who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"Do prenuptial agreements made in Indiana require disclosure of assets?","output":"Yes, in Indiana, prenuptial agreements generally require a fair and reasonable disclosure of assets, liabilities, and financial obligations from both parties. While there is no explicit statutory requirement for disclosure in Indiana, it is widely recommended that both parties provide a full and honest disclosure of their financial situation when entering into a prenuptial agreement. Full disclosure is important because it helps ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of each other's financial circumstances and can make informed decisions regarding the terms of the agreement. Failure to disclose significant assets or liabilities may weaken the enforceability of the agreement, as it may be perceived as unfair or deceptive. To ensure the validity and enforceability of a prenuptial agreement in Indiana, it is advisable for both parties to provide complete and accurate financial disclosures. Consulting with a family law attorney can help you navigate the specific requirements and ensure compliance with the law in your particular situation."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Amber wakes up in her room.

In order to accurately assess the carbon sequestration potential of microalgae, various methods have been developed. Two commonly used methods for evaluating microalgal carbon sequestration are the CO2 fixation rate method and the CO2 removal rate method. The CO2 fixation rate method measures the rate at which microalgae fix CO2 through photosynthesis. This method involves calculating the amount of CO2 absorbed by microalgae per unit time, usually expressed as grams of CO2 fixed per gram of biomass per day. By measuring the growth rate of microalgae and the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the culture medium, the CO2 fixation rate can be determined. This method is particularly useful for determining the potential of different microalgal species in carbon sequestration and comparing their productivity. On the other hand, the CO2 removal rate method focuses on the efficiency of microalgae in removing CO2 from flue gases or other CO2-emitting sources. This method involves measuring the amount of CO2 removed by microalgae per unit time, usually expressed as percentage CO2 removal. By monitoring the CO2 concentration before and after passing through the microalgae culture, the CO2 removal rate can be calculated. This method is essential for evaluating the efficiency of microalgal carbon sequestration in real-world applications, such as power plant flue gas treatment. Both the CO2 fixation rate method and the CO2 removal rate method provide valuable insights into the carbon sequestration potential of microalgae. These methods play a significant role in assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of microalgal carbon sequestration at different stages, ranging from laboratory-scale research to large-scale industrial applications."},{"instruction":"将上文翻译成中文","output":"微藻碳汇是一种减缓大气中二氧化碳（CO2）浓度增加的有希望的策略。为了准确评估微藻碳汇的潜力，已经开发了多种方法。评估微藻碳汇的两种常用方法是二氧化碳固定率法和二氧化碳去除率法。 二氧化碳固定率法测量微藻通过光合作用固定二氧化碳的速率。该方法涉及计算微藻每单位时间吸收的二氧化碳量，通常以每天每克生物质固定的二氧化碳克数表示。通过测量微藻的生长速率和培养基中溶解二氧化碳的浓度，可以确定二氧化碳固定率。这种方法特别适用于确定不同微藻物种在碳汇中的潜力，并比较它们的生产力。 另一方面，二氧化碳去除率法侧重于微藻从烟气或其他二氧化碳排放源中去除二氧化碳的效率。该方法涉及测量微藻每单位时间去除的二氧化碳量，通常以二氧化碳去除率的百分比表示。通过监测通过微藻培养的烟气前后的二氧化碳浓度，可以计算二氧化碳去除率。这种方法对评估微藻碳汇在真实应用中的效率至关重要，例如发电厂烟气处理。 二氧化碳固定率法和二氧化碳去除率法都为评估微藻碳汇的潜力提供了有价值的见解。这些方法在不同阶段评估微藻碳汇的可行性和有效性中起着重要作用，从实验室研究到大规模工业应用。"},{"instruction":"将下面这段话优化为英文的sci综述的内容，并列出文中的引用文献二氧化碳固定率法、二氧化碳去除率法和碳/叶绿素a比值法。二氧化碳固定率法是通过微藻细胞平均含碳量和生长速率的乘积，再乘以二氧化碳和碳的分子量的比值计算得到。目前二氧化碳固定率法是应用较多的微藻碳汇核算方法。Zhu et al.

Please provide the text that you would like me to summarize."},{"instruction":"What is it called in C when you can use the same struct with functions expecting different structs but with the same starting fields?","output":"This concept is called \\"struct compatibility\\" in C. It allows you to use a struct with functions expecting different structs but with the same starting fields. When two structs have the same starting fields in the same order, the compiler treats them as compatible. This means you can assign a pointer to one struct to the other, pass them as arguments to functions expecting the other struct, or use them interchangeably. Here is an example to illustrate the idea: \`\`\`c struct Base { int commonField; }; struct Derived1 { struct Base base; int additionalField; }; struct Derived2 { struct Base base; float additionalField; }; void printBaseField(struct Base* base) { printf(\\"%dn\\", base->commonField); } int main() { struct Derived1 derived1; struct Derived2 derived2; derived1.base.commonField = 10; derived2.base.commonField = 20; printBaseField((struct Base*)&derived1); // Output: 10 printBaseField((struct Base*)&derived2); // Output: 20 return 0; } \`\`\` In the example, \`Derived1\` and \`Derived2\` structs have a \`struct Base\` as their first member, and they have additional fields. The \`printBaseField\` function expects a pointer to \`struct Base\`, but we can pass pointers to \`derived1\` and \`derived2\` by casting them to \`struct Base*\`. The common \`commonField\` is accessed and printed correctly. It's important to note that although struct compatibility allows such interoperability, it's usually safer and more readable to explicitly cast or convert structs to the expected type when passing them to functions. This helps avoid potential pitfalls and improves code clarity."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Amber wakes up in her room. Time for another day in Mondstadt.

She hasn't been moving as much as she usually does. I'm really concerned, Jean.\\" Jean: (concerned) \\"I understand your worries, Amber. Please, have a seat. Let's discuss this.\\" (Amber takes a seat in front of Jean's desk, fidgeting nervously.) Amber: \\"I've been calling her my little firecracker because she's usually so lively and full of energy. But today, it feels different. I'm scared something might be wrong.\\" Jean: \\"I understand your concerns, Amber. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?\\" Amber: (nodding) \\"Well, I've been feeling some discomfort and pressure in my lower abdomen. It's been getting more intense lately. But I thought it was just part of the pregnancy.\\" Jean: \\"That's worth looking into. I think it would be best to do an ultrasound to see how your baby is doing. We have the equipment here in the medical center. Would you like me to have a look?\\" Amber: (relieved) \\"Yes, please. I can't shake this feeling of worry. I just want to make sure she's okay.\\" (Jean escorts Amber to the clinic, where they prepare for the ultrasound.) Sonographer: (kindly) \\"Alright, Amber, lie back and relax. We'll get a clear picture of your baby.\\" (Amber lays down on the examination table, her mind filled with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. The sonographer begins the ultrasound, guiding the device over Amber's belly.) Sonographer: (after a few moments) \\"There she is, your little firecracker. Let me take some measurements and check her position.\\" (Amber holds her breath as she watches the screen, anxiously waiting for any signs of movement.) Sonographer: (concerned) \\"It seems like your baby is in a position more suited for exiting the womb. She's in the breech position. That could be causing the discomfort and reduced movement.\\" Amber: (worried) \\"What does that mean? Is it dangerous for her?\\" Sonographer: \\"In some cases, babies in breech position can be safely delivered, but it does carry some risks. It's best to discuss this further with your doctor and consider the possibility of attempting to turn the baby or discussing options for delivery.\\" Amber: (taking a deep breath) \\"Thank you for being honest with me. I'll definitely talk to Jean about this. I just want what's best for my baby.\\" Sonographer: \\"Of course, Amber. Jean will guide you through the next steps and help you make informed decisions. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\\" (Amber leaves the clinic, her mind now filled with a mix of concern and determination. She knows that Jean will guide her through this unexpected turn in her pregnancy journey and help her make the best decisions for her little firecracker.)"},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

The function is just a piece of code you can reuse. You can implement your own function, but in many cases, you use other people’s functions. In this case, you just have to know how the function works and in some cases how to import the functions. Let the orange and yellow squares represent similar blocks of code. We can run the code using some input and get an output. If we define a function to do the task we just have to call the function. Let the small squares represent the lines of code used to call the function. We can replace these long lines of code by just calling the function a few times. Now we can just call the function; our code is much shorter. The code performs the same task. You can think of the process like this: when we call the function f1, we pass an input to the function. These values are passed to all those lines of code you wrote. This returns a value; you can use the value. For example, you can input this value to a new function f2. When we call this new function f2, the value is passed to another set of lines of code. The function returns a value. The process is repeated passing the values to the function you call. You can save these functions and reuse them, or use other people’s functions. Python has many built-in functions; you don't have to know how those functions work internally, but simply what task those functions perform. The function len takes in an input of type sequence, such as a string or list, or type collection, such as a dictionary or set, and returns the length of that sequence or collection. Consider the following list. The len function takes this list as an argument, and we assign the result to the variable L. The function determines there are 8 items in the list, then returns the length of the list, in this case, 8. The function sum takes in an iterable like a tuple or list and returns the total of all the elements. Consider the following list. We pass the list into the sum function and assign the result to the variable S. The function determines the total of all the elements, then returns it, in this case, the value is 70. There are two ways to sort a list. The first is using the function sorted. We can also use the list method sort. Methods are similar to functions. Let's use this as an example to illustrate the difference. The function sorted Returns a new sorted list or tuple. Consider the list album ratings. We can apply the function sorted to the list album ratings and get a new list sorted album rating. The result is a new sorted list. If we look at the list album ratings, nothing has changed. Generally, functions take an input, in this case, a list. They produce a new output, in this instance, a sorted list. If we use the method sort, the list album ratings will change and no new list will be created. Let's use this diagram to help illustrate the process. In this case, the rectangle represents the list album ratings. When we apply the method sort to the list, the list album rating changes. Unlike the previous case, we see that the list album rating has changed. In this case, no new list is created. Now that we have gone over how to use functions in Python, let’s see how to build our own functions. We will now get you started on building your own functions in python. This is an example of a function in python that returns its input value + 1. To define a function, we start with the keyword def. The name of the function should be descriptive of what it does. We have the function formal parameter \\"A\\" in parentheses. Followed by a colon. We have a code block with an indent, for this case, we add 1 to \\"A\\" and assign it to B. We return or output the value for b. After we define the function, we can call it. The function will add 1 to 5 and return a 6. We can call the function again; this time assign it to the variable \\"c\\" The value for 'c' is 11. Let's explore this further. Let's go over an example when you call a function. It should be noted that this is a simplified model of Python, and Python does not work like this under the hood. We call the function giving it an input, 5. It helps to think of the value of 5 as being passed to the function. Now the sequences of commands are run, the value of \\"A\\" is 5. \\"B\\" would be assigned a value of 6. We then return the value of b, in this case, as b was assigned a value of 6, the function returns a 6. If we call the function again, the process starts from scratch; we pass in an 8. The subsequent operations are performed. Everything that happened in the last call will happen again with a different value of \\"A\\" The function returns a value, in this case, 9. Again, this is just a helpful analogy. Let’s try and make this function more complex. It's customary to document the function on the first few lines; this tells anyone who uses the function what it does. This documentation is surrounded in triple quotes. You can use the help command on the function to display the documentation as follows. This will printout the function name and the documentation. We will not include the documentation in the rest of the examples. A function can have multiple parameters. The function mult multiplies two numbers; in other words, it finds their product. If we pass the integers 2 and 3, the result is a new integer. If we pass the integer 10 and the float 3.14, the result is a float 31.4. If we pass in the integer two and the string “Michael Jackson,” the string Michael Jackson is repeated two times. This is because the multiplication symbol can also mean repeat a sequence. If you accidentally multiply an integer and a String instead of two integers, you won’t get an error. Instead, you will get a String, and your program will progress, potentially failing later because you have a String where you expected an integer. This property will make coding simpler, but you must test your code more thoroughly. In many cases a function does not have a return statement. In these cases, Python will return the special “None” object. Practically speaking, if your function has no return statement, you can treat it as if the function returns nothing at all. The function MJ simply prints the name 'Michael Jackson’. We call the function. The function prints “Michael Jackson.” Let's define the function “No work” that performs no task. Python doesn’t allow a function to have an empty body, so we can use the keyword pass, which doesn’t do anything, but satisfies the requirement of a non-empty body. If we call the function and print it out, the function returns a None. In the background, if the return statement is not called, Python will automatically return a None. It is helpful to view the function No Work with the following return statement. Usually, functions perform more than one task. This function prints a statement then returns a value. Let's use this table to represent the different values as the function is called. We call the function with an input of 2. We find the value of b. The function prints the statement with the values of a and b. Finally, the function returns the value of b, in this case, 3. We can use loops in functions. This function prints out the values and indexes of a loop or tuple. We call the function with the list album ratings as an input. Let's display the list on the right with its corresponding index. Stuff is used as an input to the function enumerate. This operation will pass the index to i and the value in the list to “s”. The function would begin to iterate through the loop. The function will print the first index and the first value in the list. We continue iterating through the loop. The values of i and s are updated. The print statement is reached. Similarly, the next values of the list and index are printed. The process is repeated. The values of i and s are updated. We continue iterating until the final values in the list are printed out. Variadic parameters allow us to input a variable number of elements. Consider the following function; the function has an asterisk on the parameter names. When we call the function, three parameters are packed into the tuple names. We then iterate through the loop; the values are printed out accordingly. If we call the same function with only two parameters as inputs, the variable names only contain two elements. The result is only two values are printed out. The scope of a variable is the part of the program where that variable is accessible. Variables that are defined outside of any function are said to be within the global scope, meaning they can be accessed anywhere after they are defined. Here we have a function that adds the string DC to the parameter x. When we reach the part where the value of x is set to AC, this is within the global scope, meaning x is accessible anywhere after it is defined. A variable defined in the global scope is called a global variable. When we call the function, we enter a new scope or the scope of AddDC. We pass as an argument to the AddDC function, in this case, AC. Within the scope of the function, the value of x is set to ACDC. The function returns the value and is assigned to z. Within the global scope, the value z is set to ACDC After the value is returned, the scope of the function is deleted. Local variables only exist within the scope of a function. Consider the function thriller; the local variable Date is set to 1982. When we call the function, we create a new scope. Within that scope of the function, the value of the date is set to 1982. The value of date does not exist within the global scope. Variables inside the global scope can have the same name as variables in the local scope with no conflict. Consider the function thriller; the local variable Date is set to 1982. The global variable date is set to 2017. When we call the function, we create a new scope. Within that scope, the value of the date is set to 1982. If we call the function, it returns the value of Date in the local scope, in this case, 1982. (click6) When we print in the global scope, we use the global variable value. The global value of the variable is 2017. Therefore, the value is set to 2017. If a variable is not defined within a function, Python will check the global scope. Consider the function \\"AC-DC“. The function has the variable rating, with no value assigned. If we define the variable rating in the global scope, then call the function, Python will see there is no value for the variable Rating. As a result, python will leave the scope and check if the variable Ratings exists in the global scope. It will use this value of Ratings in the global scope within the scope of \\"AC-DC“. In the function, will print out a 9. The value of z in the global scope will be 10, as we added one. The value of rating will be unchanged within the global scope. Consider the function Pink Floyd. If we define the variable Claimed Sales with the keyword global, the variable will be a global variable. We call the function Pink Floyd. The variable claimed sales is set to the string “45 million” in the global scope. When we print the variable, we get a value of “45 million.”","output":"This text discusses the concept of functions in Python. It explains that functions take an input and produce an output or change, and can be reused. Functions can be implemented by yourself or by using other people's functions. The text also mentions the use of built-in functions in Python, such as len() to get the length of a sequence or collection, sum() to get the total of elements in an iterable, and sorted() or the sort() method to sort a list. It provides examples of how these functions are used. The text also explains how to create your own functions in Python. It discusses the syntax of defining a function using the \\"def\\" keyword, specifying parameters, and using the \\"return\\" statement to return a value. It covers the concept of variable scope in functions, including global variables and local variables. It also mentions the use of documentation for functions and the special \\"None\\" object that is returned by a function when it has no return statement.

Using the len() function: \`\`\`python my_string = \\"Hello, World!\\" my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] string_length = len(my_string) list_length = len(my_list) print(string_length) # Output: 13 print(list_length) # Output: 5 \`\`\` 2. Using the sum() function: \`\`\`python my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 10) tuple_sum = sum(my_tuple) print(tuple_sum) # Output: 70 \`\`\` 3. Sorting a list using sorted(): \`\`\`python album_ratings = [8, 5, 9, 7, 6] sorted_ratings = sorted(album_ratings) print(sorted_ratings) # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] \`\`\` 4.

I yearned for us to recapture the magic we once shared, to cherish the precious moments we had left. I desperately wanted us to confront these challenges together, to see it as a battle we fought side by side rather than an argument waged against each other. But with each passing day, hope slips through my trembling fingers, leaving me more desolate than before.

Jean: (frowning) Amber, the baby's position is not ideal. Her head is facing your cervix, which could make a normal delivery very risky. Amber: (worried) Risky? But I can't wait any longer. The pain is too much, and my water just broke. Jean: (calmly reassures her) Alright, alright, stay with me, Amber. We can do this. We'll have to perform an emergency C-section. I'll get the team ready. Amber: (panicking) No, Jean, I can't wait. I can feel her coming. I need to push. Jean: (trying to encourage her) Amber, we have to be careful. It's not safe for you or the baby to deliver naturally in this situation. Trust me, we'll get her out as quickly as possible. (Amidst the chaos and urgency, the medical team rushes into the room, preparing for the emergency C-section. Amber's face contorts with pain as she feels an overwhelming urge to push.) Amber: (gritting her teeth) I can't hold her in any longer, Jean. I have to push. Jean: (urgently) Okay, alright, we're going to support you through this. Everyone, be prepared for an immediate delivery. (The medical team repositions themselves, ready to catch the baby as Amber gives one final, powerful push. With a cry that fills the room, the baby, covered in vernix, is born.) Jean: (excitedly) It's a girl! She's here, Amber! She's healthy, despite the difficulties. Amber: (exhausted but relieved) Our little firecracker. She couldn't wait to join us, it seems. (The medical team wraps the newborn baby in a warm blanket and places her in Amber's arms. Amber's eyes well up with tears as she gazes at her daughter for the first time.) Amber: (whispering) Welcome to the world, my little firecracker. Mommy loves you so much. Jean: (softly) Congratulations, Amber. You did amazing; both of you did. (As the room fills with warmth and joy, Amber and Jean take a moment to celebrate the safe arrival of the newest member of their family.)"},{"instruction":"contexte d’étude de l’analyse conception et la mise œuvre d’un système de gestion des stagiaires à la coordination de stage","output":"L'étude de l'analyse, de la conception et de la mise en œuvre d'un système de gestion des stagiaires à la coordination de stage se situe dans un contexte d'organisation ou d'institution qui accueille régulièrement des stagiaires pour différentes formations.

Voici quelques problématiques courantes : 1. Difficulté à coordonner les différentes formations : L'organisation accueille souvent des stagiaires provenant de différentes formations, ce qui peut rendre complexe la coordination de leurs missions et de leur suivi. Il peut être difficile de s'assurer que chaque stagiaire est bien assigné à une mission en adéquation avec son profil et ses compétences. 2. Manque de visibilité sur les disponibilités des stagiaires : Il peut être difficile de savoir quelles sont les disponibilités de chaque stagiaire, notamment lorsqu'ils sont nombreux et qu'ils suivent des formations variées. Cela peut entraîner des problèmes de surcharge de travail pour certains stagiaires, tandis que d'autres restent inoccupés. 3. Gestion administrative lourde : La gestion des stagiaires nécessite généralement de nombreuses tâches administratives, telles que la réception et le suivi des conventions de stage, la gestion des évaluations, ou encore la communication avec les établissements de formation. Cela peut représenter une charge de travail importante pour les responsables de la coordination des stages. 4. Suivi et évaluation des stagiaires insuffisants : Il peut être difficile de suivre et d'évaluer la progression des stagiaires pendant leur période de stage, notamment en ce qui concerne l'atteinte des objectifs de formation. Le suivi peut également être limité en termes de retour d'information et de soutien aux stagiaires pendant leur période de stage. 5. Manque d'harmonisation des pratiques : Lorsque plusieurs personnes sont impliquées dans la coordination des stages, il peut être difficile d'harmoniser les pratiques et de garantir une gestion cohérente et équitable des stagiaires. Cela peut entraîner des inégalités dans le suivi, l'accompagnement et l'évaluation des stagiaires.

The proposed building would alleviate space constraints on research and educational activities, but it would also add significant debt and interest payments to the budget. You have been contracted by the Board of Trustees to study this problem and make recommendations. Figure 1.1 shows several approaches to study a system that you are considering. (a) 2 PTS Identify a part of the problem that could be studied using an example of non-simulation analysis (actual system, physical model, or analytical model) and explain why. (b) 2 PTS Identify a part of the problem that could be studied using an example of simulation analysis and explain why. (c) 1 PT For your simulation analysis example given above, describe whether it should be static/dynamic and deterministic/stochastic and explain why.","output":"(a) One part of the problem that could be studied using non-simulation analysis is the financial impact of adding significant debt and interest payments to the budget. This can be analyzed using an analytical model, where various financial variables such as interest rates, loan duration, and repayment schedules can be inputted to calculate the impact on the budget. Non-simulation analysis is appropriate for this part of the problem because it involves studying the potential outcomes and consequences of the decision, rather than simulating a dynamic process. (b) One part of the problem that could be studied using simulation analysis is the allocation of space within the proposed building. This can be analyzed using a physical model, where the layout and dimensions of the building can be represented in a scaled-down version. Simulation analysis is appropriate for this part of the problem because it involves the replication of real-world scenarios and the observation of the consequences and interactions of various factors. (c) For the simulation analysis example of studying the allocation of space within the proposed building, it should be dynamic and stochastic. Dynamic simulation analysis would allow for the study of how the allocation of space may change over time as different activities and requirements evolve. Stochastic simulation analysis would account for the uncertainties and variability in factors such as the number of students, faculty members, and research projects, which could impact the allocation of space."},{"instruction":"This question builds on the Tic-Tac-Toe model developed in class.

Inspect the model state and display the string \\"x\\" or \\"o\\" if there is a winner, otherwise display a blank string \\"\\".","output":"(a) The logic that determines whether a Tic-Tac-Toe model state contains a winner is as follows: 1. Check all rows: If any row contains three identical symbols (either \\"x\\" or \\"o\\"), then there is a winner. 2. Check all columns: If any column contains three identical symbols, then there is a winner. 3. Check the diagonals: If either diagonal contains three identical symbols, then there is a winner. (b) Here is a Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe get winner derived state function: \`\`\`python def get_winner(state): # Checking rows for row in state: if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] != \\"\\": return row[0] # Checking columns for col in range(3): if state[0][col] == state[1][col] == state[2][col] != \\"\\": return state[0][col] # Checking diagonals if state[0][0] == state[1][1] == state[2][2] != \\"\\": return state[0][0] if state[0][2] == state[1][1] == state[2][0] != \\"\\": return state[0][2] # No winner return \\"\\" # Example usage state1 = [[\\"x\\", \\"o\\", \\"x\\"], [\\"o\\", \\"o\\", \\"x\\"], [\\"x\\", \\"o\\", \\"x\\"]] winner1 = get_winner(state1) print(winner1) # Prints \\"x\\" state2 = [[\\"x\\", \\"o\\", \\"\\"], [\\"o\\", \\"o\\", \\"x\\"], [\\"x\\", \\"o\\", \\"x\\"]] winner2 = get_winner(state2) print(winner2) # Prints \\"\\" \`\`\` In this implementation, the Tic-Tac-Toe model state is represented as a 2D list where each element is either \\"x\\", \\"o\\", or an empty string (indicated by \\"\\"). The \`get_winner()\` function iterates through the rows, columns, and diagonals to check for a winning pattern. If a winner is found, the corresponding symbol (\\"x\\" or \\"o\\") is returned. If there is no winner, an empty string is returned."},{"instruction":"how to use Excel model this?","output":"To implement the Tic-Tac-Toe get winner derived state function in Excel, you can follow these steps: 1. Open a new Excel spreadsheet and create a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Label each cell with a letter and a number to represent the row and column (e.g., A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.). 2. In one of the cells, enter the following formula to define the state of the board: \`\`\` =IF(A1=\\"\\", \\"\\", A1) \`\`\` Drag this formula across the row and down the column to fill the entire grid. This formula will display the value in each cell if it is not empty; otherwise, it will display an empty string. 3. Create another cell to display the winner. Enter the following formula: \`\`\` =IF( (AND(A1=A2,A2=A3,A1<>\\"\\")), A1, IF( (AND(B1=B2,B2=B3,B1<>\\"\\")), B1, IF( (AND(C1=C2,C2=C3,C1<>\\"\\")), C1, IF( (AND(A1=B1,B1=C1,A1<>\\"\\")), A1, IF( (AND(A2=B2,B2=C2,A2<>\\"\\")), A2, IF( (AND(A3=B3,B3=C3,A3<>\\"\\")), A3, IF( (AND(A1=B2,B2=C3,A1<>\\"\\")), A1, IF( (AND(A3=B2,B2=C1,A3<>\\"\\")), A3, \\"\\" ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) \`\`\` This formula checks each possible winning combination in the Tic-Tac-Toe board and returns the winning symbol (\\"x\\" or \\"o\\") if there is a winner. If there is no winner, it returns an empty string. 4. As you update the values in the cells of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, the winner cell will automatically update to display the winning symbol or an empty string. Please note that when entering the formulas in Excel, you should adjust the cell references in the formulas accordingly based on the actual cell locations of your board. Additionally, make sure to format the cells to align the text in the center for a better visual representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story, which would start from the moment Amber wakes up:] (Amber wakes up in her room.

Time for another day in Mondstadt. But after looking at herself in the mirror, she notices something - her unborn daughter, who Amber's been calling her \\"little firecracker\\", wasn't moving as much as usual, even for 7 months. Concerned, Amber makes her way to Jean's office. But after looking at the ultrasound, they notice that Amber's baby is in a position more suited for exiting the womb - with the head facing Amber's cervix. Just before the ultrasound could be finished, however, Amber suddenly starts to have contractions. But just before the c-section could start, Amber's water breaks - signaling she was going into labor naturally.)","output":"Amber: (frantically) Jean! Oh gods, Jean! I need your help!

Amber's water just broke, and she's in active labor. (Within moments, medical staff arrive and help Amber onto a stretcher, wheeling her hastily towards the delivery room. Amber grips Jean's hand tightly, her face a mix of fear and determination.) Amber: Jean, stay with me. No matter what happens, I need you by my side. Jean: I won't leave you, Amber. I'll be right here. We'll get through this together. (As they rush into the delivery room, the sound of medical equipment and urgent voices fill the air. Amber prepares herself mentally, ready to face whatever awaits in the next few hours. It's a daunting and uncertain journey, but with Jean's support, she knows she can handle anything to bring her precious little firecracker into the world.)"},{"instruction":"Freedom Planet and Naruto characters react to Lilac is Pregnant.

Sharing an \\"order #\\" on Amazon with a friend generally does not pose a significant risk. The order number by itself typically does not contain sensitive information, such as payment details or personal identification. However, it's important to exercise caution and consider a few aspects: 1. Double-check the context: Be sure you trust the person you are sharing the order number with, and ensure that your recipient genuinely needs the order number. This ensures you're not unintentionally sharing any information. 2. Evaluate potential risks: While the order number by itself may not be sensitive, it is advisable to avoid sharing additional information associated with the order, especially if it includes personal information or financial data. 3. Be mindful of phishing attempts: Be cautious if someone requests your order number unexpectedly, especially if it comes from an unknown source. It could be a phishing attempt designed to deceive or scam you. Always verify the identity and intention of the requestor before sharing any information. In general, sharing just the order number should not pose a significant threat, but it's beneficial to exercise discretion and evaluate the specific context before sharing any information related to your Amazon orders."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Amber wakes up in her room.

Esther made the first move, darting forward with lightning speed, her fists tightly clenched. Clarissa, equally quick, gracefully dodged Esther's swift punch, her body flowing like water. The crowd erupted in applause, mesmerized by the seamless fluidity of their movements. Esther, undeterred, launched a series of high kicks, each executed with precision and incredible power. Clarissa skillfully weaved through the onslaught, gracefully avoiding each attack as if she had an innate understanding of Esther's every intent. In perfect harmony with her opponent's movements, Clarissa retaliated with a barrage of powerful strikes that tested Esther's agility and reflexes to the limit. The match was a marvel of contrasting fighting styles – Esther's raw strength pitted against Clarissa's agility and finesse. The sounds of grunts, gasps, and the symphony of fists colliding filled the arena, showcasing the brutal determination of both fighters. As the round progressed, fatigue tugged at their muscles, and sweat glistened on their brows. Despite the physical strain, Esther and Clarissa fought on, their determination blazing brightly in their eyes. Each blow exchanged invoked a lightning-fast counterattack. Their movements became a synchronized dance of power and grace, captivating the audience's attention. With seconds remaining on the clock, Esther summoned her last reserves of energy. She hurled herself forward, fists crashing towards Clarissa with unyielding force. But in a split second, Clarissa used her agility to dodge and gracefully maneuver behind Esther, seizing the perfect opportunity. With a swift and powerful strike to the back of Esther's knee, Clarissa brought her opponent to her knees, toppling her to the canvas. The crowd stood in awe as Esther's body crashed to the mat, the impact vibrating through the arena. As the referee began the countdown, Esther struggled to regain her composure, her chest heaving with exhaustion. With sheer willpower, she managed to rise just as the referee shouted, \\"Ten.\\" The crowd erupted in applause, rising to their feet in a standing ovation for both fighters' sheer tenacity and skill. Esther and Clarissa stood side by side, their bodies battered and bruised, but their spirits unbroken. They locked eyes one final time, their mutual respect shining through the exhaustion, as the crowd chanted their names in unison."},{"instruction":"Eight HD 2012/2013 Schedule Bumper Restoration","output":"To restore the bumper of an 2012/2013 Eight HD, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Gather all necessary tools and materials including a bumper repair kit, sandpaper (various grits), a plastic filler, primer, paint, and clear coat. 2. Begin by removing the bumper from the vehicle. This may require removing screws or clips holding it in place. Consult the vehicle's manual for specific instructions. 3. Clean the bumper thoroughly to remove any dirt, grease, or debris. Use a mild detergent and water solution, and scrub with a soft brush or sponge. 4. Once the bumper is clean and dry, examine it for any cracks, dents, or deep scratches. Use sandpaper to smooth out the damaged areas, starting with a coarse grit to remove any high spots, and gradually moving to finer grits for a smoother finish. 5. If there are any cracks or holes, use a plastic filler to repair them. Apply the filler following the manufacturer's instructions, and allow it to dry completely. 6. Once the filler is dry, sand it down until it is smooth and level with the rest of the bumper surface. 7. After sanding, wipe down the bumper with a clean cloth to remove any dust or residue. 8. Apply a primer to the repaired areas and the entire bumper surface. Allow the primer to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. 9. Once the primer is dry, apply multiple coats of paint to match the original color of the bumper. Allow each coat to dry before applying the next. 10. Finally, apply a clear coat to protect the paint and give the bumper a glossy finish. Allow the clear coat to dry completely before reinstalling the bumper onto the vehicle. It is recommended to consult a professional if you are unsure about any step in the restoration process or if the damage is extensive."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Amber wakes up in her room.

Aquí se explica cómo funciona: 1. Alimentación: El rifle utiliza un cargador desmontable de capacidad variable para cargar los cartuchos .223 Remington o 5.56x45mm OTAN. El cargador se inserta en la parte inferior del receptor. 2. Acción: El Mini-14 Tactical utiliza un sistema de gas con pistón accionado por el retroceso. Cuando se dispara un cartucho, parte de los gases del disparo se desvían a través de un agujero en el cañón y empujan un pistón hacia atrás. El pistón impulsa el portacerrojo hacia atrás, lo que extrae y expulsa el casquillo vacío. 3. Recarga: Al retroceder, el portacerrojo extrae el casquillo vacío y lo expulsa de la recámara. Una vez que el casquillo ha sido expulsado, el portacerrojo se desplaza hacia adelante debido a la tensión del resorte recuperador, y un nuevo cartucho es alimentado en la recámara desde el cargador. 4. Disparo: El gatillo del Mini-14 Tactical está conectado al mecanismo de disparo, que incluye un martillo y un percutor. Cuando el gatillo se aprieta completamente, el martillo golpea el percutor, disparando el cartucho en la recámara. 5. Seguridad: El rifle está equipado con un seguro manual que bloquea el mecanismo de disparo para evitar disparos accidentales. También puede tener un seguro de empuñadura que bloquea el gatillo cuando no se está sujetando el arma. Es importante tener en cuenta que el funcionamiento específico puede variar según el modelo y las modificaciones individuales realizadas en el rifle. Además, siempre es recomendable leer y seguir las instrucciones proporcionadas por el fabricante para un uso seguro y eficiente del Ruger Mini-14 Tactical .223."},{"instruction":"paso a paso el funcionamiento El Ruger Mini-14 Tactical .223","output":"El funcionamiento del Ruger Mini-14 Tactical .223 se puede describir en los siguientes pasos: 1. Carga del cargador: Antes de utilizar el rifle, debe cargar el cargador con los cartuchos adecuados. Asegúrese de seguir las indicaciones del fabricante con respecto a la capacidad y el tipo de cartucho compatible. 2. Inserción del cargador: Una vez que el cargador esté cargado, inserte el cargador en el alojamiento del cargador ubicado en la parte inferior del receptor del rifle. Asegúrese de que esté correctamente colocado y bloqueado en su lugar. 3. Retirada del cerrojo: Para preparar el rifle para su primer disparo, agarre el asa de carga del cerrojo y tírelo hacia atrás y suéltelo. Esto extraerá el cerrojo y también lo volverá a colocar en su posición original. 4. Apertura de la tela: Deslice el seguro manual, que se encuentra en el lateral del receptor, a la posición de \\"Fuego\\". Esto permitirá que el rifle pueda disparar. 5. Apuntar y disparar: Coloque el rifle en posición de apuntar y alinee la mira delantera con la mira trasera adecuadamente. Apunte al objetivo deseado y presione el gatillo de manera segura y controlada. Esto disparará el cartucho en la recámara y expulsará el casquillo vacío. 6. Ciclo de recarga: Después de disparar, el sistema de gas y el mecanismo de retroceso harán retroceder el cerrojo para extraer y expulsar el casquillo vacío. A medida que el cerrojo se desplaza hacia adelante, se alimentará automáticamente un nuevo cartucho desde el cargador a la recámara. El rifle estará listo para disparar nuevamente. 7. Seguro y almacenamiento: Cuando haya terminado de usar el rifle, deslice el seguro manual a la posición \\"Seguro\\" para asegurarse de que el mecanismo de disparo esté bloqueado y no se pueda disparar accidentalmente.

If one more shop is added to the market, the average income per shop reduces by 5 due to price competition. Conversely, the decrease of one shop can increase the average income per shop by 5 due to cartelization among the shopkeepers. Please suggest the optimal number of shops to the city’s revenue department from a total income (revenue) point of view of the market?","output":"Let's assume the optimal number of shops in the market is x. Given that the average income per shop is initially 200 and is reduced by 5 for each additional shop, we can set up the following equation: 200 - 5(x-100) = 200x Simplifying this equation, we get: 200 - 5x + 500 = 200x 700 - 5x = 200x 700 = 205x x ≈ 3.41 Since we cannot have a fractional number of shops, we round down the fraction to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the optimal number of shops would be 3. By having only 3 shops, the average income per shop would increase by 5 due to cartelization among the shopkeepers. This means the average income per shop would be 205, resulting in a total income (revenue) of 615 for the market. Thus, from a total income perspective, the optimal number of shops for the city's revenue department would be 3."},{"instruction":"can you redact that in an original way so i wont be flag for plagiarism","output":"Certainly! Here's an alternative explanation: To determine the optimal number of shops for maximizing the market's total income, we need to find the point where the average income per shop is maximized. Initially, with 100 shops and an average income of 200, the total income is 20,000. Let's assume the optimal number of shops is x. With each additional shop, the average income per shop decreases by 5 due to price competition. So, for every shop added, we subtract 5 from the average income per shop. This relationship can be expressed as: Average income per shop = 200 - (5 * (x-100)). Moreover, if we decrease the number of shops, the average income per shop increases by 5 due to cartelization. So, for every shop removed, we add 5 to the average income per shop. Thus, the expression for the average income per shop becomes: Average income per shop = 200 + (5 * (100-x)). Now, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the average income per shop. We can equate the two expressions: 200 - (5 * (x-100)) = 200 + (5 * (100-x)). Simplifying this equation, we find: 100 - x = 100 - x. This indicates that the value of x does not affect the average income per shop. Therefore, the optimal number of shops, regardless of the starting point, would be 3. With 3 shops in the market, the average income per shop increases by 5 due to cartelization among the shopkeepers. This results in an average income of 205 per shop, leading to a total income (revenue) of 615 for the market. Hence, from a total income perspective, the city's revenue department should aim for 3 shops in the market to maximize revenue."},{"instruction":"make is shorter","output":"To maximize the market's total income, the optimal number of shops is 3.

However, instead of returning the result, it simply prints it. When we call \`add_numbers(3, 4)\`, it computes the sum (which is 7), displays it with \`print()\`, but does not explicitly return anything. Then, we try to assign the result of \`add_numbers(3, 4)\` to the variable \`sum\` and print it out. Since the function does not have a return statement, it implicitly returns \`None\`. Therefore, \`sum\` will be assigned the value \`None\` and when we print it, we will see \`None\` on the console. So, in this example, even though the function doesn't have a return statement, it still returns \`None\` as its implicit return value."},{"instruction":"include comments in the program","output":"Certainly!
