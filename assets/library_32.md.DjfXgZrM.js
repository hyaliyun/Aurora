First Solution: 1. Let's denote the common length of the legs of the triangle by (a). The hypotenuse of such a triangle is (asqrt{2}). 2. Since the perimeter is given by (a + a + asqrt{2}), it follows that:    [    a + a + asqrt{2} = 2a + asqrt{2} = a(2 + sqrt{2})    ]    Thus,    [    a(2 + sqrt{2}) = 2s    ] 3. Solving for (a), we get:    [    a = frac{2s}{2 + sqrt{2}}    ]    To simplify this, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, (2 - sqrt{2}):    [    a = frac{2s (2 - sqrt{2})}{(2 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})} = frac{2s (2 - sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = (2 - sqrt{2})s    ] 4. The area (t) of the triangle is given by:    [    t = frac{1}{2} a^2 = frac{(asqrt{2})^2}{2}    ]    Using (a = (sqrt{2} - 1)s), we get:    [    t = left( frac{a}{sqrt{2}} right)^2 = left( (sqrt{2} - 1)s right)^2     ] 5. Finally, expanding ( (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 ), we find:    [    (sqrt{2} - 1)^2 = 2 - 2sqrt{2} + 1 = 3 - 2sqrt{2}    ]    Hence,    [    t = (3 - 2sqrt{2}) s^2    ] So, the area of the triangle is ( boxed{ (3 - 2sqrt{2}) s^2 } ).  Second Solution: 1. Consider a right-angled isosceles triangle with leg length (2s). The hypotenuse would be (2ssqrt{2}) and the perimeter is:    [    2s + 2s + 2ssqrt{2} = 2s(2 + sqrt{2})    ]    The corresponding area is:    [    t' = frac{1}{2} (2s)^2 = 2s^2    ] 2.

By the theorem which states that the ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths:    [    frac{t}{2s^2} = left(frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{sqrt{2}}right)^2    ]    Simplify:    [    = (sqrt{2}-1)^2 : (sqrt{2})^2    ] 4.

Show that there exists an infinite number of prime numbers dividing at least one of the ( a_{n} ).","output":"1. **Hypothesis and Initial Assumption:**    - Let's denote the polynomial in question as ( f(x) ) with real coefficients.    - Let ( {a_1, a_2, ldots } ) be a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers such that ( a_n leq f(n) ) for every natural number ( n ).    - Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m ) that divide any of the terms in the sequence ( {a_n} ). 2. **Counting the Terms:**    - For any natural number ( n ), we want to count the natural numbers less than or equal to ( f(n) ) that are divisible only by the prime numbers ( {p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m} ).    - Any such number can be expressed as ( p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} ldots p_m^{alpha_m} ) where ( alpha_i ) are non-negative integers. 3. **Bounding the Exponents:**    - We must have ( p_i^{alpha_i} leq f(n) ) for each ( i ).    - Taking the logarithm base 2, this gives us:      [      2^{alpha_i} leq f(n) implies alpha_i leq frac{ln(f(n))}{ln(2)}      ]    - Therefore, the number of possible choices for ( alpha_i ) is at most ( leftlfloor frac{ln(f(n))}{ln(2)} rightrfloor + 1 ). 4. **Total Number of Choices:**    - Since each ( alpha_i ) can vary independently, the total number of different combinations ( (alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_m) ) is:      [      left( leftlfloor frac{ln(f(n))}{ln(2)} rightrfloor + 1 right)^m      ] 5. **Growth Rate and Polynomial Comparison:**    - By the theorem of comparative growth rates (since ( f ) is a polynomial), for sufficiently large ( n ):      [      left( frac{ln(f(n))}{ln(2)} + 1 right)^m < n      ]    - This inequality holds because ( ln(f(n)) ) grows more slowly than ( n ) itself when ( f(x) ) is a polynomial. 6. **Contradiction:**    - Consider the set of natural numbers ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ). These are ( n ) distinct numbers less than ( f(n) ).    - However, based on our assumption, the total number of distinct combinations of ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m } ) that are less than or equal to ( f(n) ) is less than ( n ) for large ( n ). This count is insufficient to cover the ( n ) distinct ( a_i )'s. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Therefore, the assumption that the number of primes dividing any ( a_n ) is finite leads to a contradiction.    - Hence, there must be infinitely many prime numbers that divide at least one of the terms in the sequence ( {a_n} ).

Find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that when ( k ) people are selected from each team, there will be at least 20 people from the same school among all the selected individuals.","output":"1. **Formulating the Problem:**        We are given 120 schools, and each school sends 20 people, forming 20 small teams, where each team consists of one person from each school. We need to find the smallest integer k such that if k people are chosen from each team, there is at least one team with 20 people from the same school within the chosen set of people. 2. **Initial Calculation:**    - The total number of people from each school is 120.    - Supose, no school has 20 people in the chosen set. So, maximum people can be chosen per school is 19. 3. **Forming the Inequality:**    Since there are 20 teams, the number of people we choose from these teams is (20k). Assuming no 20 people come from the same school, the maximum number of people each school can provide is given by 19 times 120.        Therefore, we form the inequality:    [    20k leq 19 times 120    ] 4. **Solving the Inequality:**    Calculate the right-hand side:    [    19 times 120 = 2280    ]    Substitute back to find k:    [    20k leq 2280    ]    [    k leq frac{2280}{20} = 114    ] 5. **Conclusion from the Inequality:**    If k is at most 114, then the condition is satisfied without having 20 people from the same school. Hence, k must be greater than 114 to ensure there are 20 people from the same school within the chosen set. 6. **Case Analysis for ( k geq 115 ):**    - If choosing ( k geq 115 ), then:      [      20k geq 20 times 115 = 2300      ]      Since there are ( 120 times 20 = 2400 ) students in total and each team has 20 students from different schools, selecting 115 from each team leads to a situation where at least one school will have more than 19 representatives.      [      leftlceil frac{2300}{120} rightrceil = 20      ]      By Pigeonhole Principle, at least one school must contribute more than 19 representatives. Thus, ( k = 115 ) implies a guaranteed selection of at least 20 people from the same school. 7. **Verification:**        - Renumbering schools from 1 to 120, and considering sequential positions, we can visualize that with 114 selections, each school avoids having 20 members selected, yet when increased to 115, the smallest integer ( k ) satisfying the condition is 115, ensuring at least one school provides 20 members. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest integer that ensures the given condition is ( boxed{115} )."},{"instruction":"Mr Fletcher hired some men to dig a well in his compound.

Let n denote the number of rectangles contained in the bottom row, calculated by choosing any two of the 1002 vertical lines (at the ends and between each unit square).

Similarly, a rectangle in the bottom row which contains the single shaded square (at position 501 from either end) would have its sides chosen between the 1 to 501 and 502 to 1002 segment.

These lines divide the original square into 4 smaller squares of equal size. 2. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:**    By the pigeonhole principle, if we place 5 points inside the large square, at least two of these points must lie within the same one of the 4 smaller squares. This is because there are 5 points but only 4 smaller squares to place them into, thus ensuring that at least one square must contain at least two points. 3. **Calculating the Maximum Distance:**    Let us denote the side length of the original square ABCD as s. Then, each smaller square will have a side length of frac{s}{2}. The greatest distance between any two points within one of these smaller squares would be the length of the diagonal of that smaller square.  4. **Diagonal Length Calculation:**    The length of the diagonal of a square with side length frac{s}{2} can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a square with side length a, the diagonal (d) is given by:    [    d = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2}    ]    Consequently, for our smaller square with side length frac{s}{2}:    [    d = sqrt{left(frac{s}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{s}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2 left(frac{s}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2} cdot frac{s}{2} = frac{s sqrt{2}}{2}    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    The maximum distance between any two points in the same smaller square within the large square is:    [    frac{s sqrt{2}}{2}    ]    Given that the side length of the larger square is s = 1 (since we can assume this without loss of generality), the maximum distance is:    [    frac{sqrt{2}}{2} < frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} approx 0.707     ] Hence, the distance between some pair of them does not exceed frac{1}{2}.

Note that (c) could be equal to one of (a) or (b), but not both. Suppose (b neq c). 11. **Form a contradiction.**     Replace (A_k) with ({b} cup S_1) and ({c} cup S_2). This forms a new group of mutually disjoint sets (A_1, A_2, cdots, A_{k-1}, A_{k+1}, cdots, A_m, {b} cup S_1, {c} cup S_2) which has strictly more sets, contradicting our initial assumption.

Let's first explore the behavior of ( f ) on the interval ((-1, 0)). Given that ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) is strictly increasing, at most there can be one ( u in (-1, 0) ) such that ( f(u) = u ).     3. Assume such a ( u ) exists. Substitute ( x = y = u ) in the given functional equation:    [    f(u + f(u) + u f(u)) = u + f(u) + u f(u)    ]    Given ( f(u) = u ):    [    f(u + u + u times u) = u + u + u times u    ]    Simplify further:    [    f(u^2 + 2u) = u^2 + 2u    ]     4.

Each number (a_k) (for (k = 1, 2, ldots, 1995)) can be represented as a product of prime factors, i.e., (n_k) (not necessarily distinct). 3. **Adjacent Numbers Property**:    Since each pair of adjacent numbers must have a ratio that is a prime number, this implies that each pair of adjacent numbers differs by exactly one prime factor. 4. **Parity Considerations**:    This means for every (k = 1, 2, ldots, 1994), the numbers (n_k) and (n_{k+1}) must differ in exactly one prime factor.

We check for the smallest ( T ) such that: [ frac{1}{sin (x+T) cos (x+T)} + cos (x+T) = frac{1}{sin x cos x} + cos x ] Observing the behavior: - ( frac{1}{sin x cos x} ) is even and changes sign outside its undefined points every ( pi ). - ( cos x ) retains the same value every ( 2pi ). For both expressions to align perfectly so that all terms contain their original values across the entire function, ( T ) must be able to return the same values for ( cos x ) and maintain sign shifts correctly for ( frac{1}{sin x cos x} ). Thus, ( T = 2pi ) aligns both parts as it coincides with the period of ( cos x ) and matches the double period for sign changes due to ( frac{1}{sin x cos x} ). Conclusion: The graph of ( y = tan x + cot x + cos x ) has a period of ( boxed{2pi} )."},{"instruction":"f overrightarrow {a}=(1，x)， overrightarrow {b}=(x，2) are collinear and have the same direction, then x= ______.","output":"Since the two vectors are collinear,   we have -2=-x^2.

Step 1: Utilize the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences. - Given x_{1} + x_{4} = x_{2} + x_{3} = 0, we deduce 2x_{3} = x_{2} + x_{4}, leading to x_{4} = 3x_{3}. - Since f(x_{1}), f(x_{2}), f(x_{3}), f(x_{4}) form a geometric sequence with frac{f({x}_{4})}{f({x}_{3})}=frac{f({x}_{3})}{f({x}_{2})}=-1, we conclude f(x_{3}) + f(x_{4}) = 0, which simplifies to f(x_{3}) + f(3x_{3}) = 0 for x_{3} > 0. Step 2: Formulate and simplify the equation. - The equation becomes f(x) + f(3x) = ln x + frac{a}{x} + ln (3x) + frac{a}{3x} = 0. - Simplifying, we get -4a = 3xln (3x^{2}).

Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange the formula to find the distance: Distance = Speed × Time We need to convert the time from minutes to hours to match the speed unit (kilometers per hour). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is 30/60 = 0.5 hours. Now we can calculate the distance: Distance = 12 km/h × 0.5 h = 6 km Since the person jogged this distance by going around the perimeter of the field 10 times, we can find the perimeter of the field by dividing the total distance by the number of laps: Perimeter of the field = Distance / Number of laps Perimeter of the field = 6 km / 10 = 0.6 km Now, we need to convert the perimeter into meters because we want the area in square meters. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so: Perimeter in meters = 0.6 km × 1000 m/km = 600 meters Let's denote the width of the field as W and the length as L. We know that L = 2W and the perimeter (P) is the sum of all four sides of the rectangle: P = 2L + 2W Substituting L = 2W into the perimeter formula, we get: 600 meters = 2(2W) + 2W 600 meters = 4W + 2W 600 meters = 6W Now we can solve for W: W = 600 meters / 6 W = 100 meters Since the length is twice the width, L = 2W: L = 2 × 100 meters = 200 meters Now we can find the area (A) of the field: A = L × W A = 200 meters × 100 meters A = 20,000 square meters So, the area of the field is boxed{20,000}  square meters."},{"instruction":"Find the largest positive integer  n  ( n ge 3 ), so that there is a convex  n gon, the tangent of each interior angle is an integer.","output":"1. **Understanding the problem:**    We need to find the largest positive integer ( n ) (where ( n ge 3 )) such that there exists a convex ( n )-gon where the tangent of each interior angle is an integer. 2. **Properties of the tangent function:**    - The tangent function, (tan x), is strictly increasing on the interval (left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)).    - The equation (tan x = k) (where ( k in mathbb{N} )) has solutions in the interval (left(0, frac{pi}{2}right)). 3. **Solutions for (tan x = k):**    - For ( k = 1 ), the solution is ( x_1 = frac{pi}{4} ).    - For ( k ge 2 ), the solutions ( x_k ) lie in the interval (left(frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right)). 4. **Negative tangents:**    - Using the property (tan(pi - alpha) = -tan alpha), the equations (tan x = -k) (where ( k in mathbb{N} )) have solutions ( x'_k = pi - x_k ) in the interval ((0, pi)). 5. **Range of angles:**    - The minimum value of ( x_k ) and ( pi - x_k ) is ( x_1 = frac{pi}{4} ).    - The maximum value of ( x_k ) and ( pi - x_k ) is ( pi - x_1 = frac{3pi}{4} ). 6. **Sum of interior angles:**    - For a convex ( n )-gon, the sum of the interior angles is ((n-2)pi).    - Let (beta_m = pi - alpha_m) be the interior angles of the ( n )-gon.

At the beginning of the game, several white pieces are placed on the leftmost cells, and an equal number of black pieces are placed on the rightmost cells. White and Black take turns to move, with White starting first. A move consists of advancing one of their pieces towards the opponent (White moves right, Black moves left). A piece can either make a simple move or capture an opponent's piece. In a simple move, a piece is moved to any number of empty cells, but it cannot jump over any pieces, whether their own or the opponent's. Capturing follows the same rules as in checkers:  A piece captures an opponent's piece situated on an adjacent cell if the cell immediately beyond it is empty. The capturing piece moves to the empty cell, and the captured piece is removed from the board. Capturing is mandatory: if a capture is possible, a simple move cannot be made instead. If a piece, after capturing an opponent’s piece, can immediately capture another opponent’s piece, it must continue to capture within the same move.

This strategic move places their piece just behind the Black piece, setting up for a potential capture or a positional advantage.    **Conclusion for part (a):** Starting with N = 4, White is in a position to secure a win by playing the optimal move to cell (N-2).  Part b) Players with two pieces each, field length N > 4 1. White needs to attack by moving from positions 2 to (N-3). This move is only feasible if N-3 > 2, i.e., N > 5.

Part c) Players with three pieces each, field length N > 6 1. White should start by moving from 3 to (N-4). This move applies pressure early on and forces exchanges beneficial for White. 2. If N > 8, White can repeat a similar strategy:    - Initiate from 3 to (N-4), proceed with exchanges.    - Then follow up with 2 to (N-5), again forcing advantageous exchanges. 3.

The total number of such edges ( |E_P| ) can be bounded as follows:    [    |E_P| = k - |E_P text{ connected to } P|    ]        Given our earlier result, we have:    [    |E_P text{ connected to } P| geq sum_{i text{ connected to } P} d_i geq frac{4k^2}{n^2}    ]        Thus, we get:    [    |E_P| leq k - frac{4k^2}{n^2}    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, there exists a vertex ( P ) such that:    [    |E_P| leq k left(1 - 4 frac{k}{n^2}right)    ]    [    boxed{text{The required condition is satisfied.}}    ]"},{"instruction":"Jill is painting her toenails and fingernails.

We know that humans typically have 10 fingernails and 10 toenails, making a total of 20, but let's solve it without assuming that. Jill paints 6 nails purple, 8 nails blue, and the rest are striped. So the number of striped nails is ( N - (6 + 8) = N - 14 ). The percentage of nails painted blue is ( frac{8}{N} times 100 ) and the percentage of nails painted striped is ( frac{N - 14}{N} times 100 ). According to the problem, the difference in percentage points between the blue and striped nails is 10. So we can set up the following equation: [ frac{8}{N} times 100 - frac{N - 14}{N} times 100 = 10 ] Simplifying the equation, we get: [ frac{800}{N} - frac{100N - 1400}{N} = 10 ] [ 800 - 100N + 1400 = 10N ] [ 2200 = 110N ] [ N = frac{2200}{110} ] [ N = 20 ] So Jill has boxed{20}  toenails and fingernails in total, which is the typical number for a human being."},{"instruction":"Among the following pairs of functions, which are identical?

First, let's consider the Roman numerals for the first 200 pages. Roman numerals are not based on a positional system and do not use digits in the same way as Arabic numerals, so we cannot simply count digits. Instead, we would need to write out each Roman numeral and count the number of characters used. However, this is a complex and time-consuming task, and you've asked for the number of digits, which typically refers to Arabic numerals. Therefore, we will focus on the Arabic numerals only. For the Arabic numerals, we have pages 201 to 10,000.

Now let's calculate the number of digits for each range: 1. Pages 201 to 999:    There are 999 - 201 + 1 = 799 pages, each with 3 digits.    So, 799 pages * 3 digits/page = 2397 digits. 2.

We rewrite each cube term in terms of its square and linear components: [ x^3 = x^2 cdot x ] [ y^3 = y^2 cdot y ] [ z^3 = z^2 cdot z ] Thus, we can combine these terms together: [ x^2 cdot x + y^2 cdot y + z^2 cdot z - x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0 ] Now, factor out (x^2), (y^2), and (z^2): [ x^2(x-1) + y^2(y-1) + z^2(z-1) = 0 ] To find a general solution for (x), (y), and (z) we will explore some specific simple cases. # Step-by-step specific cases: 1. **Case when (x = y = z = 1):** [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 ] [ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 = 3 ] So, ((1, 1, 1)) is a solution. 2. **Case when (x = y = -1) and (z = 0):** [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 ] [ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^3 + 0^3 = -1 + (-1) + 0 = -2 ] Here, this does not balance, so it’s not a solution. 3. **Case when (x = t), (y = 0), and (z = 0):** [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = t^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = t^2 ] [ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = t^3 + 0 + 0 = t^3 ] Equating, [ t^2 = t^3 implies t^3 - t^2 = 0 implies t^2(t-1) = 0 ] Here, (t = 0) or (t = 1). - For ( t = 0 ): The solution is ((0, 0, 0)) - For ( t = 1 ): The solution is ((1, 0, 0)).

We are also given that the two machines together produce 5W/4 widgets in 3 days. This means that the combined rate of the two machines is (5W/4) widgets / 3 days. Now, let's find the rate of machine X. We are told that it takes machine X alone 24 days to produce 4W widgets. This means that the rate of machine X is 4W widgets / 24 days = W/6 widgets per day.

To show that we can find two of ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) whose sum is divisible by ( p ), follow these steps: 1. **Considering Fractional Parts:**     Express (left{ frac{na}{p} right}, left{ frac{nb}{p} right}, left{ frac{nc}{p} right}, ) and (left{ frac{nd}{p} right}) in terms of their residues modulo ( p ):     [     left{ frac{na}{p} right} = frac{na - k_1p}{p}     ]     for some integer (k_1).

The correct transformation should result in the equation: y = -[(x-1)^{2}] + 4 - 2 y = -(x-1)^{2} + 2 This is the equation of the transformed parabola. 3. **Evaluating the Options** - **Option A: (-2,2)** y = -(-2-1)^{2} + 2 = -9 + 2 = -7 This does not match the given option. - **Option B: (-1,1)** y = -(-1-1)^{2} + 2 = -4 + 2 = -2 This does not match the given option. - **Option C: (0,6)** y = -(0-1)^{2} + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1 This does not match the given option. - **Option D: (1,-3)** y = -(1-1)^{2} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 This does not match the given option. Given the misunderstanding in the transformation step, the correct evaluation should be based on the correctly transformed equation y = -(x-1)^{2} + 2. Let's correct the approach to find which point it actually passes through: - **Correcting the Approach** The correct transformation results in the equation y = -(x-1)^{2} + 2. Let's evaluate the options again with the correct equation: - **Option A: (-2,2)** y = -((-2)-1)^{2} + 2 = -9 + 2 = -7 - **Option B: (-1,1)** y = -((-1)-1)^{2} + 2 = -4 + 2 = -2 - **Option C: (0,6)** y = -((0)-1)^{2} + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1 - **Option D: (1,-3)** y = -((1)-1)^{2} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 It appears there was a mistake in the calculation and interpretation of the shifts in the standard solution. The correct process shows that none of the provided options correctly follows from the described transformations and the corrected calculations. The correct answer should be determined by accurately applying the shifts to the original equation and then evaluating the given points with the corrected equation.

Find the lengths of Train B and Train C.","output":"First, let's find the length of Train B. When two trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed of Train A and Train B is: 120 kmph + 80 kmph = 200 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 200 kmph * (5/18) = 200 * 5/18 m/s = 1000/18 m/s = 55.56 m/s (approximately) The time it takes for Train A and Train B to cross each other is 9 seconds. The distance covered during this time is the sum of the lengths of both trains. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Let L_B be the length of Train B. The total distance covered when they cross each other is: L_A + L_B = Relative Speed * Time 180 meters + L_B = 55.56 m/s * 9 seconds 180 meters + L_B = 500.04 meters Now, we can solve for L_B: L_B = 500.04 meters - 180 meters L_B = 320.04 meters So, the length of Train B is approximately 320.04 meters. Next, let's find the length of Train C. Since Train C crosses Train A at a 45-degree angle, we can consider their relative speed as the speed of Train C because Train A's direction does not affect Train C's crossing time. The speed of Train C is 100 kmph, which we convert to m/s: 100 kmph * (5/18) = 100 * 5/18 m/s = 500/18 m/s = 27.78 m/s (approximately) The time it takes for Train C to cross Train A is 12 seconds. Again, we use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Let L_C be the length of Train C. The distance covered when Train C crosses Train A is the length of Train C: L_C = Speed of Train C * Time L_C = 27.78 m/s * 12 seconds L_C = 333.36 meters So, the length of Train C is approximately boxed{333.36}  meters."},{"instruction":"Given that the point ((3, 4)) is on the graph of ( y = g(x) ), determine a point that must be on the graph of ( 3y = 2g(3x) + 6 ).","output":"From the given point ((3, 4)) on the graph of ( y = g(x) ), we know: [ 4 = g(3) ] Using this information in the transformed function ( 3y = 2g(3x) + 6 ), substitute ( x = 1 ) to find ( y ): [ 3y = 2g(3 cdot 1) + 6 = 2g(3) + 6 = 2 cdot 4 + 6 = 14 ] [ y = frac{14}{3} ] Thus, the point ((1, frac{14}{3})) is on the graph of ( 3y = 2g(3x) + 6 ).

This makes statement B correct in Euclidean geometry, but the question suggests it's incorrect due to misunderstanding the statement's context. **Statement C**: The numbers whose cube roots are equal to themselves can be found by solving the equation x^3 = x.

This means that x lies in the interval [2^n, 2^{n+1}) for some integer n. Since x in (0,1), we are only concerned with negative values of n. 3. **Calculating Individual Probabilities**:    - For lfloorlog_2xrfloor = -1, x must be in [1/2, 1). The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. Since x and y are independent, the probability that both x and y fall in this interval is (1/2) times (1/2) = 1/4.    - For lfloorlog_2xrfloor = -2, x must be in [1/4, 1/2). The length of this interval is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. The probability that both x and y fall in this interval is (1/4) times (1/4) = 1/16. 4. **Generalizing for Any Negative Integer n**:    - For lfloorlog_2xrfloor = n where n is a negative integer, x must be in [2^n, 2^{n+1}). The length of this interval is 2^{n+1} - 2^n = 2^n(2 - 1) = 2^n. The probability that both x and y fall in this interval is (2^n) times (2^n) = 2^{2n}. 5. **Summing the Probabilities**:    - We sum the probabilities for all negative integers n: sum_{n=-1}^{-infty} 2^{2n}. This is a geometric series with the first term a = 2^{-2} = 1/4 and common ratio r = 2^{-2} = 1/4. 6. **Using the Formula for the Sum of an Infinite Geometric Series**:    - The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by S = frac{a}{1 - r} where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Plugging in our values, we get S = frac{1/4}{1 - 1/4} = frac{1/4}{3/4} = frac{1}{3}. 7. **Conclusion**:    - The probability that lfloorlog_2xrfloor=lfloorlog_2yrfloor is boxed{textbf{(D)} frac{1}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Alli rolls a standard 6sided die twice.

Since there are 6 sunny afternoons, we have:    [    n + (7 - m) = 6 quad text{(Equation 2)}    ] 3. **Simplifying Equation 2:**    [    n + 7 - m = 6 implies n + 7 - 6 = m implies n + 1 = m    ]    Thus, we have:    [    m = n + 1 quad text{(Equation 3)}    ] 4. **Solve the system of equations:**    Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:    [    (n + 1) + n = 5 implies 2n + 1 = 5 implies 2n = 4 implies n = 2    ]    Using ( n = 2 ) in Equation 3:    [    m = n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3    ] 5. **Verify the number of days:**    Since ( m = 3 ), there were 3 days with sunny mornings and rainy afternoons.     Since ( n = 2 ), there were 2 days with sunny mornings and sunny afternoons.    Since ( 7 - m = 4 ), there were 4 days with rainy mornings and sunny afternoons.        The total number of days is therefore:    [    m + n + (7 - m) = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9    ] Hence, the least number of days that the holiday could have lasted is: [ boxed{9} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that line l_1 is tangent to the circle x^{2}+y^{2}+2y=0 and is parallel to line l_2: 3x+4y6=0, find the equation of line l_1.","output":"First, rewrite the circle's equation in standard form: x^{2}+(y+1)^{2}=1. Thus, the circle's center is at (0,-1), and its radius r=1. Since line l_1 is parallel to line l_2: 3x+4y-6=0, let line l_1 be represented as 3x+4y+b=0. As line l_1 is tangent to the circle, the distance d from the circle's center to the line is equal to the radius, i.e., frac{|b-4|}{5}=1. Solving for b, we get b-4=5 or b-4=-5, which means b=9 or b=-1. Hence, the equation of the desired line is 3x+4y-1=0 or 3x+4y+9=0. To solve this problem, we first transformed the circle's equation into standard form to find its center and radius r. We then used the relationship between two parallel lines to express line l_1 as 3x+4y+b=0. Since line l_1 is tangent to the circle, the distance d from the circle's center to the line is equal to the radius. We then used the formula for the distance between a point and a line to create an equation in terms of b. Solving this equation gave us the values of b, which allowed us to determine the equation of the desired line. This problem tests our understanding of the relationship between a line and a circle, and involves knowledge of a circle's standard equation, the relationship between two parallel lines, and the formula for the distance between a point and a line. A key aspect of solving this problem is understanding that when a line is tangent to a circle, the distance from the circle's center to the line is equal to the circle's radius.

Prove that the smallest circle, with which any set of lines with a diameter of 1 can be intersected, is a circle with a radius of frac{sqrt{3}}{6} ((approx 0.289)).   Part (a) 1. **Initial Condition and Setup**:     - Let S_{0} be a circle intersecting all n given lines. 2. **Reduction Process**:     - If S_{0} does not touch any of our lines, we can replace it with a concentric smaller circle S_{1} that touches the farthest line from the center of S_{0} (see Figure 179, a). 3. **Reducing Intersection Radius**:     - If S_{1} touches only one of our lines a, we can further reduce S_{1} by maintaining its point of contact with a and moving the center of S_{1} perpendicular to a until the new circle S_{2} touches another line b (see Figure 179, b). 4. **Continuation of Reduction**:     - If S_{2} touches only two non-parallel lines a and b, or if it touches more lines but contains an arc limited by points of contact a and b, we can continue to reduce the intersection circle by moving its center along the angle bisector of lines a and b until it contacts a third line c (see Figure 179, b). 5. **Existence of the Intersecting Circle**:     - Hence, we have a circle S that intersects all lines. It either touches two parallel lines a and b or touches three lines a, b, and c that form a triangle circumscribed around S. 6. **Radius Determination**:     - If there are two parallel lines a and b, the radius of any intersecting circle can’t be less than half the distance between these lines. Therefore, the distance between a and b is at most 2, thus the radius of our circle S is at most 1. 7. **General Case**:     - If there are three lines a, b, and c forming a triangle around S, the radius r must be at most 1, as no point can be farther than r from all three lines (otherwise, no intersecting circle could exist). 8. **Conclusion**:     - In all scenarios described, the initial assertion holds true. Therefore, all lines can be intersected by a circle of radius 1.

Let theta be the measure of each of the two congruent (acute) angles at the base, and phi be the measure of the vertex angle, which is obtuse. 2. **Use the given condition**: The problem states that the product of the lengths of the two congruent sides is equal to the product of the base and twice the triangle's height to the base. This can be expressed as:    [    a^2 = b cdot 2h    ]    where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. 3. **Express base and height in terms of a and theta**: In an isosceles triangle, the base can be split into two equal segments each of length a cos theta. Therefore, the base b = 2a cos theta. The height h from the vertex angle to the base can be expressed as a sin theta.

Since the triangle is obtuse, phi = 180^circ - 2theta must be greater than 90^circ. Thus, if 2theta = 30^circ, then phi = 150^circ. If 2theta = 150^circ, then phi = 30^circ, which is not obtuse. 6. **Conclusion**: The only valid solution for the obtuse angle phi is when 2theta = 30^circ, leading to phi = 150^circ.

Step 2 - Calculate the volumes: - Volume of the cone, V_{text{cone}} = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h = frac{1}{3} pi left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 times 9 = frac{1}{3} pi frac{9}{4} times 9 = frac{81}{12} pi = frac{27}{4} pi. - Volume of the prism, V_{text{prism}} = abh = 3 times 6 times 9 = 162. Step 3 - Find the ratio: The ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism is frac{V_{text{cone}}}{V_{text{prism}}} = frac{frac{27}{4} pi}{162} = frac{27}{4} pi times frac{1}{162} = frac{27 pi}{648} = frac{pi}{24}.

Given that two identical cones are constructed with their vertices at the midpoint of the axis of a cylinder with a height of 2a. 2. The height of the cylinder is H = 2a.

The problem states that the sales grew from 100 vehicles in January to 121 vehicles in March. Since there are two months between January and March, we can model the growth as follows: 1. The sales in February would be 100(1+x), where x is the monthly growth rate. 2. The sales in March, then, would be 100(1+x)^2 because the growth rate applies again to the February sales. Given that the sales in March are 121 vehicles, we set up the equation: [100(1+x)^2 = 121] Dividing both sides by 100 gives us: [(1+x)^2 = 1.21] Taking the square root of both sides, we find two possible values for 1+x: [1+x = pmsqrt{1.21}] [1+x = pm1.1] This gives us two possible values for x: [x_1 = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1] [x_2 = -1.1 - 1 = -2.1] Since a negative growth rate would imply the sales decreased, which contradicts the information given, we discard x_2 = -2.1. Therefore, the monthly average growth rate is: [x = 0.1] Converting this to a percentage: [0.1 times 100% = 10%] So, the monthly average growth rate of sales of this brand of new energy vehicles is boxed{10%}.  Part 2: Calculating the Total Profit from January to March To find the total profit, we first calculate the total number of vehicles sold from January to March.

We are tasked with finding the positive integer pairs left(a_1, a_2right) such that the sequence is periodic. 2. **Analyzing the gcd Sequence**: Let d_n = (a_{n}, a_{n+1}). This leads to d_{n+1} mid a_{n+1} and d_{n+1} mid a_{n+2} by definition. Therefore, d_{n+1} must also divide any linear combination of a_{n+1} and a_{n+2}. Specifically, d_{n+1} divides:    [    d_{n} cdot a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_n    ]    Thus, d_{n+1} divides both a_{n} and a_{n+1}, implying d_{n+1} mid d_n. 3. **Monotonicity of the gcd Sequence**: Since d_{n+1} mid d_n, it follows that:    [    d_{n+1} leq d_n    ]    for all n, meaning the sequence left(d_nright) is monotonically decreasing and must eventually stabilize at a constant value if the original sequence is periodic. 4. **Periodicity of gcd**: Assume left(a_kright) is periodic. Then the sequence of gcd values left(d_kright) also needs to be periodic. Since left(d_kright) is monotonically decreasing, a periodic left(d_kright) implies left(d_kright) is constant:    [    d_1 = d_2 = ldots = d = text{constant}    ] 5. **Evaluating the gcd Values**: Consider the scenarios for the constant gcd d:    - **Case 1: d = 1**: If d = 1, then:      [      a_{n+2} = a_{n} + a_{n+1}      ]      This leads to an increasing sequence because a_{n+2} > a_{n+1} for all n. Such a strictly monotonically increasing sequence cannot be periodic.    - **Case 2: d geq 3**: If d geq 3, then each term in the sequence evolves as:      [      a_{n+2} = frac{a_{n+1} + a_{n}}{d}      ]      Consider:      [      a_{n+3} = frac{a_{n+2} + a_{n+1}}{d} = frac{frac{a_{n+1} + a_{n}}{d} + a_{n+1}}{d} = frac{1}{d^2} a_{n} + left(frac{1}{d^2} + frac{2}{d}right) a_{n+1}      ]      Simplifying and summing:      [      a_{n+3} + a_{n+2} = frac{1}{d^2} a_{n} + left(frac{1}{d^2} + frac{2}{d}right) a_{n+1} < a_{n+1} + a_{n}      ]      This results in a subsequence that is strictly decreasing, contradicting the periodic nature of left(a_kright). 6. **Case 3: d = 2**: If left(a_nright) is periodic, and d = 2, this implies:    [    a_{n+2} = frac{a_{n} + a_{n+1}}{2}    ]    This form suggests each term is the arithmetic mean of the preceding two. Crucially, if a_1 neq a_2,    [    |a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}| = left|frac{a_{n+1} - a_n}{2}right|    ]    implying that for large n:    [    |a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}| = frac{|a_{2} - a_{1}|}{2^n} rightarrow 0    ]    For left(a_nright) consisting of positive integers, eventually, the difference between terms becomes non-integer, contradicting the integer condition.

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on each vertex:    [    sum_{i=1}^{19} d_i^2(u) geq frac{1}{19} left( sum_{i=1}^{19} d_i(u) right)^2 = frac{1}{19} left( 2011 right)^2 = frac{2011^2}{19}    ]    where the total number of edges from each vertex is ( 2011 ). 7. Summing this result for all vertices in ( A cup B ):    [    sum_{u in A} sum_{i=1}^{19} d_i^2(u) + sum_{v in B} sum_{i=1}^{19} d_i^2(v) geq sum_{u in A} frac{2011^2}{19} + sum_{v in B} frac{2011^2}{19} = 2 cdot 2011 cdot frac{2011^2}{19}    ] 8. Therefore:    [    sum_{u in A, v in B} f(u, v) geq frac{2 cdot 2011^3}{19}    ] 9. By the pigeonhole principle, there must exist an edge ( uv ) such that:    [    f(u, v) geq leftlceil frac{frac{2 cdot 2011^3}{19}}{2011^2} rightrceil = 212    ] 10. This implies that there is a monochromatic connected subgraph with at least 212 vertices.     11. Finally, considering disjoint sets and optimal division of vertices ( A ) and ( B ), it is deduced that the configuration to achieve this involves dividing cities into subsets and assigning colors in a strategy-filled manner, guaranteeing at least one monochromatic connected subgraph of 212 vertices.

What's the total number of animals Brinley counted at the zoo?","output":"To calculate the total number of animals Brinley counted at the zoo, we will break down the calculation based on the information given: 1. **Bee-eaters**: There are ten times more bee-eaters than leopards. Since there are 20 leopards, the number of bee-eaters is:    [    10 times 20 = 200    ] 2. **Cheetahs**: There are half as many cheetahs as snakes. Given that there are 100 snakes, the number of cheetahs is:    [    frac{1}{2} times 100 = 50    ] 3. **Alligators**: The number of alligators is twice the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards. First, we find the total number of Arctic foxes and leopards:    [    80 + 20 = 100    ]    Then, the number of alligators is:    [    2 times 100 = 200    ] 4. **Total number of animals**: To find the total, we add the numbers of all the animals together:    [    200 text{ (alligators)} + 200 text{ (bee-eaters)} + 100 text{ (snakes)} + 80 text{ (Arctic foxes)} + 20 text{ (leopards)} + 50 text{ (cheetahs)}     ]    [    = 200 + 200 + 100 + 80 + 20 + 50    ]    [    = 650    ] However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation of the total number of animals.

The equation of the line can be rewritten as y = x + c, to make substitution into the circle's equation easier. Substitute y from the line's equation into the circle's equation:  (x - 1)^2 + (x + c)^2 = 2  Expand and simplify:  x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 2cx + c^2 = 2  Combine like terms and move everything to one side of the equation:  2x^2 + 2cx + c^2 - 2x - 1 = 0  To make this a perfect square (since the line is tangent to the circle and there's only one solution), the discriminant of the quadratic in x must be zero. That is:  b^2 - 4ac = 0  For the quadratic 2x^2 + (2c - 2)x + (c^2 - 1) = 0, identify a = 2, b = 2c - 2, and c = c^2 - 1 and calculate the discriminant:  (2c - 2)^2 - 4(2)(c^2 - 1) = 0  Expand:  4c^2 - 8c + 4 - 8c^2 + 8 = 0  Combine like terms:  -4c^2 + 8c + 12 = 0  Divide by -4 to simplify:  c^2 - 2c - 3 = 0  Factor the quadratic equation:  (c - 3)(c + 1) = 0  Solve for c:  c = 3  or  c = -1  However, we must check which of these values work with the original equations to ensure the line is tangent to the circle. For c = 3: Substitute into the line's equation y = x + 3 and check:  (x - 1)^2 + (x + 3)^2 - 2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 6x + 9 - 2 = 2x^2 + 4x + 8  Since there’s no real x values for which the left side is zero, c = 3 does not satisfy the condition of having just one intersection point with the circle. For c = -1: Similarly, substitute into the line's equation y = x - 1 and check:  (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1)^2 - 2 = 2x^2 - 4x + 2  Again, there won’t be real solutions for x if c = -1, which doesn’t satisfy the original condition either. There's an error in the provided solution that needs correction. The two c values calculated don't actually lead to the line being tangent to the circle. The discriminant should be used correctly with a = 2, b = 2c - 2, and c = c^2 - 1. Consequently, we should recalculate it with these values. Recalculate the discriminant b^2 - 4ac using the correct coefficients:  (2c - 2)^2 - 4(2)(c^2 - 1) = 4c^2 - 8c + 4 - 8c^2 + 8 = -4c^2 + 8c + 12  Divide by -4 to simplify:  c^2 - 2c - 3 = 0  This is the same quadratic equation as before, but we must ensure that it yields the correct values for c. Factoring it again:  (c - 3)(c + 1) = 0  So, now we check these factors against the original equations: Substitute c = 3 into the line equation y = x + 3 and check the intersection with the circle:  (x - 1)^2 + (x + 3)^2 = 2   x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 6x + 9 = 2   2x^2 + 4x + 8 = 2   2x^2 + 4x + 6 = 0  The left side is not equal to zero for any real number x, so the line y = x + 3 is not tangent to the circle. Now, substitute c = -1 into the line equation y = x - 1 and check the intersection with the circle:  (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1)^2 = 2   x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 2   2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 2   2x^2 - 4x = 0   x(x - 2) = 0  Here we have real solutions for x: x = 0 or x = 2. For each of these x values, we have exactly one corresponding y value which means the line is tangent to the circle at two separate points. This is a contradiction to the given condition that there should be only one intersection point. We need to correctly identify the distance from the center of the circle to the line and equate it to the radius of the circle to find the values of c that satisfy the tangency condition. Let the center of the circle be at (1, 0) and the radius be sqrt{2}. The distance from the point (1, 0) to the line x - y + c = 0 is given by the formula:  d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}  where d is the distance from point (x_0, y_0) to the line Ax+By+C=0. For our line x - y + c = 0 and point (1, 0), we have A = 1, B = -1, and C = c. Therefore, the distance is:  d = frac{|1cdot1 -1cdot0+c|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = frac{|1+c|}{sqrt{2}}  Since the line is tangent to the circle, this distance must be equal to the radius sqrt{2} of the circle:  frac{|1 + c|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}  Square both sides:  |1 + c|^2 = 2  Apply the property of absolute value:  (1 + c)^2 = 2  Solve for c:  1 + 2c + c^2 = 2   c^2 + 2c - 1 = 0  This quadratic equation doesn't factor easily so we use the quadratic formula, c = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = 2, and c = -1:  c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}   c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}   c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{8}}{2}   c = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{2}}{2}   c = -1 pm sqrt{2}  These are two distinct solutions, which is unexpected given the problem statement that there should be exactly one point of intersection. We expect only one value for c. To resolve this discrepancy, we'll graph the circle and various lines y = x + c with different c values to visually determine which ones are tangent.  Graphing these, we can observe that with c = -1 + sqrt{2}, the line y = x - 1 + sqrt{2} is tangent to the circle at one point. However, the line y = x - 1 - sqrt{2} intersects the circle at two points, so we discard the latter solution.

Let's analyze each choice: 1. **Option A: (N = 5)**     For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. But since only digits from 1 to 9 can be used, the last digit must be either 5.      - Jia can always avoid creating a number whose last digit is 5 by selecting and placing non-5 digits strategically in the initial turns.

Let the points of tangency on ( BC, CA, AB, AD, BD, ) and ( CD ) be labeled ( A_1, B_1, C_1, A_2, B_2, ) and ( C_2 ) respectively. Suppose ( E ) is the intersection of lines ( B_1C_2 ) and ( B_2C_1 ), and ( F ) is the intersection of lines ( A_1C_2 ) and ( A_2C_1 ). We need to show that lines ( AF, BE ), and ( C_1D ) are concurrent. 1. **Observation of the Relationship:**    To establish the concurrency of the lines, we shall use projective geometry concepts. Due to the nature of the incircles touching each other pairwise, the points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) etc., are tangency points that significantly simplify the geometry into special configurations. 2. **Projective Transformation Analysis:**    Consider mapping the vertices of ( triangle ABC ) via a projective transformation where ( D ) is considered the origin:    - Let ( DA ) be the x-axis.    - Let ( DB ) be the y-axis.    - Let ( DC ) be the z-axis.    Under such a transformation, the problem of the incircles can be reframed with these axes for simplicity in analysis. 3. **Parabola and Circle Involvements:**    Since the incircles touch each other along common tangents, they form parabolic-like structures in this coordinate transformed view. Using projective properties, the x and y axes transform into the tangents of circles, showing properties of tangency points.        - For instance, in the ( xy )-plane, the inscribed circle's tangency involves a tangent ellipse (or parabola); analyzed similarly for other planes. 4. **Intersection Points and Symmetry:**    Let’s determine the precise transformed coordinates for intersections:        - For ( B_1C_2 ) and ( B_2C_1 ), trace their extended lines in new axes. These lines intersect due to tangency radius symmetry, yielding point ( E ).    - Similarly, for ( A_1C_2 ) and ( A_2C_1 ), yielding point ( F ). 5. **Concurrency through Coordinate Alignment:**    Upon these transformations, the crucial point of analysis is the geometry’s symmetry that guarantees:    - ( E ) lies on a line parallel to the x-axis.    - ( F ) lies on a line parallel to the y-axis.    - Combining these with the properties of intersection lines, it is noted that each transformation conserves respective relationships between these points at the origin. 6. **Conclusion on Intersection Point:**    Hence, geometrically and projectively, the intersection of:    - ( B_1C_2 ) and ( B_2C_1 ) (finding ( E ))    - ( A_1C_2 ) and ( A_2C_1 ) (finding ( F ))    - Respectful tangency lines ensuring all intersect at a singular point with concurrent lines being invariant under projective mappings.

We then have no more blocks to fill, but this single case (just using one half-dollar) is excluded. **Using no half-dollars:** 1. **All dimes**: If we use all dimes, we can use 0 to 5 dimes. Each dime covers two blocks. The number of ways we can use 0 to 5 dimes is 6 (0 through 5). 2. **Dimes and Nickels**: If we use fewer than 5 dimes, we can make up the rest with nickels.

To prove that for any natural number ( n ), the equation ( p_n(x) = x ) has ( 2^n ) distinct real solutions, we start by analyzing the function ( p_n(x) ). 3. For ( |x| > 2 ), it clearly holds that ( p_n(x) > x ). Therefore, we restrict our discussion to the domain ( [-2, 2] ). 4. We make use of the substitution ( x = 2 cos t ) where ( t in [0, pi] ). 5. First, to prove by mathematical induction that ( p_n(2 cos t) = 2 cos (2^n t) ):     - **Base Case**: For ( n = 1 ),     [     p_1(2 cos t) = (2 cos t)^2 - 2 = 4 cos^2 t - 2 = 2 cos (2t)     ]     The base case holds true.          - **Inductive Step**: Assume that for ( n-1 ), ( p_{n-1}(2 cos t) = 2 cos (2^{n-1} t) ). 6.

Next, we solve the equation ( p_n(2 cos t) = 2 cos t ), which simplifies to ( 2 cos (2^n t) = 2 cos t ). 8. Hence, we need to solve ( cos (2^n t) = cos t ). The solutions to this, in general form, are:     [     2^n t = pm t + 2 m pi quad (m in mathbb{Z})     ]     This leads to two sets of possible ( t ) values:     [     begin{aligned}     t_k & = frac{2 k pi}{2^n - 1} quad & k = 0, 1, ldots, 2^{n-1} - 1,      s_l & = frac{2 l pi}{2^n + 1} quad & l = 1, 2, ldots, 2^{n-1}.     end{aligned}     ] 9. Clearly, in the intervals ( 0 leq t_k < pi ) and ( 0 < s_l < pi ), these values are distinct. These ( t )-values provide ( 2^n ) distinct solutions. 10. Given that the cosine function is one-to-one in ( [0, pi] ), the values ( 2 cos t_k ) and ( 2 cos s_l ) are distinct for distinct ( t_k ) and ( s_l ). 11. From the definition of ( p_n(x) ), ( p_n(x) = x ) is a ( 2^n )-degree polynomial equation. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, this polynomial has ( 2^n ) roots. 12. Therefore, all solutions ( x_k = 2 cos t_k ) (for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, 2^{n-1} - 1 )) and ( x_l = 2 cos s_l ) ( ( l = 1, 2, ldots, 2^{n-1} )) are distinct and form the ( 2^n ) real solutions of ( p_n(x) = x ). # Conclusion These proves that the equation ( p_n(x) = x ) has ( 2^n ) distinct real solutions for any natural number ( n ).

When the subsets are of the form ({a_1, a_n}, {a_2, a_n}, ldots, {a_{n-1}, a_n}) and ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}}).      2. When ( n = k^2 + k + 1 ) for some integer ( k ), each subset contains ( k + 1 ) elements, and each element is contained in ( k + 1 ) subsets. 6. **Checking the Specific Case for ( n = 50 ):**    - ( 50 ) is not of the form ( k^2 + k + 1 ) for any integer ( k ).    - Therefore, the only possibility is the first scenario where one day all teams but one show up, and on any other day, the last team shows up with just another of the first teams. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Given the structure, on every pair of consecutive days, there must be at least one team that plays on both days. This is because the structure ensures that each team plays against every other team exactly once, and the only way to achieve this is to have overlapping teams on consecutive days.

This can be expressed using the determinant:    [    begin{vmatrix}    x_1 & y_1 & 1     x_2 & y_2 & 1     x_3 & y_3 & 1    end{vmatrix} = 0    ]    For our points ((x, P(x))), ((y, P(y))), and ((z, P(z))), this becomes:    [    begin{vmatrix}    x & P(x) & 1     y & P(y) & 1     z & P(z) & 1    end{vmatrix} = 0    ] 3. **Simplify the determinant:**    Expanding the determinant, we get:    [    x left( P(y) - P(z) right) - y left( P(x) - P(z) right) + z left( P(x) - P(y) right) = 0    ]    Since ( x + y + z = 0 ), we can substitute ( z = -x - y ):    [    x left( P(y) - P(-x-y) right) - y left( P(x) - P(-x-y) right) + (-x-y) left( P(x) - P(y) right) = 0    ] 4. **Analyze the polynomial:**    To satisfy this equation for all ( x ) and ( y ), we need to find a polynomial ( P(x) ) such that the above equation holds. Let's assume ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ):    [    P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0    ]    Since ( P(x) ) must satisfy the collinearity condition for all ( x ) and ( y ), we need to check the degrees of the terms. 5. **Odd function property:**    By shifting ( P ) downwards, we can assume without loss of generality that ( P(0) = 0 ). This implies that ( P(x) ) is an odd function because ( P(-x) = -P(x) ). 6. **Form of the polynomial:**    Given that ( P(x) ) is an odd function, it can only contain odd powers of ( x ). Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be of the form:    [    P(x) = a_1 x + a_3 x^3 + a_5 x^5 + cdots    ]    However, we need to ensure that the collinearity condition is satisfied for all ( x ) and ( y ). The simplest polynomial that satisfies this condition is a cubic polynomial:    [    P(x) = ax^3 + bx    ] 7. **General solution:**    Since we initially shifted ( P ) downwards, we need to add back the constant term ( c ).

The problem states that the point moves 2 units to the left and 3 units down, landing exactly on the origin.

Therefore, moving 2 units to the left changes the x-coordinate from 2a to 2a - 2. 2. **Moving 3 units down**: Moving a point down decreases its y-coordinate. Therefore, moving 3 units down changes the y-coordinate from -3b to -3b - 3. After these movements, the new coordinates of point P are (2a-2, -3b-3).

Let's break this into steps: 1. **Identify Midpoints:**     - Let K be the midpoint of edge SD.     - Thus, KN is the midline of triangle CSD. Therefore,        [       KN parallel CD parallel BM        ]       and        [       KN = frac{1}{2}CD = frac{1}{2}AB = BM       ] 2. **Parallelogram Formation:**     - The quadrilateral BMKN forms a parallelogram.

Therefore, the plane alpha is parallel to the plane DSM.     - The plane intersects the base of the pyramid along a line passing through the center H of the square ABCD, parallel to line DM.     - Let this line intersect AB and CD at points P and Q respectively. 4. **Finding the Points P and Q:**     - Since PH is the midline of triangle BMH, point P is the midpoint of segment BM.     - Point Q divides segment CD, and       [       DQ : QC = 1:3       ] 5. **Intersection Points with Pyramid's Other Edges:**     - The plane alpha intersects face CSD through point Q parallel to DS, so this line intersects edge SC at point F in the ratio       [       SF : FC = 1:3       ]     - Similarly, the plane intersects face SAB at point P parallel to MS, intersecting edge SB at its midpoint L. 6. **Surface Area Calculation:**     - Now, the section alpha forms a quadrilateral PLFQ.     - Let L' and F' be the orthogonal projections of points L and F on the base plane.     - Thus, quadrilateral PL'F'Q is the orthogonal projection of the section onto the base plane.     - Side lengths:       [       PB = frac{1}{3}AB, quad DC = CD = frac{1}{3}CD, quad BL = LS, quad SF = frac{1}{3}SC.       ] 7. **Projected Area Calculation:**     - The original base area of square ABCD is        [       S_{ABCD} = left(frac{8}{sqrt{7}}right)^2 = frac{64}{7}       ]     - Areas of triangles forming the projected quadrilateral:       [       S_{PL'F'Q} = S_{triangle PHB} + S_{triangle BHC} + S_{triangle CHF} = sum frac{1}{32} a^2 = frac{7}{64} a^2 = 1        ] 8. **Finding the Cosine of the Angle:**     - The angle between the base plane and the cutting plane alpha is denoted as phi.     - Since the distance from the apex S to the plane is frac{2}{3}, we utilize trigonometric properties for further calculations.     - Calculating the required error-induced angles using the orthogonality of projections and identities of the cosine function \`cos phi\`.      9. **Final Area Calculation:**     - If E is a perpendicular from center to DM, and HE = left(frac{4}{sqrt{35}}right),       [       cos phi = sqrt{1 - sin^2 phi} = sqrt{1 - frac{35}{36}} = frac{1}{6}       ] Thus, the sought area of the cross-section is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"instruction":"Aaron has some brothers.

Could it be possible that each of these numbers, except one, is equal to the difference of its neighbors?","output":"1. Let us assume that the desired arrangement of 300 positive numbers on a circle exists. Specifically, we assume that each number except one equals the difference of its neighbors. 2. Suppose ( m ) is the greatest number among these 300 positive numbers. Clearly, ( m ) cannot be equal to the difference of its two neighbors since ( m ) is the greatest and the difference cannot exceed ( m ). Hence, only one number, ( m ), does not equal the difference of its neighbors. 3. Let ( d ) be one of the smallest numbers among these 300 numbers. Consider one of the arcs on the circle between ( d ) and ( m ); let the positions on this arc be these consecutive numbers: ( d = a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k = m ). 4. We need to prove by induction on ( i = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ) that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ).     - **Base case** (( i = 0 )): The assertion ( a_1 geq a_0 ) is true as ( d ) is the smallest number.     - **Inductive step**: Suppose that for some ( i < k ), ( a_{i-1} leq a_i ). We have the equation ( a_i = |a_{i-1} - a_{i+1}| ). Given ( a_{i+1} > 0 ) and assuming the correct induction step, it leads to ( a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ). Thus, ( a_{i+1} > a_i ) which completes the inductive step. 5. This implies that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ) for all ( i ). 6. We have established that these numbers increase monotonously from ( d = a_0 ) to ( m = a_k ) on one arc. Similarly, consider the other arc between ( d ) and ( m ); if these numbers are ( d = b_0, b_1, ldots, b_ell = m ), a similar argument shows ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ) for all ( i ). 7. Since ( a_0 = b_0 = d ), we must also have ( d = |a_1 - b_1| ). Assuming without loss of generality ( d = b_1 - a_1 ), we get ( a_2 = a_1 + a_0 ) and consequently, ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 8. The sequences ( a_0, a_1, ldots ) and ( b_0, b_1, ldots ) satisfy ( a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + a_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots ), along with ( b_{i+2} = b_{i+1} + b_i ). 9. Finally, the number ( a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots ). This implies that ( b_ell = a_k ) only when ( k = ell + 1 ), but in such cases, the total number of numbers in the circle would be ( k + ell = 2ell + 1 ), an odd number, which cannot equal 300. 10.

Given the constraint that the difference per step is between 1 and 2, we can determine if it is feasible to reach the triangle labeled 16 through a series of such increments. 4. **Maximum Increment Calculation:**    Considering the sum of maximal possible increments of 2 across the 6 triangle steps:    [    1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13    ]    This shows that even with the maximum incremental difference of 2 at each step, the highest number we could reach from 1 through 6 steps would be 13. 5. **Feasibility Analysis:**    Since the total possible maximum using increments of 2 across 6 steps is 13, and we need to reach the number 16, it is clearly impossible to fit the sequence within the given grid and constraints. # Conclusion: Since it is impossible to make up the number 16 starting from 1 with the constraints provided, the given arrangement and conditions cannot hold for numbering the triangles from 1 to 16 such that differences between neighboring triangles are only 1 or 2.

Since Samson is currently 6 years old, it was 6 - 2 = 4 years ago that he was 2 years old. At that time, Samson's mother was 8 years older than him.

(The distance between the rooks is defined as the distance between the centers of the squares they occupy.)","output":"1. Consider a chessboard with eight rooks placed such that no two rooks attack each other. This implies that no two rooks share the same row or column. 2. Let's examine pairs of rooks placed in neighboring columns. Since each column must contain exactly one rook, we can denote the (i)-th rook's row coordinate in the (j)-th column as (r_{i,j}). 3. Suppose we are considering pairs of rooks from column (j) and (j+1). Let the row coordinates of the rooks in these neighboring columns be (r_{i,j}) and (r_{i,j+1}). 4. The vertical distance between the rooks in columns (j) and (j+1) is ( |r_{i,j} - r_{i,j+1}| ). 5. Since there are exactly 8 columns, there are 7 pairs of neighboring columns to consider (each pair consisting of a column and the column immediately to its right). 6. The possible differences in row coordinates for rooks in neighboring columns can range from 1 to 7 (since there are 8 rows). Due to the Pigeonhole Principle, in these 7 pairings of vertical distances, at least one vertical distance must repeat because we have more pairings than the possible non-distinct values. 7. Therefore, among the pairs of vertical distances, there must be at least one pair that is identical. This ensures that there exist two identical distances among the listed pairs:          [     |r_{i_1,j_1} - r_{i_1,j_1+1}| = |r_{i_2,j_2} - r_{i_2,j_2+1}|     ] 8.

Therefore, frac { sqrt {3}}{2} < sin B < 1.   Then frac {sin (B-A)}{sin Asin B}= frac {sin A}{sin Asin B}= frac {1}{sin B}.   Thus, frac {sin (B-A)}{sin Asin B}= frac {1}{sin B}in(1, frac {2 sqrt {3}}{3}).   Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{D}.   Using the sine rule, we can derive sin C=2sin Acos B+sin A, and since sin C=sin (A+B), substituting gives sin (B-A)=sin A. With A and B being acute angles, we deduce B-A=A, leading to B=2Ain(0, frac {pi}{2}), Ain(0, frac {pi}{4}), and since C=pi-3Ain(0, frac {pi}{2}), we find Ain( frac {pi}{6}, frac {pi}{4}), and thus Bin( frac {pi}{3}, frac {pi}{2}). Substituting into frac {sin (B-A)}{sin Asin B}= frac {1}{sin B} yields the result.

Each number in T can be paired with another number such that the sum of each pair equals 11111_2 + 10000_2 = 101111_2.

Since there are 16 numbers, and they can be grouped into 8 pairs (as each number is paired uniquely), the sum of all numbers in T is 8 times 101111_2. Converting 101111_2 to decimal gives 47.

Step 4: Combining all the terms and simplifying further: begin{align*} e^{ln 2} + lg^2 2 + lg 2 lg 5 + lg 5 &= 2 + 1 + lg 2 cdot lg 5 + lg 5  &= 3 + lg 5 + lg 2 cdot lg 5  &= 3 + lg 5 + (lg 2 + lg 5 - lg (2 times 5))  &= 3 + lg 5 + (lg 2 + lg 5 - lg 10)  &= 3 + lg 5 + lg 2 + lg 5 - 1. end{align*} Step 5: Use the fact that lg 10 = 1 and simplify: begin{align*} 3 + lg 2 + lg 5 &= 3 + lg (2 times 5)  &= 3 + lg 10  &= 3 + 1  &= 4. end{align*} However, we made a mistake at the beginning: lg 2 is not 1, and so lg^2 2 does not equal 1. We need to correct this to get the right answer.  Let's start over the correct way: Step 1: Simplify the exponential term e^{ln 2} to 2. Step 2: Realize that lg^2 2 is actually the square of lg 2 and should remain as it is. Step 3: Use the property that lg a + lg b = lg(ab) to combine the lg 2 and lg 5 terms. Now, let's simplify correctly: begin{align*} e^{ln 2} + lg^2 2 + lg 2 cdot lg 5 + lg 5 &= 2 + lg^2 2 + lg (2 cdot 5) + lg 5  &= 2 + lg^2 2 + lg 10 + lg 5  &= 2 + lg^2 2 + 1 + lg 5  &= 3 + lg^2 2 + lg 5. end{align*} Since lg^2 2 and lg 5 do not combine neatly with the rest, the final simplified expression is: [ boxed{3 + lg^2 2 + lg 5}. ]"},{"instruction":"(Selected Topics on Inequalities) If the solution set of the inequality regarding x, |a1| geq (|2x+1| + |2x3|), is nonempty, then the range of the real number a","output":"The solution set of the inequality regarding x, |a-1| geq (|2x+1| + |2x-3|), being non-empty is equivalent to |a-1| geq min(|2x+1| + |2x-3|) = 4.

Let ( t = a^{1-x^2} ). Then the given equation transforms into:     [     t^2 + (b+4)t + 3b + 4 = 0     ] 2. To ensure that the original equation has no solutions for any ( a > 1 ), the quadratic equation ( t^2 + (b+4)t + 3b + 4 = 0 ) must have no positive solutions. This occurs under two conditions:     - The quadratic equation has no real solutions at all.     - If the quadratic has real solutions, they must be non-positive. 3. Start by considering the condition where the quadratic equation has no real solutions. This is achieved when the discriminant ( D ) is less than zero:     [     D = (b+4)^2 - 4(3b + 4) = b^2 - 4b     ]     Thus, we need:     [     b^2 - 4b < 0 implies b(b-4) < 0     ]     Solving this inequality, we get:     [     0 < b < 4     ] 4. Next, consider the condition where the quadratic equation has real solutions, but both roots are non-positive.

In right triangle OBI (where I is the midpoint of EF), [ OB^2 = OI^2 + BI^2 ] OB = sqrt{2} (radius), OI = sqrt{2} - s/2 (since s/2 is half side length of EFGH), BI = s/2. Substituting, [ 2 = (sqrt{2} - s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying, we find s = sqrt{2/3}. Thus, the area of square EFGH is (sqrt{2/3})^2 = 2/3.

Each person can play tennis, chess, or table tennis with exactly n other people. We need to show that there exist three people who are playing all three different games with each other. 2. **Graph Representation**: Represent each person as a point on a plane. Let's denote this structure as a graph where:    - Each of the 3n + 1 people corresponds to a vertex.    - An edge between two vertices indicates that the two people connected by that edge play a certain game together. Use different colors for different games (e.g., red for tennis, blue for chess, yellow for table tennis). 3. **Drawing the Connections**: For each person, we draw:    - n red edges.    - n blue edges.    - n yellow edges. 4. **Counting Different Game Triangles**: A \\"triangle\\" in this context is a set of three points that are all connected by edges. If any of the three edges is of a different color, it forms a \\"multicolor triangle\\".    - Consider any vertex v. From v, there are 3n edges connecting to 3n other vertices. 5. **Multicolor Triangle Analysis**: If two of the edges connecting a vertex v to other vertices u and w are of different colors, say red and blue, then (v, u, w) forms a multicolor triangle if (u, w) is connected by a yellow edge. Thus, any two edges forming different colors from each vertex contribute to these multicolor triangles.     Each vertex contributes binom{3}{2}n^2 = 3frac{n(n-1)}{2}= 3n^2 multicolor triangles. 6. **Total Multicolor Triangles**: The graph has a total of (3n + 1) vertices:    [    text{Total multicolor triangles} = 3n^2 (3n + 1)    ] 7. **Total Possible Triangles**: The total number of possible triangles (sets of 3 vertices chosen from 3n + 1) is:    [    binom{3n+1}{3} = frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6}    ] 8. **Comparison of Triangles**:    - Since each triangle can have at most 2 multicolor edges, the number of multicolor edges based on 2 multicolor connections is:      [      2 times binom{3n+1}{3} = 2 times frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6}      ]    - Total:      [       3n^2 (3n + 1) quad > quad 2 times frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6}      ] 9. **Conclusion**: Since 3n^2 (3n + 1) is greater than twice binom{3n+1}{3}, there must exist at least one triangle where each of the three edges is a different color, demonstrating that there are three people who each play all three games with each other.

In a normal distribution, the top 5% of scores typically fall at or above a z-score of approximately 1.645 (you can find this value in a standard z-score table or by using a statistical calculator). The z-score is calculated using the formula: [ z = frac{(X - mu)}{sigma} ] where ( X ) is the score, ( mu ) is the mean, and ( sigma ) is the standard deviation. Rearranging the formula to solve for ( X ), we get: [ X = z cdot sigma + mu ] Given that the mean ( mu ) is 60 and the standard deviation ( sigma ) is 10, we can calculate the score that corresponds to the z-score of 1.645: [ X = 1.645 cdot 10 + 60 ] [ X = 16.45 + 60 ] [ X = 76.45 ] So, the score that represents the top 5% cutoff is approximately 76.45. Now, let's consider the \\"within 2 standard deviations of the mean\\" condition. Two standard deviations above the mean would be: [ 60 + 2 cdot 10 = 60 + 20 = 80 ] Since Jack's score must be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, the highest score he could have within this range is 80. To find the lowest score Jack could have received while still being in the top 5% and within 2 standard deviations of the mean, we take the lower of the two values we calculated. Since 76.45 is less than 80, the lowest score Jack could have received is approximately 76.45.

First, note that the condition can be rewritten with c = max(c_1, c_2) + 1, leading to: [ |f(x) + f(y) - f(x+y)| < c ] for all real numbers x, y. This now means there exists some positive c such that the function is bounded by c. We will use this bound condition for the rest of the proof. Without loss of generality, assume that f is monotonically increasing. If we can prove the assertion for a monotonically increasing function, it will also hold for a monotonically decreasing function, since -f also satisfies the given conditions. **Lemma 1**: For all positive integers n and real numbers x, we have: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| < n c ] **Proof**: We proceed by induction on n. - **Base Case**: For n = 1, the statement is trivially true because |f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < c. - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some n geq 1. That is: [ |f((n-1)x) - (n-1) f(x)| < (n-1)c ] We need to prove that: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| < nc ] Using the given condition for f: [ |f(nx) - f((n-1)x) - f(x)| < c ] Then, applying the triangle inequality, we get: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| = |(f(nx) - f((n-1)x) - f(x)) + (f((n-1)x) - (n-1) f(x))| < c + (n-1)c = nc ] Hence, by induction, the lemma is proven. blacksquare Now, define ( g(x) = frac{f(x)}{x} ) for ( x > 0 ).

By Lemma 1, we have: [ |f(ux) - u f(x)| < uc quad text{and} quad |f(v cdot (qx)) - v f(qx)| < vc ] From the second inequality, we get: [ |f(ux) - v f(qx)| < vc ] Applying the triangle inequality again: [ |v f(qx) - u f(x)| < (u + v) c leq 2uc ] Dividing by ( ux ): [ left| frac{v}{u} cdot frac{f(qx)}{x} - frac{f(x)}{x} right| < frac{2c}{x} Rightarrow |g(qx) - g(x)| < frac{2c}{x} ] This establishes the lemma. blacksquare Next, consider the sequence ( {g(n)}_{n=1}^{infty} ). Let ( epsilon > 0 ) and choose ( K = frac{2c}{epsilon} ). For integers ( m, n > K ) and without loss of generality, assume ( m geq n ). By Lemma 2, we have: [ |g(m) - g(n)| = left| g left( frac{m}{n} cdot n right) - g(n) right| < frac{2c}{K} = epsilon ] Thus, by the Cauchy criterion, the sequence ( {g(n)}_{n=1}^{infty} ) is convergent. Let the limit be ( h ). Assume ( f(x) ) takes only non-positive values. Let ( A = -f(0) geq 0 ), then for ( x > 0 ): [ -A leq f(x) leq 0 ] Therefore: [ |g(x)| = frac{-f(x)}{x} leq frac{A}{x} ] Thus for any ( epsilon > 0 ), if ( x > frac{A}{epsilon} ), then ( |g(x)| leq epsilon ), implying: [ lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = 0 ] For the case when ( exists a ) such that ( f(a) > 0 ), then for any ( x > a ), ( f(x) > 0 ). Let's consider ( b = max(a+1, 0) ). If ( x > b ) and ( n = lfloor x rfloor ), then since ( f ) is monotonically increasing: [ frac{f(n)}{n+1} leq frac{f(x)}{x} leq frac{f(n+1)}{n} ] Converting to ( g ): [ frac{n}{n+1} g(n) leq g(x) leq frac{n+1}{n} g(n+1) ] As ( n ) tends to infinity, both sides approach ( h ). This implies that the limit ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) ) exists and is equal to ( h ). In conclusion, the limit ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = k ). Assume for contradiction that ( f(x) - kx ) is not bounded on ( (0, infty) ). Then there exists some ( s > 0 ) such that ( |f(s) - ks| > 2c ). By Lemma 1, for any positive integer ( m ), [ |f(ms) - mf(s)| < mc ] Also: [ |m f(s) - mk s| > 2 mc Rightarrow |f(ms) - mk s| > mc Rightarrow left| frac{f(ms)}{ms} - k right| > frac{c}{s} Rightarrow |g(ms) - k| > frac{c}{s} ] Thus, the sequence ( {g(ms)}_{m=1}^{infty} ) does not converge to ( k ), which contradicts ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = k ). Therefore, the function ( f(x) - kx ) is bounded on ( (0, infty) ). This implies that there exists a positive constant ( M ) such that ( |f(x) - kx| < M ) for ( x > 0 ). For ( x < 0 ), the conditions give: [ |f(x) + f(-x) - f(0)| < c Rightarrow |f(x) + f(-x)| < c + |f(0)| Rightarrow |f(x) - kx + (f(-x) + k(-x))| < c + |f(0)| Rightarrow |f(x) - kx| < c + |f(0)| + M = N ] Since ( N > |f(0)| ) and ( N > M ), we have: [ |f(x) - kx| < N ] for all real ( x ), meaning ( f(x) - kx ) is indeed bounded.

Therefore, he arrived 2 hours after midnight on Monday, meaning he arrived at 2:00 AM on Monday. 2. To find the possible date numbers:     - Since Sasha noticed that the date on Monday matched the number of his train carriage, we should consider the possible dates.     - Given that 2 complete days passed, the journey spans from the end of one month into the beginning of the next.     - Consequently, the potential dates for Monday include the 1st or the 2nd of the month because these are the beginning two days of a new month. 3.

Considering the month transition:     - On Saturday, if the date was at the end (e.g., 30 or 31), it would be greater than the carriage number.      - Thus, the carriage number is likely small. 4.

When Pipe A is filling the tank with the leak, it takes 10 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of Pipe A and the leak is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the tank per hour. We can set up the following equation to represent the situation when the tank is being filled with the leak present: [ A - L = frac{1}{10} ] We know that ( A = frac{1}{6} ), so we can substitute that into the equation: [ frac{1}{6} - L = frac{1}{10} ] Now, we solve for ( L ): [ L = frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{10} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 30 in this case: [ L = frac{5}{30} - frac{3}{30} ] [ L = frac{2}{30} ] [ L = frac{1}{15} ] So, the leak empties the tank at a rate of ( frac{1}{15} ) of the tank per hour.

There are 3 edges for each triangular base, and opposite edges of the top and bottom triangles are parallel. However, each edge of a base triangle forms a skew line with 3 edges from the other base (because they are non-coplanar and non-parallel). Therefore, for the 3 base edges, there are 3 times 3 = 9 pairs of skew lines between the base triangles, which accounts for 9 times 2 = 18 pairs when considering both the top and bottom base triangles. Next, consider the vertices of the top triangle with the vertices of the bottom triangle. Selecting one vertex from the top and a non-directly below vertex from the bottom forms a skew line (since a vertical line connects vertices that are one above the other). There are 3 times 2 = 6 such pairs. Lastly, consider the edge to the diagonal of the opposite face on the side surfaces, each of which is not parallel to the opposite edge—yielding another 6 pairs of skew lines.

Splitting the summation into two parts:    [    y = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k x^2 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k cdot frac{4}{3}    ] 7. Notice these are geometric series. The sum of the geometric series is given by:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k = 3 frac{3^n - 1}{3-1} = frac{3^{n+1} - 3}{2}    ]     8.

Step 1: Vector Representation and Rotation Property - Let point ( A ) be represented by the complex number ( z_1 ). - Let point ( B ) be represented by the complex number ( z_2 ). The vector from ( A ) to ( B ) is given by: [ z_2 - z_1 ]  Step 2: Rotation by ( frac{pi}{3} ) The complex number ( -omega^2 ) has unit length and makes an angle of ( pmfrac{pi}{3} ) with the positive real axis. This is because (omega) represents a primitive cube root of unity; hence, the angles associated with it are ( omega = e^{2pi i / 3} ) and ( omega^2 = e^{-2pi i / 3} ). Multiplying a complex number by ( -omega^2 ) results in a rotation by ( pm frac{pi}{3} ).

Now assume ({1, 2, 3} in X).

We need to demonstrate that M is the midpoint of the segment GH, where H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC.     3. Construct the triangle BMC such that it is extended to form the parallelogram BMCA_1. This requires that MA_1 bisects the side BC. Thus, A_1 lies on the line AM, and AM = MA_1. 4. Given that BA_1 parallel MC and BA_1 perp A'B', and similarly, CA_1 parallel MB and CA_1 perp A'C', it follows that BA_1 and CA_1 are the altitudes of triangle BA'C. Hence, A_1 is the orthocenter of this triangle and A'A_1 perp BC. 5. Considering the perspective triangles BA_1M and A'B'C', where the sides of one triangle are perpendicular to the corresponding sides of the other triangle, these triangles are similar. Consequently, the corresponding lines BC and AG, which contain the medians of these triangles, are perpendicular. 6. Therefore, the line A'G coincides with the line A'A_1. Let G' be the point symmetric to H relative to M. Since triangles AHM and A_1G'M are symmetric about M, we have A_1G' parallel AH perp BC. 7. From this, it follows that G' lies on the line A'G. Similarly, G' lies on the line B'G, so G' = G. 8.

Vertices of the broken lines and these points are in general position (i.e., no three of them lie on a straight line and no three segments connecting them have a common internal point). Each segment (AC, BD, CD,) and (AB) intersects the broken line (a) in an even number of points, and each segment (AD, BC) intersects the broken line (a) in an odd number of points. Conversely, the broken line (b) intersects each of the segments (AC, BD, CD,) and (AB) in an odd number of points, and each of the segments (AD, BC) in an even number of points. Prove that the broken lines (a) and (b) intersect. 1. **Step 1: Coloring the Regions**     Since the vertices and points are in general position, the broken line (a) partitions the plane into regions that can be colored black and white properly (i.e., adjacent regions have different colors). Let the \\"outer\\" region be white.     2. **Step 2: Segment Analysis**    Consider any self-intersection point of the broken line (a). We can lay out the segments (AC, BD, CD,) and (AB) over its edges such that the intersections stay outside a rectangle sufficiently far enough so that all intersection points of (a) with these segments lie outside the rectangle. 3. **Step 3: Constructing Non-self-intersecting Broken Lines**    By systematically performing the above operation for all self-intersection points and coloring the resulting regions white, we ensure the black regions form a union of non-overlapping polygons. Repaint some rectangle parts black to reconstruct (a) as a single polygon without self-intersections. 4. **Step 4: Handling the Non-intersecting Assumption**    If we assume that the broken lines (a) and (b) do not intersect, they divide the plane into three distinct parts. This configuration implies that at least two points must lie in the same part of the plane which contradicts the initial setup where (a) and (b) and their adjacencies separate the points uniquely. 5. **Step 5: Conclusion**    By following a similar methodology to represent (b), proving it through the same steps as (a), we can unveil the logical necessity that (a) and (b) must intersect since their adjacencies cannot be preserved uniquely otherwise. Such an intersection leads to the conclusion that both broken lines intersect as initially claimed. 6. **Conclusion:**    Consequently, the intersection property holds as (boxed{a}) and (boxed{b}) intersect."},{"instruction":"a mathematics class of six students, Mrs. Thompson noticed that after each score was entered into the spreadsheet, the average was always an integer.

Denote the three pairwise non-intersecting subsets as (M_1, M_2), and (M_3). 2. Choose any two consecutive natural numbers, say (A) and (B), such that they belong to different sets without loss of generality. Assume (A in M_1) and (B in M_2). Furthermore, assume (A) is odd and (B) is even (this assumption does not lose generality because one of any pair of consecutive numbers is odd and the other is even). 3. Suppose contrary to the problem statement that every sum (X + Y) belongs to (M_3). 4. For the purpose of the proof, let's consider the sums of the form:    - (A + B in M_3)    - (A + 2B in M_1)    - (A + (2k+1)B in M_3) for some integer (k)        and more such sums. 5. Under this configuration, note the pattern for various sums:    - (2A + B in M_2)    - (3A + B in M_3)    - and similar sums following the algebraic development (2kA + B in M_2) and ((2k+1)A + B in M_3). 6.

Since we assumed that (A + B in M_3) and continues into similar sums following our pattern which intersects to (M_3), it implies:    [    AB + A + B) appears in both (M_1) and (M_3), creating a contradiction as (M_1) and (M_3) are disjoint.

Since f(x) = sin(2x-frac{π}{6}), it's clear that the function's monotonicity changes with the sign of cos(2x-frac{π}{6}). Therefore, we analyze the intervals where the sine function is increasing or decreasing: - For monotonic increase, we set 2kpi -frac{π}{2}leqslant 2x-frac{π}{6}leqslant 2kpi +frac{π}{2}, which simplifies to kpi -frac{π}{6}leqslant xleqslant kpi +frac{π}{3}. - For monotonic decrease, we set 2kpi +frac{π}{2}leqslant 2x-frac{π}{6}leqslant 2kpi +frac{3π}{2}, which simplifies to kpi +frac{π}{3}leqslant xleqslant kpi +frac{5π}{6}. Thus, the monotonic increasing interval of f(x) is [kpi -frac{π}{6}, kpi +frac{π}{3}], and the monotonic decreasing interval is [kpi +frac{π}{3}, kpi +frac{5π}{6}], for kin Z. # Part (2): Range of frac{b+c}{a} Given f(A)=1, we know from part (1) that f(x)=sin(2x-frac{π}{6}). Setting f(A)=1 gives us sin(2A-frac{π}{6})=1. Solving for A, we find: [ 2A-frac{π}{6}=2kpi+frac{π}{2} ] Given A is an angle in an acute triangle, Ain (0,pi), which leads us to A=frac{π}{3}. With C=frac{2π}{3}-B, we can express frac{b+c}{a} as: [ frac{b+c}{a} = frac{sin B+sin(frac{2π}{3}-B)}{sin A} = frac{sqrt{3}sin(B+frac{π}{6})}{sin A} = 2sin(B+frac{π}{6}) ] Considering the constraints of an acute triangle, we find that frac{π}{6}<B<frac{π}{2}, leading to frac{sqrt{3}}{2}<2sin(B+frac{π}{6})leq 1.

We start by analyzing the game to understand how player A can guarantee a win if the initial number N is even. Each turn, player A can choose to either subtract 1 or divide by 2 (if possible), and they can always leave an odd number for player B.  2. When N is even, if N is in the form 4k+2, then dividing by 2 yields 2k+1, which is odd. Player B is then forced to subtract 1, resulting in an even number 2k −1. This process ensures that every turn, player B leaves the number even after their turn, and player A continues until they reach 2, eventually winning. 3. Given this strategy, player A will always win if they play optimally, making strategic moves to halve N rather than subtracting 1 whenever possible, thereby accelerating the approach to 1. 4. To find the smallest even number that requires player A at least 2015 moves, not counting B's moves, we need to calculate how many moves are needed to reach the base number 2, considering that half of the total moves are made by A. 5. We'll define a sequence given by a_0 = 2 and a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 4. The explicit formula for this sequence can be derived. 6. Solve the recurrence relation: [ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 4 ] Given a_0 = 2. 7.

To achieve this, we utilize the structure of binary fractions and consider the dynamics of the grasshopper's movements. 1. **Initial Setup and Problem Definition**      The grasshopper starts at point ( P ). Each move consists of choosing a positive integer ( n ) and jumping ( n ) units either left or right. 2. **Case Analysis: Locations for Guaranteed Trap**    - Let ( P ) be a binary-rational number, expressed in the form ( P = a cdot 2^{-k} ) where ( a ) and ( k ) are natural numbers, and ( 0 < a < 2^k ).    - We need to show that from any binary-rational position ( P ), it is guaranteed that the grasshopper will eventually jump into one of the traps at 0 or 1. 3. **Conversion to Simpler Fractions**    - The key idea is understanding how the grasshopper’s position changes with each jump. Given ( P ) in binary-rational form, the position of the grasshopper will remain binary-rational after every jump.    - Each move effectively changes the grasshopper’s position by adding or subtracting ( n cdot 2^{-k} ). 4. **Convergence to Integer Values**      - If the grasshopper starts at a point ( P = frac{a}{2^k} ) where ( a ) is odd and therefore irreducible, the goal is to show convergence to 0 or 1.    - Consider the smallest distance to either 0 or 1. These positions will double the number of jumps each time, reducing the denominator until the numerator equals 0 or 1. 5. **Proof Steps to Guaranteed Trap**    - Notice: ( P ) distance to 0 or 1 doubles after a relevant jump.    - Inductive reasoning shows that after sufficient jumps, the grasshopper’s position will converge to an integer value of 0 or 1.    - The critical insight is that the denominator will halve, and the numerator will approach 0 or 1 eventually. 6. **Cases for Other Points**      - For points ( P ) that are non-binary-rational within the interval ([0,1]), we declare any ( P ) that are binary-rational as traps.    - The crucial observation here is that for non-binary-rational points ( P ), the grasshopper can always choose ( n ) such that the next point is again non-binary-rational. # Conclusion: The solution thus shows that the grasshopper will eventually land in one of the traps (0 or 1) for every initial valid starting point ( P = a cdot 2^{-k} ) with natural numbers ( a ) and ( k ) and ( 0 < a < 2^k ).

Given the volume of the cone is 27000pi cubic inches, and using the formula for the volume of the cone, V = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h, we can substitute h = 2r into the formula: [ V = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 (2r) = frac{2}{3} pi r^3 ] Set the given volume to this expression: [ frac{2}{3} pi r^3 = 27000 pi ] Divide both sides by pi and solve for r^3: [ frac{2}{3} r^3 = 27000 ] [ r^3 = frac{27000 times 3}{2} = 40500 ] [ r = sqrt[3]{40500} approx 34.3 ] Since h = 2r, we calculate: [ h = 2 times 34.3 approx 68.6 ] Thus, the height of the cone is boxed{68.6} inches."},{"instruction":"To make a lasagna, Martha needs 1.5kg of cheese, 550 grams of meat, 280 grams of pasta, and 2.2kg of tomatoes.

Thus, we can consider the triangle triangle PCP' which has the required lengths PA, PB, PC. 3. **Express coordinates and angles**:    Let angle POA = x, angle POB = y, and thus angle POC = x + y. Since angle AOB = 120^circ (because A, B, and C form an equilateral triangle), it follows that x + y = 120^circ. With R = 2007 and r = 2006, our task centers around evaluating these angles and lengths. 4. **Area calculation using cosine rule**:    To find the area of triangle PCP', use the fact that:    [    left[ PCP' right] = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 right) - [APC] - [AP'P].    ] 5. **Calculate lengths in terms of given radii**:    Using the cosine rule for sides PA, PB, and PC in terms of R and r:    [    PA^2 = R^2 + r^2 - 2Rr cos(120^circ + y).    ]    After simplification, since cos(120^circ + y) = -frac{1}{2}, it turns out:    [    PA^2 = R^2 + r^2 + Rr.    ] 6. **Simplification**:    Similarly, calculate for PB and PC:    [    left[ PCP' right] = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} (R^2 - r^2)     ]    Since R = 2007 and r = 2006:    [    R^2 - r^2 = (2007 + 2006)(2007 - 2006) = 4013 cdot 1 = 4013.    ] 7. **Volume calculation**:    Finally:    [    left[ PCP' right] = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot 4013 = frac{4013 sqrt{3}}{4}.    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    This triangle has an area frac{4013 sqrt{3}}{4}, where a = 4013, b = 3, and c = 4. Summing these gives:    [    a + b + c = 4013 + 3 + 4 = 4020.    ] Thus, the final result is: [ boxed{4020} ]"},{"instruction":"the diagram, triangle ABC is rightangled at A, with AB = 45 and AC = 60.

Hence, it confirms the relationship. Now, calculate the area of triangle ABC: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times AB times AC = frac{1}{2} times 45 times 60 = 1350. ] Since AD is perpendicular to BC, the area of triangle ABC can also be expressed as: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times BC times AD = frac{1}{2} times 75 times AD. ] Equating the two area expressions: [ 1350 = frac{1}{2} times 75 times AD implies AD = 36. ] Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD: [ BD^2 = BC^2 - AD^2 = 75^2 - 36^2 = 5625 - 1296 = 4329. ] So BD = sqrt{4329} = 63. Therefore, the length of BD is boxed{63}."},{"instruction":"a chess tournament, each player played exactly one game against each of the other players. In each game, the winner was awarded 1 point, the loser got 0 points, and each of the two players earned 0.5 points in the case of a tie. After the tournament ended, it was discovered that exactly half of the points earned by each player came from games against the eight players with the least number of total points. (Specifically, each of these eight lowestscoring players earned half of his/her points against the other seven of the eight). How many players were there in total in the tournament?","output":"Let's denote the total number of players in the tournament as ( m + 8 ), where ( m ) represents players excluding the lowest-scoring group of 8 players. Among the ( m ) players: - These players played ({m choose 2}) games, thus collecting ({m choose 2}) points among themselves. - From the problem condition, the same amount of points, ({m choose 2}), was earned by these ( m ) players in games against these weaker 8 players. Now, focusing on the 8 weakest players: - They played ({8 choose 2} = 28) games among themselves, thus scoring 28 points within this group. - Consistently, they should have also scored another 28 points in their games against the ( m ) stronger players. Therefore, the total number of points earned in the tournament ( T ) is given by: [ T = 2{m choose 2} + 56 ] [ T = m(m - 1) + 56 ] This total must equal the total points that can be achieved in the entire tournament which includes all ( m + 8 ) players: [ T = {m + 8 choose 2} = frac{(m + 8)(m + 7)}{2} ] Equating and rearranging, we get: [ 2m^2 - 2m + 112 = m^2 + 15m + 56 ] [ m^2 - 17m + 56 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic we get: [ (m - 8)(m - 7) = 0 ] [ m = 8 quad text{or} quad m = 7 ] Suppose we consider ( m = 8 ) since ( m = 7 ) would give a smaller group equal to the size of the group mentioned, conflicting with the categorization of a weaker group and stronger group.

For the square root to be valid and the equation to hold, we must have sqrt{a-4}=0. This implies that a-4=0. Solving for a, we get: [a-4=0 implies a=4.] 2. Similarly, for the square term, we have ({b-3})^2=0. This implies that b-3=0. Solving for b, we get: [b-3=0 implies b=3.] Given that c=5, we now have the side lengths of the triangle as a=4, b=3, and c=5. To determine the nature of the triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c^2) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a^2 + b^2). Checking this condition, we have: [c^2 = a^2 + b^2 implies 5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2 implies 25 = 16 + 9.] This confirms that triangle ABC is a right triangle, and thus, the largest interior angle, which is opposite the hypotenuse, is a right angle (90^{circ}). Therefore, the largest interior angle of triangle ABC is boxed{90^{circ}}."},{"instruction":"Texas Integrated School has 15 classes and has 20 students per class.
