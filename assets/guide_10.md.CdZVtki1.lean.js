Eleven days after Orsini's assassination attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state. Victoria felt \\"sick at heart\\" to see her daughter leave England for Germany; \\"It really makes me shudder\\", she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters, \\"when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one.\\" Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Kaiser. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How old was Princess Victoria when she wasn't married?","output":"To determine Princess Victoria's age when she wasn't married, we can extract information from the text provided. 1. The text states that Princess Victoria was betrothed in September 1855, when she was 14 years old. 2. Her marriage was delayed until she was 17 years old. Based on the information provided, we can deduce that Princess Victoria wasn't married at any age between her birth and 17 years old. However, the specific age when she wasn't married cannot be pinpointed to a single value, as she wasn't married during multiple years of her life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \\"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\\" Horie told the reporter, \\"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\\" Question: The author wrote the article mainly to   _  . - start an ocean crossing movement - tell us a piece of interesting news - make Horie known to the world - encourage people to learn from Horie A:","output":"tell us a piece of interesting news"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Trust is an integral part of making any sort of relationship work. Yet, in other types of relationships, the ability to see each other physically can keep insecurities at bay. In long-distance relationships when you’re only seeing your partner every couple of weeks or months, it’s easy to become envious of the time they are spending with others. Unless your partner has given you any reason to have distrust, give them the benefit of the doubt and try to keep your jealousies in check. Checking their Facebook or worrying about who’s talking in the background during a phone call can cause resentment. Reconsider if a long-distance relationship is a good choice for you if you continuously have trouble trusting. Normal, face-to-face relationships count on seeing one another and engaging regularly to keep the spark alive. Since you and your partner don’t have the option to do that, it’s important that you are consistent and committed about putting time and effort into the relationship. Establish a pattern or “routine” with your partner in which the both of you can depend on the other to be a constant part of life. Coordinate your schedules so that you know when the other is available. Make an effort to stick to your “routine,” such as calling each other around the same time each day. Maintaining satisfaction on both accounts relies on frequent communication. In order to feel fulfilled in your long-distance relationship it’s essential that the two of you are actively involved in one another’s lives. This doesn’t mean you have to talk all day long, but it does mean you should be willing to share what’s going on in your everyday lives, express your thoughts and opinions, and ask for your partner’s input. A successful long-distance relationship equates to both partners having an understanding of the other’s expectations. Being miles apart becomes even more difficult when you don’t know where you stand in the relationship. This creates an environment that is susceptible to distrust, jealousy, and even infidelity.  Have a talk with your partner to discuss what both of you want from the relationship. Are you in it for the long haul or just casually seeing how things go? Clearly communicate your expectations to your partner and be willing to listen as he or she does the same. You should also discuss romantic boundaries. Some couples opt to allow each other to have physical relationships with others if they are going to be apart for months or years, while other couples would see this as a betrayal. Discuss this with your partner, as you might have different ideas about what is allowed in long-distance You can broach the subject by saying “I really like you and I hope you feel the same. Where do you see us going?” and then being patient as your partner communicates their goals for your long-distance relationship. If your goals do not align, you may have to decide if you want to end the relationship.","output":"Trust is very important for relationships, especially if you live far away from each other. It's normal to feel a little jealous, but try not to worry too much about your partner's friends or check their social media all the time. Talk with your partner about your feelings and plans for the relationship. It's good to have a routine, like calling each other every day at the same time, so you both stay connected. Share what happens in your day and ask your partner about theirs. It's also important to talk about what both of you expect from this relationship, so you both know what's okay and what's not."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we are going to talk about an amazing achievement in the world of football. We will learn about the longest touchdown ever! Isn't that exciting? But before we start, let's quickly learn what a 'touchdown' is. In football, when a player carries the ball into the opponent's end zone or catches it there, we call it a touchdown. It's very exciting and a great way to score points for your team! Now, let's talk about the longest touchdown in the history of football. It happened during a game between two professional football teams, and it was truly amazing! The longest touchdown ever recorded was 109 yards long! Wow! That's almost as long as a football field! This incredible feat was accomplished by two players: Antonio Cromartie and Cordarrelle Patterson. They both did it in separate games, so they share the record. Antonio Cromartie managed this fantastic play on November 4, 2007, when he was playing for the San Diego Chargers against the Minnesota Vikings. Cordarrelle Patterson followed in his footsteps on October 27, 2013, as part of the Minnesota Vikings playing against the Green Bay Packers. Just imagine, these two talented players had to run the whole length of the football field and even a little more to score a touchdown. They were super fast, like superheroes, weren't they?! So now, when someone asks you about the longest touchdown in football history, you can confidently say it was 109 yards long and done by both Antonio Cromartie and Cordarrelle Patterson.

The went back on top at last. \\"Yeah, it's pretty cool. That goes without saying,\\" first baseman Aubrey Huff (FSY) said. Huff hit a three-run homer, Buster Posey (FSY) had a solo shot and San Francisco moved into first place in the division race with a 10-2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday night. \\"It says a lot about this club and how hard they've been fighting,\\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \\"It's going to be a tough race, we know it.\\" Jonathan Sanchez (FSY) (11-8) struck out a career-high 12 as the Giants took a half-game lead on the Padres after San Diego lost 4-0 at St. Louis. San Francisco is in sole possession of first place for the first time since May 6. The Giants are trying to end a six-year playoff drought. \\"Hopefully we can stay there all the way until the end,\\" Sanchez said. \\"It feels good to be in first place. We've got a lot of games to go and we've got to keep playing like this if we're going to finish first.\\" Dodgers starter Ted Lilly (FSY) (8-11) was done after 3⅓ innings for his shortest outing of the season. This was just his third loss in nine starts since joining the Dodgers at the trade deadline. Russ Mitchell homered just fair inside the left-field foul pole for his first career hit leading off the fifth for Los Angeles. He had been 0-for-15. \\"The silent treatment is over,\\" Mitchell said of his funk. \\"I was talking to it, hoping it would stay fair.\\" Huff and Posey connected for back-to-back homers in the third, the seventh time the Giants have hit consecutive homers this season. Jose Guillen (FSY) added a two-run drive in the fifth to make it 8-2. It was his 18th home run of the season and second with the Giants. Guillen returned to the starting lineup after missing Wednesday's game with a painful neck. He underwent an MRI exam Thursday and said everything was fine. Freddy Sanchez (FSY) added a two-run double in the eighth. All the offense helped Jonathan Sanchez win his third consecutive decision. The left-hander, who has been one of the Giants' most reliable starters down the stretch, recorded his seventh career game with double-digit strikeouts and fourth of the season. He allowed four hits and one run in seven innings and didn't walk a batter for the second time in his 30 starts. \\"They're on a roll and swinging the bats,\\" Dodgers manager Joe Torre said. \\"Sanchez was terrific.\\" Sanchez's strikeouts were the second-most by a Giant this year. Tim Lincecum (FSY) struck out 13 at Florida on May 4. Sanchez has one motivation to keep throwing strikes: \\"I just want to win it and make the playoffs,\\" he said. The Giants allowed an unearned run in the first, but Sanchez was unfazed and quickly found his groove. \\"It seems like about a month now he's been throwing strikes and getting ahead,\\" Huff said. \\"When he's doing that, he's one of the most dangerous guys on our staff.\\" Lilly was tagged for five runs and seven hits, and he struck out three and walked one. He had been so reliable for Los Angeles every fifth day that Torre said before the game, \\"Lilly's been such a savior for us in more ways than one.\\" Bochy is using a leadoff man by committee in the absence of the injured Andres Torres (FSY), recovering from an emergency appendectomy Sunday. Edgar Renteria (FSY) took on the job with a lefty starter going and had a triple among his four hits. Milwaukee starts left-hander Randy Wolf (FSY) on Friday night, so Renteria will be in there again Friday night. The Giants captured the season series with the Dodgers 10-8, San Francisco's first series victory against its rivals since going 10-9 in 2005. The teams open the 2011 season facing off for four games at Dodger Stadium from April 1-4, 2011. Los Angeles finished up a 10-game road trip and returned home for a weekend series with the Rockies. Los Angeles faces divisional opponents the rest of the way. Matt Kemp (FSY) struck out in the sixth to match his career high of 153 also done in 2008. NOTES: Torre attended Raiders practice across the Bay in Alameda and spent some time with owner Al Davis in his office. \\"I'll tell you, he's sharp,\\" Torre said. \\"I've known Al a long time. ... It was fun there. You don't realize how big those guys are 'til you're right up next to them.\\" Former Raiders coach John Madden also took Torre around. ... Los Angeles INF Jamey Carroll (FSY) isn't available for a few days because of a sore wrist that he hurt on a swing several days ago. ... Bochy said rookie C Posey could play every day the rest of the way, perhaps getting a break from behind the plate with some starts at first. ... Struggling San Francisco slugger Pablo Sandoval (FSY), in an 0-for-15 funk and 3 for his last 37, sat against an LHP starter and likely won't start Friday either. ... A thick fog hovered over the outfield for the entire game. ... Sanchez became the fourth Giants lefty to strike out 12 or more without a walk since 1920.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes.  - Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United States. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word \\"mishigamaa\\", meaning \\"large water\\" or \\"large lake\\". Michigan is the tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total area (the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River). Its capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit.  - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Vol. 1 : Unreleased ( aka The Official Jay Dee Instrumental Series Vol.1 : Unreleased ) is an instrumental album by the late Detroit record producer , Jay Dee , released in 2002 . The album was compiled by Jay Dee and Waajeed , and is a collection of previously unreleased beats . Two of the tracks on the album , \`\` Busta '' and \`\` L.L.

Although Jay and Busta worked together on numerous occasions , he never worked with LL . It is also possible LL could stand for \`\` Lonnie Lynn '' , the legal name of frequent Jay Dee collaborator Common . Also , it could be entitled 'LL ' because it contains small LL Cool J vocal samples throughout . Vol. 1 is distributed by Bling 47 and is mainly available through their website . This release was followed by Vol.2 : Vintage , three months later .  - Waajeed (born Robert O'Bryant) is a Detroit-born music producer, and one half of the hip hop and R&B group Platinum Pied Pipers, and a founding member of Tiny Hearts. He formed the Bling47 record label in 2002, which has released projects by J Dilla, Waajeed himself, and others.

Determine the sentiment: I loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when I found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued! For years I hung onto my copies of this show, ones that I had taped or had someone tape for me. That is until now. The powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set. Which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about. American Gothic is about good verses evil, basically a struggle between Lucas Buck (that is Buck, with a B). He is an evil sheriff of a South Carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way. I felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived. I really hated when it was canceled, but that is the way it seems to go for me when I finally find something worth watching on television. Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off. The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me.","output":"Analyzing the sentiment step by step: 1. The user starts off with a positive sentiment, expressing their love for the show when it aired on television. 2. The user then displays disappointment and sadness when they found out the show was discontinued, indicating negative sentiment. 3. The sentiment shifts back to positive when the user mentions they managed to get the complete DVD set, expressing excitement and happiness. 4. The user shares the show's theme, which is neutral in terms of sentiment. 5. Positive sentiment is expressed by stating that the show was \\"wonderfully written and directed\\" and had more potential. 6. Negative sentiment appears again when the user says they \\"hated\\" when the show was canceled. 7. Continuing with positive sentiment, the user praises Gary Cole's performance as Sheriff Lucas Buck, as well as the other actors in the show, indicating satisfaction with the casting. After analyzing the text, I conclude that the sentiment is a mix of positive and negative emotions. However, the positive sentiments (love for the show, excitement for the DVD set, praise for writing, direction, and acting) outweigh the negative sentiments (disappointment over cancellation).

Body of the Article: A British police inspector, whose identity remains undisclosed, has received a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of possessing indecent images of children on his home computer. The case has resulted in widespread condemnation from the community and calls for stricter checks on law enforcement personnel. The police inspector's indecent activities came to light during a routine investigation conducted by the cybercrime division of the police force. On discovering the illicit material on the inspector's computer, the cybercrime team promptly notified their superior officers, and disciplinary actions were initiated. The Digital Forensic Unit carefully and meticulously examined the inspector's computer, only to find a significant number of images classified as indecent content involving children. Moreover, the unit concluded that the images had been stored on the device for a substantial period, indicating that this was not a one-time transgression. The victimized children's ages ranged from just a few years old to their early teens, an aspect that only intensifies the horrifying nature of the crime. For someone entrusted with safeguarding society and fighting against such depravities, this discovery is both shocking and heartbreaking. Authorities decided against revealing the name or specific location of the police inspector to protect the ongoing investigation and any connected parties. However, the public has been assured that this case has received widespread attention, and significant actions are being taken to rectify and prevent such instances in the future. The court handed down a suspended prison sentence to the inspector, further explaining that he would be subjected to probation and closely monitored activities during the suspension period. Additionally, his name will be registered on the Sex Offenders Register, thereby preventing him from working with children and vulnerable individuals in the future. This case has generated significant public outrage, with many questioning how someone working within the law enforcement system could engage in such despicable activities. Consequently, demands for greater scrutiny and background checks on police personnel have been made. Conclusion: The suspended prison sentence handed to the police inspector involved in possessing indecent images of children on his home computer sheds light on the importance of ongoing vigilance and the role of the digital forensic unit in combating these heinous crimes. While this incident has further eroded the public's trust in law enforcement, authorities have emphasized their commitment to addressing and rectifying concerns to ensure safety and justice for vulnerable individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Shutter Movie plot: Shutter tells the story of photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new wife Jane (Rachael Taylor). The film begins with the couple's wedding, and the audience learns that they are planning to leave their apartment in Brooklyn for Japan, where Ben has been hired to take pictures for a particular client. The couple has made the decision to leave for Japan a few days early, renting a cabin so they can enjoy a shorter honeymoon. In the car on the way to the cabin, Jane gets lost and asks a sleeping Ben to check the map. While attempting to get their bearings, Jane sees a girl walk into the road. She hits the girl, and swerves off the road, crashing the car into a tree. They both fall unconscious. When she awakens, Jane realizes the girl could very well still be laying in the road, and rushes out of the car to find her, Ben on her heels. They find nothing, and Ben thinks that the girl was already found and has gotten the medical help that she would need. He also thinks the injuries weren't life-threatening, as they cannot find any blood or evidence of a collision and wants to call for help. Later, help does arrive for them, and they are able to continue with their travel to the cabin, but Jane is haunted by the image of the girl. Ben's shoulder is bothering him, since the accident. Jane tells him he needs to get it checked out. Ben chooses to ignore it, and at the cabin, they are able to enjoy a few day long honeymoon, and Ben wants to take pictures to record the event.Days later, Ben has to report for work with his friend Bruno (David Denman) Jane accompanies him but is somewhat left to her own devices as Ben needs to meet with the clients right away. We learn that Ben is fluent in Japanese, while Jane is not. Later, the pair are taken to their home, a building of which they are the solo occupants, and also the home of Ben's photography studio. Jane notices an alcove where an old chair sits, and the image sticks with her. After meeting Ben's assistant Seiko (Maya Hazen), Jane again is left to her own devices... Answer:","output":"Ben's occupation in the movie \\"Shutter\\" is a professional photographer. His proficiency in this occupation is significant enough to have him be hired by a client in Japan, where he moves to with his new wife, Jane. Moreover, his job as a photographer also necessitated him being fluent in Japanese to namely interact with clients. He seems to possess a dedicated photography studio in his new home in Japan as well. His photographic skills aren't relegated strictly to professional settings though, he also enjoys taking personal pictures, such as those to record their few days long honeymoon. His deep interest in the field is further hinted when even after getting injured in a car accident, Ben chooses to ignore his own discomfort in order to continue to take pictures. His occupation as a photographer seems to be a significant element of both Ben's character and the plot of the film itself. Indeed, the role of photography in the movie could suggest further investigations in the storyline such as revealing certain truths or discovering hidden elements related to the tragic event they experienced on their way to their honeymoon cabin. Therefore, understanding Ben's profession could uncover some layers of the movie's narrative and provide insights on the potential sequence of events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The Battle of Naseby took place in the English county of Northamptonshire. This critical battle occurred during the English Civil War, a series of armed conflicts and political disputes between the Royalists, who supported King Charles I, and the Parliamentarians, who were led by Oliver Cromwell. The Battle of Naseby occurred on June 14, 1645, and was the first significant encounter between the Royalists and the newly-formed Parliamentarian army, known as the New Model Army. The location of the battle was near the small village of Naseby, which is situated in the present-day local government district of Daventry, in the county of Northamptonshire. The area consists primarily of open farmland and rolling hills, which made it a suitable battleground for that era's military tactics. Both the Royalist and the Parliamentarian armies were approaching from different directions to converge near Naseby. The Royalists, under King Charles I and Prince Rupert, were advancing from the north and west, while the Parliamentarian forces, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, were moving from the southeast. The battle commenced in the morning of June 14th, with skirmishes occurring between detachments of cavalry from both sides. As the day progressed, the Royalists attacked the Parliamentarians in their carefully chosen positions. Initially, it seemed as though the Royalists would emerge victorious from these engagements, but the tide changed dramatically when the Parliamentarian forces launched a counter-attack. Leading the way was Oliver Cromwell and his \\"Ironsides,\\" a highly trained and disciplined group of cavalrymen, who were instrumental in turning the tide of the battle. Their charge ultimately shattered the Royalist infantry and forced the King's troops to retreat. The Parliamentarian forces pursued the enemy, capturing many prisoners and seizing a significant amount of supplies and ammunition. The outcome was a decisive victory for the Parliamentarians and dealt a critical blow to the Royalist cause. The Battle of Naseby is considered one of the most important engagements in the English Civil War, as it significantly altered the trajectory of the conflict. It highlighted the effectiveness of the New Model Army and its leadership, bolstering the Parliamentarian cause. The victory also weakened King Charles I's authority, leading to his eventual execution and the eventual establishment of a republic in England under Oliver Cromwell. In summary, the Battle of Naseby took place in the county of Northamptonshire, England, on June 14, 1645. The engagement was a crucial turning point in the English Civil War, securing a major victory for the Parliamentarians against the Royalists and demonstrating the effectiveness of the newly-formed New Model Army. This battle largely determined the outcome of the war, leading to the eventual fall of the monarchy and the rise of the English republic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm going out for bird provisions","output":"To describe the sentiment of the given tweet, we must first break down the statement into its various components and analyze each of them to fully understand the emotions and attitudes behind the message. The sentiment in this tweet can be understood through the following analysis: 1. \\"Trouble is, I may have been sucked into Twitter.\\": This part of the statement presents a somewhat negative sentiment. The use of the word \\"trouble\\" signifies that the user is experiencing a conflict or issue. Additionally, the phrase \\"sucked into Twitter\\" implies that the user has unintentionally become engrossed or absorbed in using the platform, potentially against their better judgment. 2. \\"I still think it's stupid though.\\": This statement also portrays a clearly negative sentiment. The user explicitly mentions that they believe Twitter is \\"stupid,\\" implying that they have a low opinion of the platform and its value. This negative viewpoint may be tied to their earlier mention of being \\"sucked into\\" the platform, with the user disliking their involvement in something they deem unworthy or nonsensical. 3. \\"I'm going out for bird provisions\\": The sentiment in this part of the statement is neutral, perhaps even slightly positive. By announcing their intention to leave for \\"bird provisions,\\" the user is signaling that they are stepping away from the online world of Twitter and engaging in a real-life activity - potentially something they find more worthwhile or enjoyable. The mention of birds could also be a subtle wordplay on Twitter's bird logo, adding a touch of humor to the message. It shows that, despite negative feelings towards the platform, the user chooses to focus on taking a break and attending to their offline responsibilities. In summary, the overall sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of negative and neutral emotions, with a hint of humor. The user expresses dissatisfaction and disapproval towards Twitter, while also acknowledging their unintended attachment to the platform. At the same time, they decide to step away and engage in an offline activity, incorporating a subtle wordplay on the platform's bird logo. This sentiment analysis captures the complexity and multidimensionality of the emotions and attitudes present in the tweet."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else.

Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two.

Question: What does Terrori tell Pepito to have as his last drink? Movie title: Â¡Vampiros en La Habana! Movie plot: Joseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado. He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious. However, when he spits it out in disgust, Terrori realizes that Pepito's dislike of drinking blood, the fact that he was harmed by a lead bullet earlier (vampires can only be harmed by silver bullets) and that he is completely impervious to sunlight (it instantly kills vampires) means that Pepito has stopped being a vampire. Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans. However, the leader of the European vampires suggests a deal with his counterparts from Chicago, whereby they can encourage vampires to take small amounts of Vampisol in the summer and visit the mobsters' artificial beaches in the winter. Both groups believe that they are going to make a... A:","output":"In the movie \\"¡Vampiros en La Habana!\\", Johnny Terrori tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink.

Translate this to English?","output":"Financial sustainability is important, but we should also take into consideration the necessity of ensuring an adequate income. Financial sustainability is a crucial aspect of managing any business, organization, or even personal finances. It refers to the ability to maintain or improve one's financial situation over time without depleting resources, indebting oneself, or causing any long-term financial distress. This requires adequate financial planning, risk management, and utilizing efficient processes to ensure that monetary resources are allocated in a way that balances immediate needs with long-term goals. At the same time, ensuring an adequate income is an equally critical component for overall financial stability. Without sufficient income, meeting expenses, saving for future endeavors, and maintaining a good quality of life becomes a significantly tougher challenge. Ensuring an adequate income can be achieved through various means, including securing a stable job with fair compensation, pursuing additional education or certification to improve one's earning potential, and investing wisely to generate passive income. Taking both financial sustainability and adequate income into consideration is vital for several reasons: 1. Financial stability: Ensuring a balance between both concepts helps to create a strong foundation for financial stability, as it allows individuals or organizations to meet their current needs without jeopardizing their future financial situation. 2. Long-term planning: Considering both the sustainability of financial resources and the importance of maintaining a steady income allows for more effective long-term planning. This includes setting achievable goals, creating realistic budgets, and identifying potential areas of growth. 3. Risk management: Understanding the relationship between financial sustainability and income is essential for managing risks. This includes developing contingency plans for potential income fluctuations, preparing for unexpected expenses, and setting aside funds for emergencies. 4. Debt management: Achieving financial sustainability and ensuring an adequate income helps in preventing excessive debt accumulation. By successfully managing finances, it is possible to avoid falling into debt traps and ensure that all liabilities are paid off in a timely manner. 5. Quality of life: Ultimately, balancing financial sustainability with the need for an adequate income enables individuals and organizations to maintain a high quality of life, ensuring that financial pressures do not adversely impact well-being. In conclusion, financial sustainability and ensuring adequate income are two interconnected aspects of managing finances effectively. By taking both elements into account, individuals and organizations can strive to achieve a stable, secure, and successful financial future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine. A romance develops that leads to Christabel marrying Curtis and becoming a high society lady. However, it turns out that she is still attracted to Nick, whom she begins seeing on the side. On one occasion, she slips away from a vacation resort, telling Curtis that she is going to see her aunt Clara. Her lie is exposed by Caine, her uncle, who informs Curtis that the aunt had died while Christabel claimed to be visiting her. Curtis reunites with Donna after sending away Christabel with nothing more than a few expensive furs.

Article:","output":"Title: Car Crash Tragedy: Man Pleads Guilty to Causing Death by Dangerous Driving of Two Friends Introduction: A devastating car accident that claimed the lives of two friends has led to the driver pleading guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The incident, which involved the car hitting a tree and flipping onto its roof, has left communities reeling and sparked discussions about road safety. In this article, we will explore the details surrounding the tragic event, its implications, and the importance of driving safely. The Incident: The tragic event unfolded as the three friends were traveling together in their vehicle. The driver, whose identity has been withheld, lost control of his car and collided with a nearby tree, causing the vehicle to flip onto its roof. As a result, two passengers, both close friends of the driver, suffered fatal injuries in the gruesome accident. The Investigation: Following the incident, authorities initiated a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the accident and the level of the driver's culpability. After analyzing evidence and interviewing witnesses, it was concluded that the driver was highly responsible for the outcome of the crash due to reckless and dangerous driving. Consequently, the driver was charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. The Judicial Proceedings: Facing the enormous grief of his actions and the serious legal consequences, the driver ultimately pleaded guilty to both charges. This step is significant, as it not only denotes a clear admission of guilt but also sets the stage for a faster judicial process, saving both the families of the victims and the accused from a lengthy trial. The Aftermath: As the case reaches its conclusion, the local community is still grappling with the loss of two lives in such a tragic manner. The incident has served as a brutal reminder of the importance of responsible driving and the potential consequences of negligence on the roads. Many have called for increased awareness of road safety, better education on risky driving behaviors, and stricter penalties for those who endanger others while behind the wheel. In Conclusion: This heartbreaking incident serves as a stark warning to all drivers about the potential dangers of risky and reckless driving. The driver's guilty plea reminds us that taking responsibility for our actions is vital, not only for seeking justice for those affected but also for learning from our mistakes to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future. As we mourn the loss of two lives to this unfortunate event, we must also work collectively to promote safe driving practices and ensure our roads are safe for all who use them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin?

The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums chart, and spent 58 weeks in the top 50. It peaked at No. 11 during its 18-week stay on the New Zealand albums chart.Tea & Sympathy comprised songs Fanning had written in his time with Powderfinger, as well as new content written after the band went on hiatus. Most of the writing was done in what Fanning described as a \\"creative burst\\" between March and May 2005. Much of the inspiration for the work on the album came from Fanning's reaction to the death of his brother in 2002, and to the ending of a 12-year relationship with his girlfriend, Philippa Sison. The majority of the album was recorded at Real World Studios with Tchad Blake in June 2005, except for \\"Not Finished Just Yet\\", \\"Believe\\", \\"Wash Me Clean\\", and \\"Hope & Validation\\", which were recorded at Fanning's Brisbane home. Fanning was supported by musicians Jerry Marotta, Keith Duffy, and John Bedggood, who also formed part of his live band. The album was developed in a relaxed manner, with Fanning stating, \\"We had a ball putting the songs together.\\"Three singles were released from the album. The most successful of these was the lead single, \\"Wish You Well\\", shortly followed by \\"Songbird\\". These releases were only sold as digital download singles. The third single from the album, \\"Watch Over Me\\", was the only to be released as a CD single and achieved minor success on the Australian singles chart. It entered the chart on 9 July 2006 at No. 16, and spent eight weeks in the top 50. On 26 January 2006, \\"Wish You Well\\" was voted No. 1 for the Triple J Hottest 100, 2005. Following \\"Watch Over Me\\", Fanning digitally released a fourth single \\"Weekend of Mystery\\", which was not officially on the album, except for those who purchased the album from the iTunes Store. Fanning also took home the award for Best Music Video at the 2006 ARIA Awards for the iconic 'Wish You Well' clip.On 2 December 2005, Fanning announced a nationwide Which Way Home Concert Tour, named after the song on the album of the same name. Fanning played seven shows between 25 February and 10 March 2006, in all of Australia's major capital cities. He was supported by Perth band The Panics and Brisbane singer Andrew Morris. He followed this with the \\"Yesterday's Gone\\" tour, announced on 11 August 2006, and concluding with Powderfinger re-uniting and returning to the recording studio— Fanning later stated that while he enjoyed making Tea & Sympathy, \\"Powderfinger is my real job\\".

After the sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment, over time, the increased pressure and temperature cause the sediments to undergo a process called lithification. This process involves the compaction and cementation of the sediments, turning them into solid sedimentary rock.

Options: - office - bar - barn - industrial area - museum  The answer is \\"barn\\" because","output":"The answer is \\"barn\\" because a milking machine is a piece of equipment used predominantly in the dairy farming industry for the extraction of milk from cows or other dairy animals like goats and sheep. A barn, which is a large structure typically found on farms, is the most suitable location to house and operate milking machines. It provides a safe, clean, and organized environment for the collection of milk. In contrast, the other options are not suitable for the purpose of milking animals. An office is a space used for conducting business, while a bar is a public establishment that serves beverages and is meant for leisure. Neither of these places would be appropriate for dairy farming activities. An industrial area has more to do with large-scale manufacturing and commercial activities rather than agricultural pursuits. Lastly, a museum is a space reserved for the preservation and exhibition of historical and cultural artifacts, which would not typically involve the daily operation of milking machines. That being said, it is important to note that depending on the context, it is theoretically possible to find a milking machine in some of these other settings (e.g., an agricultural museum that showcases historical milking machines). However, the most common and practical location for a milking machine in use would be a barn on a dairy farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night. 1. Who arrives at Thornfield? 2.

Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829).

Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not.

Write highlights for this article: Britain should have no fear of quitting the European Union, which could ‘open up opportunities’ for the country, a senior Tory minister says today. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. ‘I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all,’ he told the Daily Mail in a wide-ranging interview. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, increasingly tipped as a future party leader, said he was not concerned about Britain’s prospects outside the EU if people voted to leave in a referendum. He said it could 'open opportunities' The Tories’ pledge to give people their first say on Britain’s place in Europe for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop European human rights judges interfering in British law – will be centrepieces of the party’s pitch at next year’s general election. The Prime Minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial European Court of Human Rights in the UK at the final Conservative Party conference before the election, which starts this weekend in Birmingham. He is expected to pledge to scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Mr Cameron will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for Britain’s Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to over-ride Strasbourg rulings, according to sources. Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by the end of 2017. ‘We have reason to be confident,’ he said. ‘Look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the EU bailout fund, reducing the budget of the EU, vetoing a treaty.’ But the Culture Secretary went further than Mr Cameron on the possibility of an exit, insisting Britain could prosper outside the EU. ‘If you said to me: “Are you worried or frightened or concerned that the British people might vote to leave?”, that doesn’t frighten me,’ Mr Javid said. The Culture Secretary backed Prime Minister David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with Brussels before holding a referendum by 2017. ‘We should have a referendum on in/out, and if the British people decide Britain is better off outside, I would respect that decision. I think it would open up opportunities. I am not afraid of that at all.’ The European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in British law by the Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with most Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist Britain must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections. The ECHR has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation, who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered, including the right to a family life. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that much anti-European sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects, though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with Brussels. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet reshuffle this summer. ‘This issue is now going to be dealt with,’ said one government source. Tory strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing Ukip.","output":"A senior Tory minister, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, believes that Britain should not be afraid of leaving the European Union.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Bring a notebook and pen to the speech, so you can make note of areas that need improvement. Writing down a shorthand account of what the speaker said will help you to organize the points when it’s time to deliver your critique. Being as detailed as possible in your notes will help the speaker understand exactly what to work on for next time.  If there are no restrictions against it and you have time, record the speech using either a video camera or a tape recorder. This way, you will have the opportunity to play back the speech more than once to get an idea of what point the speaker was making, as well as how well they said it.  Organize your notes so there’s a section on content and a section on delivery. Include examples to back up your evaluation of each. Deconstruct the speech by part, starting with the introduction and ending with the conclusion. Give an overall evaluation of whether you felt the main points of the speech were adequately presented and reinforced, and whether you felt the speech as a whole seemed convincing and credible. Would you consider it a successful speech, or does it need to be revised?  Tell the speaker what elements of the speech were interesting, which parts were confusing, and which areas need more references to back them up. If there were certain jokes or anecdotes that didn’t work, let the speaker know. It’s better to be honest now than to let the person tell the same bad joke twice. Tell the speaker whether you felt the speech was appropriate for the intended audience. It is in this area that speakers often need the most feedback, since it’s difficult to evaluate your own body language and style. Give the speaker a gentle but honest critique of the effectiveness of his or her body language and delivery, including tone of voice, pacing, eye contact, and posture.  It might be helpful to discuss the concept of  emotional intelligence, or EQ, which refers to the ability to read an audience and keep people engaged by affecting their emotions. The point of making eye contact, speaking clearly and sounding natural is to make the audience feel as though you care about them and you want them to understand where you’re coming from. Helping them feel included will make them more likely to stay engaged. If the speaker seemed nervous, you might suggest that he or she practice techniques that help reduce stage fright, like exercising before the speech, laughing before the speech and practicing in front of a small group of people first. The speaker you’re critiquing likely put some time and effort into writing and practicing the speech. Any time you’re giving a critique, it’s just as important to point out what went right as it is to discuss what needs improvement. If you’re working with a student or someone who needs help improving their speech-giving skills, be encouraging and complimentary so they have the confidence to keep working on their skills.  Try the feedback sandwich technique: give the person a compliment on an element of their speech, tell them what needs improvement, then give them another compliment. This classic way to deliver constructive criticism makes the medicine go down more easily. For example, you could tell the person he or she started with a brilliant hook, but you were confused about how the second point related to the thesis. However, the conclusion clarified the main point.  As a way to encourage the person to keep learning and improving, you might suggest he or she watch videos of speeches given by famous speakers. Point out similarities and differences between the speech you’re critiquing and the famous speech. Summary:","output":"The article provides comprehensive guidance on how to effectively critique a speech, recommending recording the speech for detailed analysis, taking thorough notes on both content and delivery, and dissecting the speech into sections for precise feedback. It emphasizes honest feedback on each aspect, and the importance of informing the speaker about their strengths, parts of the speech that were confusing, and areas that need more substantiation.

Available choices:  + Coat tiles with car wax..  + Coat tiles with candle wax..","output":"To accomplish the goal of easily cleaning grease off backsplash tiles behind a stove, the best available choice between the two provided options would be to coat the tiles with car wax. Here is a detailed reasoning and comparison for both options: Car Wax: 1. Composition: Car wax is a formula specifically designed to protect surfaces from dirt, grease, and other contaminants. It usually contains solvents, polymers, and natural and synthetic waxes that create a protective layer on the surface, making the surface hydrophobic and resistant to dirt. 2. Application: Car wax is easy to apply, typically using a microfiber cloth to spread it onto the surface evenly and allow it to dry. It also requires a simple buffing after drying, which can be quickly accomplished by wiping the surface with a clean cloth. 3. Benefits: Using car wax on the backsplash tiles will create a durable barrier against grease and grime, making it easier to clean off any stains resulting from cooking. The hydrophobic properties will prevent water-based substances from adhering to the surface and protect the tiles from potential damage. 4. Safety: Car wax is appropriate for household use, safe for use on various materials, and does not pose any significant health risks. Candle Wax: 1. Composition: Candle wax is made from a variety of materials, such as paraffin, stearin, beeswax, or soy, primarily designed for candle-making purposes and not suitable for protecting surfaces from dirt or grime without additional processing. 2. Application: Applying candle wax to a surface would require melting the wax, which can be hazardous if not done carefully. Moreover, it is difficult to spread it evenly on a vertical surface, such as backsplash tiles, without the risk of wax drips and an uneven coat. 3. Benefits: Although candle wax may offer temporary protection against grease and dirt, it lacks the durable and robust characteristics of car wax, making it less efficient for this purpose. It may also require frequent reapplication to maintain effectiveness. 4. Safety: Chemical additives found in some candle waxes, such as paraffin, may release harmful fumes when heated, posing potential health risks. Furthermore, the process of melting wax can be dangerous, leading to potential burns or fire hazards, especially in a kitchen environment. In conclusion, car wax emerges as the more reasonable option to protect backsplash tiles from grease and grime. It is specifically designed for protecting surfaces from dirt and contaminants, is easy and safe to apply, and provides a durable solution that would simplify the cleaning process. In comparison, candle wax is not suitable for this purpose due to its inadequate protective properties, complicated application process, and potential safety concerns."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Analyze the given information. 2. Compare it with the question. 3. Research if necessary. 4. Provide the final answer. Step 1: Analyze the given information The information provided tells us about the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offering a one-year patent for new refinements in luxury around 500 BCE. Step 2: Compare it with the question The question asks about the recognition of copyright in Jewish law. The provided information is not about Jewish law or copyright but rather a patent in the Greek state of Sybaris. Step 3: Research if necessary I will conduct quick research to determine when Jewish law recognized copyright. Based on my research, Jewish law does address concepts of intellectual property rights dating back to the Talmud, which discusses the idea of \\"hasagat ge'vul,\\" meaning \\"boundary encroachment.\\" This concept prevents unfair competition and defends intellectual property rights, though it does not directly align with the modern concept of copyright. The recognition of copyright in Jewish law, as we understand it today, comes later during the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) period, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Step 4: Provide the final answer The answer \\"In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\\" is not a good answer to the question \\"When did Jewish law recognize copyright?\\". Instead, you could answer that Jewish law recognized concepts related to intellectual property rights as early as in the Talmud with the \\"hasagat ge'vul\\" concept, while the understanding of copyright in Jewish law as we know it today developed during the Jewish Enlightenment period in the 18th and 19th centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Louis XIV (5 September 16381 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (') or the Sun King ('), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history. In this age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).   - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Prince of Orange is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title \\"Prince of Orange\\" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. The title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. The title descends via absolute primogeniture since 1983, meaning that its holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Treaty of Utrecht, which established the Peace of Utrecht, is a series of individual peace treaties, rather than a single document, signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht in March and April 1713. The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war.  - Prussia was a historic state originating out of the Duchy of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and centred on the region of Prussia. For centuries, the House of ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organised and effective army. Prussia, with its capital in and from 1701 in Berlin, shaped the history of Germany. In 1871, German states united to create the German Empire under Prussian leadership. In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the German Revolution of 191819. The Kingdom of Prussia was thus abolished in favour of a republicthe Free State of Prussia, a state of Germany from 1918 until 1933. From 1933, Prussia lost its independence as a result of the Prussian coup, when the Nazi regime was successfully establishing its ' laws in pursuit of a unitary state. With the end of the Nazi regime, the division of Germany into allied-occupation zones and the separation of its territories east of the line, which were incorporated into Poland and the Soviet Union, the State of Prussia ceased to exist de facto in 1945. Prussia existed \\"\\" until its formal liquidation by the Allied Control Council Enactment No. 46 of 25 February 1947.  - Frederick William I (14 August 1688  31 May 1740), known as the 'Soldier King,' was the King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death, as well as the father of Frederick the Great. He was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel.  - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor.  - Francesco Guerini ( fl . 1740 -- 1770 ) was a Neapolitan violinist and composer whose works were published throughout Europe in the mid 18th century . While his birthdate is unknown , Guerini worked in The Hague for the Prince of Orange from 1740 until 1760 , at which time he moved to London , where he was active until 1770 . Most of Guerini 's published compositions were sonatas for one or two violins and continuo , but he also wrote keyboard works as well as Six Sonates / A deux Flûtes , ou deux Violons ... Ouevre III ( with no continuo ) , Paris , ca . 1750 , or Six Solos for a Violoncello with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord , Opus 9 , first published in London in 1765 .  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831.  - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.  - William III (4 November 1650  8 March 1702; also widely known as William of Orange) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth, Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672, and King of England, Ireland, and Scotland from 1689 until his death. It is a coincidence that his regnal number (III) was the same for both Orange and England. As King of Scotland, he is known as William II. He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as \\"King Billy\\".  - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Frederick I (11 July 1657  25 February 1713), of the Hohenzollern dynasty, was (as Frederick III) Elector of Brandenburg (16881713) and Duke of Prussia in personal union (Brandenburg-Prussia). The latter function he upgraded to royalty, becoming the first King in Prussia (17011713). From 1707 he was in personal union the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel. He was also the paternal grandfather of Frederick the Great.  - The Principality of Orange (in French \\"la Principauté d'Orange\\") was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in Provence, in the south of modern-day France, on the left bank of the river Rhone north of the city of Avignon.   - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.

Embarrassed, he gets back up, picks up his groceries and carries them into his apartment with his head down. After putting his groceries away, he notices that although both of his knees are scraped, only his left knee is warm to the touch. His right knee feels cool when he puts his hand on it.  and a hint : The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  Please answer this question : Is more blood flowing to the right or left knee? Answer:","output":"More blood is flowing to the left knee.  Step 1: Identify the symptoms of both knees.  - Both knees are scraped, but only the left knee is warm to the touch. The right knee feels cool.  Step 2: Refer to the hint for information about the body's response to inflammation. - Inflammation is a response to infections or injuries and causes blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the damaged area, making it red and warm.  Step 3: Compare the symptoms with the information from the hint. - The left knee is warm, indicating increased blood flow due to inflammation as a response to the injury. Step 4: Determine which knee has more blood flow. - Since the left knee is warm and the right knee is cool, it can be concluded that more blood is flowing to the left knee as a result of the body's inflammatory response to the injury."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

UK factories enjoyed a surge in new orders over the summer, but high oil prices weighed on the service sector, surveys suggest.","output":"The situation being discussed here involves the UK's manufacturing and service sectors' performance over the summer period. It highlights the contrasting circumstances faced by these two key areas of the economy. On one hand, UK factories experienced an increase in new orders, contributing positively to the overall production capacity and economic growth. On the other hand, the service sector faced challenges due to high oil prices, which negatively impacted its performance. To provide more context, let's delve into these two aspects individually: 1. Surge in new orders for UK factories: During the summer months, UK manufacturing facilities witnessed a significant increase in new orders. This can be attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, with COVID-19 restrictions easing in the UK and globally, businesses and consumers alike experienced increased confidence in economic stability, leading to higher demand for goods. This, in turn, resulted in new orders for factories to fulfill. Additionally, the Brexit transition period concluded at the end of 2020, and businesses in the UK and EU have been adapting to the new trade arrangements. This could have led to an increased demand for UK-made goods, contributing to the rise in factory orders. Furthermore, various government stimulus programs and support measures for both businesses and individuals were introduced to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. This increased disposable income and encouraged spending, translating into higher demand for consumer goods and, consequently, increased orders for UK factories. 2. High oil prices and the service sector: Conversely, the UK service sector faced headwinds during the same period, primarily due to high oil prices. The price of oil is a critical factor for the service sector because it influences the costs of transportation, energy, and production. When oil prices rise, it often results in increased operating costs for businesses operating in the service industry. Higher oil prices can cause numerous challenges for businesses in the service sector. For instance, transportation costs for goods and people increase, directly affecting the service industry, such as logistics, courier services, and public transportation. In addition, businesses that rely on energy-intensive processes or equipment may need to pay higher energy costs, subsequently influencing their overall expenses and profit margins. Moreover, higher fuel prices can also contribute to inflation, leading to increased costs of living and curbed consumer spending, which negatively affects service providers reliant on consumer spending. In conclusion, the summer months brought mixed fortunes for the UK's manufacturing and service sectors. While factories enjoyed a surge in new orders due to increased demand, eased COVID-19 restrictions, government stimulus programs, and businesses adapting to post-Brexit trade, the service sector faced challenges due to the rising oil prices that added pressure on operating costs, and potentially suppressed consumer spending. These contrasting situations demonstrate the complexities and interconnectedness of different parts of the economy and the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to foster sustainable growth and development across all sectors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Kai turned their lights away from the house because they didn't want to wake anyone inside.  Given the context: What does Kai need to do before this?  Possible answers: have their lights on, have their lights broken, drive in front of the park A:","output":"In the given context, prior to turning their lights away from the house, Kai would need to have their lights on. This action suggests that they are most likely in a vehicle, and the presence of functional lights is necessary for them to illuminate the house in the first place. Having their lights on indicates that Kai is using their headlights or some other source of light that is attached to their vehicle. These lights would be shining towards the house, causing potential disturbance to the people inside. Kai's decision to turn the lights away from the house is likely out of courtesy, aiming to prevent unwanted light from entering the rooms of the residents who may be sleeping or need a dark environment. Having their lights broken would not be a factor in this situation, as Kai would not be able to light up the house with broken lights. Additionally, driving in front of the park does not seem directly related to the given context since it's not an activity Kai must do before turning their lights away from the house. In summary, the most appropriate and logical answer is that Kai needs to have their lights on before turning them away from the house in order to avoid disturbing anyone inside."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Taro is a river located in northern Italy, specifically in the Emilia-Romagna region. 2. It is a tributary of the Po river and has a length of 126 km. 3. The Taro flows almost entirely in the province of Parma, which is west of the city of Parma. 4. The river eventually flows into the Po near Gramignazzo, which is a part of the comune of Sissa, located in the province of Parma. Given the information in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"The Taro flows only in the province of Parma\\" is entirely true. The key phrase in the paragraph is that the Taro flows \\"almost entirely\\" in the province of Parma. This suggests that there may be a small portion of the river that flows outside of the province. It would be more accurate to say that the Taro flows predominantly in the province of Parma."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: I remember Casper comic books, but don't remember any cartoons. Maybe they weren't memorable; I don't know but at my advanced age, here I am watching this very early Casper animated short yesterday. Afterward, I was shocked to read the user-comments here. Did people miss the ending? I have to learn all over again that Casper isn't like the other ghosts, who like to go out each night and scare the c--p out of everyone. \\"He sees no future in that,\\" according to the narrator here. Instead, one night he goes out to the rural section of town, inadvertently scares some animals and can't find any friends. It brings him to tears, until a little fox hears him bawling and befriends him. The two become buddies but soon, the fox is running for his life with a fox hunt in progress. Other reviews have all mentioned what happens, so I'll touch on that, too. The fox is killed by hunting dogs (not shown) and Casper is in tears for losing \\"the only friend I ever had.\\" But, nobody mentions the happy ending to this story. \\"Ferdie\\" the fox becomes a spirit-figure like Casper, jumps on his lap, licks his face and the narrator comments \\"they lived happily ever after.\\" Both characters look overjoyed.

At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned?\\"  Context: \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned is known as \\"Reproof.\\" This is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin.

Please answer a question about the following article about Chihuahua (state): The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855. The state was able to survive through the Reform War with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures. The 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative Zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of Chihuahua and Parral. In August 1859, Zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal Orozco and his forces; Orozco soon after deposed the state governor, but had to flee to Durango two months later. In the late 1860s the conservative General Cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of Jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders Jesús González Ortega and José María Patoni. Cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in La Batalla del Gallo. Cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state, but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state. The successful liberal leaders José María Patoni of Durango and J.E. Muñoz of Chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree.

This necessity could be due to various factors like the nature of the terrain, environmental protection rules, accessibility issues, etc. Therefore, it could be judged that the premise consists of two distinct groups of points according to their accessibility: 1. Points that can be reached by driving 2. Points that necessitate walking So, when the hypothesis suggests that \\"You can drive to all of them,\\" it contradicts the information provided in the premise, as the premise clearly states not all points allow or can be reached by driving. Thus, this generalization is not valid based upon the given premise.  To align with the premise, the hypothesis could be modified to a conditional statement such as, \\"You can drive to some of them, and will have to walk to reach others.\\" This would reflect the description and conditions given in the initial premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the Middle Ages was the romance, an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the novel, of which early and important examples are the Chinese Monkey and the German Faust books. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What genre was the most characteristic form of the Bronze Ages?","output":"To answer this question, I will perform some research on the literature and writing forms of the Bronze Age. Step 1: Research the time period and literature of the Bronze Age. - The Bronze Age was a historical period characterized by the use of bronze, the early development of urban civilization, and often marked by advancements in areas such as writing, architecture, and art. This period occurred between approximately 3300 and 1200 BCE. - The ancient civilizations known for their Bronze Age accomplishments include the Sumerians, the Ancient Egyptians, the Minoans, the Mycenaeans, and the Hittites among others. Step 2: Identify prominent literary forms and genres of the Bronze Age. - The earliest forms of writing appeared during the Bronze Age. This included the development of cuneiform by the Sumerians and hieroglyphics by the Egyptians. - Literature in the Bronze Age was primarily focused on religious texts, laws, accounts, and poetry. - Some examples of Bronze Age literature include the Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, the Instructions of Shuruppak, and the Hittite Code of the Nesilim. Based on the available information, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific genre as the most characteristic form of the Bronze Age, as the various genres and texts produced during this time were primarily religious or legal in nature, and storytelling or narrative genres, like romance or novel, were not as developed or prominent during this time period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two neighboring farms both had depleted soils due to intensive agricultural practices for decades.

Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:","output":"Pear farm used fewer cover crops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the inspectors to leave the country. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, along with a \\"coalition of the willing\\" that consisted of additional troops from the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, from Australia and Poland. Within about three weeks, the invasion caused the collapse of both the Iraqi government and its armed forces, however, the U.S. and allied forces failed to find any weapon of mass destruction in Iraq. Traces of former materials and weapons labs were reported to have been located, but no \\"smoking guns\\". Nevertheless, on May 1, George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of \\"major combat operations\\" in the Iraq War. Bush's approval rating in May was at 66%, according to a CNN–USA Today–Gallup poll. However, Bush's high approval ratings did not last. First, while the war itself was popular in the U.S., the reconstruction and attempted \\"democratization\\" of Iraq lost some support as months passed and casualty figures increased, with no decrease in violence nor progress toward stability or reconstruction. Second, as investigators combed through the country, they failed to find the predicted WMD stockpiles, which led to debate over the rationale for the war.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the genre that AllMusic defines as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\" and is used in the fourth and final studio album by The Axis of Perdition? A:","output":"The genre that AllMusic defines as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\" is known as Industrial Metal. Industrial Metal is a diverse and innovative musical style that combines the hard-hitting and powerful elements of heavy metal with the futuristic and experimental sounds of industrial music. The roots of Industrial Metal can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when rock bands and electronic artists began experimenting with new ways to combine their sounds. With the advent of digital sampling technology, musicians and producers were able to integrate synthesized sounds, digital effects, and distorted recordings into their compositions. This resulted in dense, abrasive, and aggressive soundscapes that pushed the boundaries of contemporary music. As a genre, Industrial Metal typically features aggressive guitar riffs, powerful drumming, and commanding vocals. These elements are often enhanced with electronic elements such as synthesizers, drum machines, and looping equipment. Lyrically, Industrial Metal often explores themes of dystopia, oppression, societal decay, and individual freedom, reflecting the heavy and brutal nature of its sound. The Axis of Perdition, a UK-based experimental extreme metal band, has released four studio albums throughout their career. Their fourth and final studio album, \\"Tenements (Of The Anointed Flesh),\\" released in 2011, prominently features the Industrial Metal genre. This album showcases the band's penchant for combining the aggressive and dark aspects of black metal, death metal, and grindcore, with the ambient and experimental qualities often found in industrial music. The end result is a sonic journey that explores the depths of darkness, despair, and sonic chaos - a fitting representation of the abrasive and aggressive nature of Industrial Metal. The inclusion of Industrial Metal on the Axis of Perdition's final studio album further solidifies the importance of this genre within the world of extreme music. With its innovative fusion of rock and electronic music, Industrial Metal has left a significant impact on various subgenres and continues to challenge the limits of musical expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 21:02 EST, 24 February 2013. |. UPDATED:. 05:27 EST, 25 February 2013. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, whose fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, has been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry truck. Officials now say there is no evidence the world's most powerful drug baron Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was killed in a February 21 shootout in the Guatemalan jungle. Earlier reports claimed 'El Chapo' died in a hail of bullets February 21 in a jungle shootout with a rival gang near the Mexican border. Last week, villagers in the Peten province near the border with Mexico, claimed they spotted a blood-soaked body that resembled the fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader slumped in a car after after a clash between two heavily-armed drugs gangs. Guatemalan Interior Minister Mauricio Lopez Bonilla now calls the reports a misunderstanding. After police and soldiers assessed the area of the shootout, no evidence the kingpin was even there was found. He called the confusion a result of mistaken eyewitness accounts and apologized for the earlier reports. 'I apologize if where was a misunderstanding. It was a mix-up,' Bonilla told Guatemalan radio station Emisores Unidos. 'We were referring to information generated from the area that there was possibly a crime scene with a dead person resembling El Chapo.' 'As of now, we have no verification,' he said. Misunderstanding? Villagers in the Peten province of Guatemala near the border with Mexico claimed they found a body resembling El Chapo but officials have now called it all a 'misunderstanding' Public Enemy Number One: Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's Public Enemy Number One, a year after the US Treasury Department named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. He is the top dog in Mexico's bloody drug war, presiding over a 1 billion drug empire and accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed 38,000 people. And in 2011, aside from a personal fortune to rival Bill Gates and Warren. Buffet, Joaquin Guzman Loera was officially named as the. world's most wanted man. Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex break out that reportedly cost him £2.5million. Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' - meaning 'Shorty' - because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drug cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the United States. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen. assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a. bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of. non-aggression that had previously existed. As tit for tat. fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in. 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has so far claimed. 38,000 lives. Now. El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's. government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his. country amid claims that such drug lords are. really the ones in charge. Government spokesman Francisco Cuevas. first told Guatevision Television that two drug gangs had clashed in. Peten, an area that has seen an increase in drug violence and that at. least two men had died in the shootout. Later, Cuevas told Mexico's Televisa. network that authorities hadn't yet found a body or the scene where. reports said a shootout took place. He never said what led officials to think that one of the dead men might be Guzman. But Interior Department spokeswoman. Carla Herrera told The Associated Press that one of the victims. physically resembled the drug lord. She said officials had asked the. Mexican government to send Guzman's fingerprints to compare them to the. man found inside a vehicle and to send investigators. Even then, Bonilla told the AP that it was residents of the town of San Francisco who had told officials of a gun battle and reported that one of the people killed looked like Guzman. Peten province is an isolated area of jungle and ranches where 27 ranch workers were massacred in 2011 by the Zetas drug gang, a top rival for Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel. Guzman, who has been in hiding since escaping from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001, is one of the world's most dangerous and most wanted fugitives. El Chapo's, fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion, and he's been on the run since 2001 when he escaped from a Mexican. prison in a laundry truck. There has been a 7million bounty on his head ever since. Last year, the US Treasury Department. named the kingpin as the 'world's most influential drugs trafficker' before. Chicago's crime commission this month officially recognized him as the city's. Public Enemy Number One - the first time the infamous soubriquet has. been rolled out since Al Capone in the 1920s. Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel. has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building. international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific. And earlier this month, Guzman formally received the title of Chicago's Public Enemy No. in both the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's first use since Prohibition. The. Public Enemy No. 1 label was created for mobster Al Capone. But the DEA. said Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman is more menacing than the Chicago. gangster was.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not for vote for in either of his presidential runs?  Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President). The state's U.S. Senate seats... Answer:","output":"The name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for in either of his presidential runs is Ronald Reagan. Minnesota has consistently cast its Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, and it is the only state that did not vote for Reagan in both the 1980 and 1984 elections.

The young man used the motorcycle to get to work instead of the bicycle because the","output":"day was exceptionally hot and humid, and he didn't want to arrive at work drenched in sweat. As his motorcycle rumbled to life, he decided to take a longer, more scenic route that would weave through the outskirts of the city and offer him the cool breeze that would make the unbearable heat more tolerable. He knew it would add to his commute time, but he didn't mind. After all, he had always been one to appreciate the beauty of nature and the environment around him. The sun had just begun to rise, casting a golden hue on the sky and illuminating the tiny specks of dew that clung to the leaves. The young man rode his motorcycle across the empty roads, the warm air buffeting against his body as he carved through the city’s early morning stillness. He enjoyed the feeling of freedom the motorcycle gave him, something he found to be lacking in the confined spaces of public transit or in the slow crawl of a bicycle journey. His route took him past a serene lake, its waters reflecting the sky like a mirror. The sight was so enchanting he couldn’t help but pull over to admire it, and as he sat on the edge of the shore, he noticed small ripples in the water as if invisible creatures were dancing beneath the surface. Some distance away, a group of ducks floated gracefully, their synchronized movements a charming spectacle. The young man made a mental note to pack a sketchpad and some pencils the next time he stopped here, wanting to capture the scene that had mesmerized him so. He spent a few minutes basking in the peaceful atmosphere, allowing the subtle sounds around him to wash over his senses – the distant hum of a car, the gentle rustling of leaves, the melodious chirping of birds. Finally, feeling rejuvenated, he continued his ride through the winding roads, noticing the subtle changes in the flora and fauna as he went. Wildflowers lined the edge of the roads, their vibrant colors sprinkling the landscape with subtle beauty. He marveled at the way the morning light, now stronger, filtered through the trees and dappled the earth with a kaleidoscope of hues. He sighed with contentment, knowing that despite the extra time this route had added to his journey, it had also filled him with a resplendent joy that made the daily grind of work more bearable. The young man zipped past farmhouses, their grazing cows lazily eyeing the stranger as he whizzed by. As he entered the city's limits, he noticed the landscape becoming more urban and uniform. All around him were concrete structures rising into the sky, perhaps once magnificent but now eroding under the unyielding pressure of time. The city bustled with people heading to work, and the hum of machinery echoed louder as the day awoke. The young man arrived at work just in time, savoring the memory of the morning's adventure as he carefully parked his motorcycle and donned his familiar work attire. Navigating through the office, he greeted his colleagues with a warm smile and an undeniable energy that could only have come from starting his day with such a splendid detour. As he began his workday, he couldn't help but feel that he had discovered a ritual that would forever change his mornings. It was a simple act, choosing a different mode of transportation and taking a longer route to work, but in its simplicity lay a profound joy – a connection to the world around him and a constant reminder that there was beauty to be found amidst the demands of everyday life. And so, from that day onward, the young man would find solace and happiness in his scenic commute, making his days just a little more magical."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: This technique works great with rough or reclaimed wood. The finished product will look rustic, and will look like the wood of a barn.  Because this technique is designed to create a rustic look, you almost never have to sand. The roughness of the wood actually adds to the final, barn-like, product. The wood does not need to be perfectly clean, but if it’s very dirty, wash it with soapy water. Let it dry completely before you begin painting. It is best to pour the paint on the center of the wood. Start with a small amount, and add more if necessary.  You can use any type of paint with this technique, although most people find latex paint the easiest to work with. Add water if the paint is too thick. Adding water will also make it easier to drag the paint across the wood. Spread the paint across the wood, into the grain, and let it soak into the grooves. If you want a light coat of paint, you can spread the paint out thinly. For more coverage, don’t spread the paint as widely. Repeat this step to fill in blank areas. Let the piece sit overnight, and then check it. The paint may take longer to dry in areas where you applied thick layers of paint. Make sure it is completely dry, and not tacky to the touch, before you move the wood. If you want the wood to have more coverage, or a brighter finish, add more paint and scrape it across the wood. Add as many layers as you like, but remember that the more paint you apply, the less the wood will show through. Summary:","output":"The article discusses a technique for giving wood a rustic, barn-like appearance without the need for sanding. Ideal for rough or reclaimed wood, this method involves applying paint, preferably latex, directly onto the wood's surface and allowing it to soak into the grooves and grain. The wood should be reasonably clean, but not necessarily spotless. Paint can be thinned with water to facilitate easy spreading, and the amount of coverage can be adjusted according to preference. Once painted, the wood should be left to dry overnight, with additional layers of paint added if desired. However, remember that applying more paint will decrease the visibility of the wood's natural texture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pick from: (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","output":"(b). it is not possible to tell; Explanation: Given the premise that \\"a white van with graffiti is driving in front of a market,\\" we are provided with a few pieces of information regarding the scenario. However, the hypothesis suggests that \\"a graffiti-covered van is taking children to the market.\\" It's important to analyze these statements and determine if the premise's truth makes the hypothesis true, and in this case, the answer is that it is not possible to tell. First, let's consider what the premise tells us: 1. There is a white van. 2. The van has graffiti on it. 3. The van is driving in front of a market. Now looking at the hypothesis, we can point out the following additional pieces of information: 1. The van is carrying children. 2. The purpose of the van being there is to take the children to the market. None of the above information provided in the hypothesis is implied or directly stated in the premise. Although the premise informs us about the existence and location of the white van with graffiti, it does not provide any details on the passengers of the van (if there are any) or the reasons behind the van's action. In other words, the premise doesn't reveal why the van is there and the intentions of its occupants, especially if there are children involved. It is important to note that although the hypothesis could be true, given that the premise is true, we cannot definitively confirm or deny this scenario solely based on the information provided in the premise. There could be many reasons the van is driving in front of the market – perhaps it is making a delivery or simply passing through. It could be taking children to the market or not, but based solely on the premise at hand, we cannot determine if our assumptions are accurate and conclusive. So, to answer the question, given that the premise is true, we cannot conclusively determine if the hypothesis is true as well. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in this case would be (b) - it is not possible to tell."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

The real life sorrow of a J-pop fantasy reaches millions. A Japanese pop starlet recorded a tearful video and shaved her head, a traditional gesture of contrition, to apologize for breaking her band's cardinal rule: no dating. \\"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band. Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry,\\" said Minami Minegishi, 20, during the nearly four minute video that has been seen nearly 6.9 million times. Her phenomenally successful band AKB48 consists of about 90 girls from their mid-teens to early 20s, who are strongly marketed on their sex appeal. The band's management forbids the members from dating boys for fear that it might shatter the illusion that their male fans might end up with them one day, reports the Agence France-Presse. RELATED: JAPAN’S AKB48, CHOSEN BY FANS, SET TO GO GLOBAL The Japanese tabloid Shukan Bunshun published photographs of Minegishi, one of AKB48's founding members, leaving boy band dancer Alan Shirahama's apartment Thursday. The magazine claimed they had a passionate night together. Within hours, Minegishi shaved off her long hair and called her actions \\"thoughtless and immature\\" as she begged for forgiveness from fans on the band's official YouTube channel. \\"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48,\\" said Minegishi.

I read this background article the other day: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  I am facing a new situation today: Bubba and Dean are two farmers which realized the benefits of having AM fungi in their soil. Dean, however, took active steps in helping the growth of AM fungi so he grew cover crops on his lands.

Input: What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Hillary Clinton ? The Justice Department is reviving investigations involving Hillary Clintonâs emails and the degree to which the State Department during Mrs. Clintonâs tenure as secretary was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation. Good. Indeed  it is long overdue. It underscores a point weâve tried to make repeatedly here: You donât need a special counsel for this kind of thing; such investigations are what we have a Justice Department full of career prosecutors for. The perverse institution of the independent prosecutor should be shunned whenever possible â and its jurisdiction tightly confined in the rare necessary case. Obamaâs first point led to one of the great head-fakes in modern law-enforcement history â one that reverberates to this day. Using his bully pulpit  the president framed the  Clinton  case as one of negligence. The portrayal stuck: Incessantly  the Justice Department  the media  and eventually James Comey  then-director of the FBI  addressed the case in terms of Mrs. Clintonâs purported carelessness â a hardworking public officialâs regrettable but forgivable inattention to detail. Even now  critics of  Clinton  and the FBI are in a lather over reports that  as Comeyâs team drafted his remarks exonerating  Clinton  (notwithstanding that key witnesses  including  Clinton   herself   had not been interviewed)  agent Peter Strzok changed the term âgrossly negligentâ to âextremely careless.â Substantively  these terms are indistinguishable. The emendation is said to be critical  though  because the statute applicable to  Clinton âs conduct criminalizes âgross negligence.â If Comey had said the words âgrossly negligent â so the story goes  it would be the equivalent of pronouncing  Clinton  guilty. This was a straightforward case of criminal intent. Negligence was the fallback position â for a prosecutor  an âeven ifâ theory  as in: âEven if youâre not convinced by our overwhelming evidence of  Clinton âs willfully illegal retention and transmission of classified information  you can still comfortably find  her  guilty if you conclude that  she  was grossly negligent â which  as the judge will tell you in his instructions  simply means âextremely careless.ââ Mrs. Clintonâs criminal intent was so clear that its obfuscation also required Obamaâs second point: Mrs. Clintonâs lack of intent to imperil the United States. Director Comey hammered his bossâs legerdemain again and again. And why not? After all  it was true  â Clinton  unquestionably had no desire to endanger our country. Itâs always good to go with the truth . . . especially if you have the luxury of a Democrat-smitten media that wonât ask whether the truth youâve highlighted is relevant to the matter under investigation. Second  you may be saying to yourself: âBut âintent to harm the United Statesâ is significant  so it should be part of a classified-information offense.â Thatâs right  and thatâs why it is a part of a classified-information offense â it just happens not to be the offense weâre talking about in Mrs.  Clinton âs case. If an official illegally transmits classified information âwith an intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States â then that official commits the more serious felony offense prescribed at the top of the Espionage Actâs scale â subsection (a). If someone had suggested charging  Mrs. Clinton  with this treasonous offense  then  she   President Obama  and Director Comey would have been quite right to stress that  she  had no such intent. But no one suggested that. Rather  it was urged that  she  had transmitted classified information on purpose  but not with intent to do the country harm. That is less heinous than the treasonous offense. But it is still egregious. It is a crime that puts the lives of intelligence sources and the effectiveness of life-saving intelligence operations at risk. That  Clinton  did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make  her  innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places. Moreover  it is a black-letter principle that a personâs innocence of Crime A is inadmissible to prove that the person has not committed Crime B. For example  the fact that I have not personally sold drugs has no bearing on whether I laundered drug money. And the fact that  Mrs. Clinton  did not intend that any harm come to the United States does not make  her  innocent of willfully transmitting classified information to unauthorized persons or places  or of retaining it when  she  left the government and when the State Department finally requested that  she  surrender the government records in  her  possession. Regardless of whether my motive theory is sound  however  the evidence that  Clinton  willfully mishandled classified information is mountainous. Before she was ever secretary of state   Clinton  lived and worked in a White House where classified-information protocols were observed.  She  had to apply these protocols for years as a senator whose committee assignments were intelligence-intensive. Before becoming secretary of state   she  was indoctrinated in the handling of classified information and signed documentation attesting that  she  had read and understood the relevant executive orders about intelligence classification and handling.  Clinton  well understood that the position of secretary of state involved immersion in classified information.  She  wrote in  her  memoir about the extraordinary steps  she  was required to take to safeguard classified information. Given the nature of  her  responsibilities for foreign relations and national security   her  decision to conduct all  her  government business on a private server system made it inevitable that classified information would be transmitted in and stored on the private system. There is no possibility that  she  did not know this. The private system  she  set up was in violation of government and State Department regulations.  Her  loyal staff fought efforts to bring  her  into the government email system â even though  she  forced the resignation of an ambassador over  among other things  his conducting of government business over an unauthorized private email system. When the request was made that  Clinton  surrender  her  emails to the State Department   she  turned them over to  her  own lawyers and subordinates who did not have the security clearances required for access to the information.  She  destroyed tens of thousands of emails  even though they were under subpoena  so that they could not be reviewed by the State Department or the FBI. Of the 30 000  she  deigned to surrender to the State Department  over 2 000 contained classified information  some of it among the nationâs most highly classified national-defense secrets. And  she  serially lied in  her  public statements about  her  emails  in congressional testimony (in which  she  brazenly claimed to have turned over all work-related email to the State Department  and that  her  lawyers had carefully reviewed every email before designating which should be surrendered and which withheld)  and in  her  FBI interview (in which  she  pretended not to know what the ubiquitous â[C]â designation â for confidential â in classified documents meant). Any prosecutor who understood there was no need to prove intent to harm the United States would be delighted to take that case to the jury â especially once the prosecutor realized heâd get to tell the jury: âEven if you suspend disbelief and buy the defense argument that  she  didnât mean to horde and transmit classified information  you must still find  her  guilty if you conclude  she  was grossly negligent â as in âextremely carelessâ.â Output:","output":"Negative"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Craig wanted to get acupuncture but William thought it was foolish.","output":"Once upon a time, there lived two friends named Craig and William. Craig heard about something called acupuncture, which is when you use tiny, special needles and gently poke them into your skin. It may sound scary, but some people believe it can help them feel better. One day, Craig decided he wanted to try acupuncture. He thought that it could help with his sore muscles, like when a magical fairy helps to heal the injuries of a knight after a battle. But, his friend William thought this idea was very foolish. William was like the worried sidekick who doesn't believe in the magic gem's powers. Instead, William thought there were other ways to feel better, like visiting the wise healer in the village, which meant seeing a doctor, or doing some gentle exercises. Craig listened to William but still wanted to give acupuncture a try. He believed that it could be like a special healing spell that might work for him. So, Craig went to a professional acupuncturist to let them use their tiny magic wands (needles) to poke him very gently. While Craig was trying acupuncture, William went on his own journey to learn more about this strange treatment. He asked people in the kingdom and even read some scrolls (books) about how it worked. William started to understand that different people might need different forms of healing, just like how different animals need different types of food. After a few acupuncture sessions, Craig found that his sore muscles started to feel better. He was happy that he listened to his heart and tried this new method. Meanwhile, William learned that sometimes it's good to be open to new ideas, even if they might sound strange or magical at first. In the end, their friendship became even stronger, as they continued on many more exciting adventures together, while always trying to learn and help each other along the way. And so, Craig and William lived happily ever after, enjoying the magic of friendship and the wisdom of trying new things."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

According to the Chinese zodiac, Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon, which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen. Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old. Bruce's father, Lee Hoi-chuen, (Li Hai Quan ) was Han Chinese, and his mother, Grace Ho (He Ai Yu ), was of Eurasian ancestry. After attending Tak Sun School (De Xin Xue Xiao ) (several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon), Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at the age of 12. In 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College (high school), where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team. In 1958 Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous champion in the final.  In the spring of 1959, Lee got into another street fight and the police were called. Until his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family. Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States. His parents confirmed the police's fear that this time Lee's opponent had an organised crime background, and there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life.

The 15-year-old had a ventricular assist device, or VAD, implanted on Friday at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, family friend Mark Bell told CNN. A VAD is a mechanical pump that's used to support heart function and blood flow in people who have weakened hearts, according to the National Institutes of Health. It includes a small tube that carries blood out of the heart into a pump, and another tube carries blood from the pump to blood vessels. The vessels deliver the blood to the body.

Context: William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh. 'Not that this isn't fascinating, but did you seriously call me out to Denny's at 3 am for this?' Question: What did William say contributed to Dick's drug abuse problem? Options:  A. not enough information  B. the abuse suffered by his parents  C. the divorce from his wife  D. the death of his sister Jane Answer:","output":"D. the death of his sister Jane"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Facebook's new buy button. Facebook is testing a new 'buy' button on its website that will let consumers purchase and pay for products without have to leave the site. The button wil appear in ads, and take users to a page to process their payment. The new service, which Facebook described as a test with a 'few small and medium-sized businesses' in the United States, represents the Internet social networking company's latest effort to play a bigger role in the e-commerce business. Facebook said its new Buy button will be available on the mobile and desktop PC version of its website and will allow consumers to purchase goods directly from participating businesses. 'None of the credit or debit card information people share with Facebook when completing a transaction will be shared with other advertisers, and people can select whether or not they’d like to save payment information for future purchases,' the company said in a blog post. Facebook is not currently taking any portion of the revenue for products sold with the Buy button, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Credit card transactions will be handled by a third-party payment processing company, the person said. Facebook in 2012 introduced a way for its users to buy their friends gifts such as socks and teddy bears. However, Facebook stopped selling physical goods through the service after a year, letting consumers buy only gift cards instead. The button will allow people to buy without having to leave Facebook's app. 'We’ve built this feature with privacy in mind, and have taken steps to help make the payment experience safe and secure, the firm said.

Question: What does Armstrong receive? Title: Torn Curtain Movie plot: Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), an American physicist and rocket scientist, is traveling to a conference in Copenhagen with his assistant and fiancÃ©e, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews). Armstrong receives a radiogram to pick up a book in Copenhagen; it contains a message which says, \\"Contact Ï in case [of emergency.]\\" He tells Sherman he is going to Stockholm, but she discovers he is flying to East Berlin and follows him. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the East German government. Sherman realizes that Armstrong has defected, and is appalled that, given the circumstances of the Cold War, if she stays with him, she will likely never see her home or family again. Armstrong visits a contact, a \\"farmer\\" (Mort Mills), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment, in order to learn how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt (Ludwig Donath) and by extension, the Soviet Union, knows about anti-missile systems. Armstrong has made preparations to return to the West via an escape network, known as Ï. However, he was followed to the farm by his official guard, Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), an East German security officer. Gromek realizes what Ï is and that Armstrong is a double agent, and as Gromek is calling the police, a tortuous fight scene commences that ends with Gromek being killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife (Carolyn Conwell). Gromek and his motorcycle are then buried. The taxicab driver (Peter Lorre Jr., uncredited) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, reports on Armstrong's behavior to the police. Visiting the physics faculty of Karl Marx University in Leipzig, Armstrong's interview with the scientists ends abruptly when he is questioned by security officials about the missing Gromek. The faculty try to interrogate Sherman about her knowledge of the American \\"Gamma Five\\" anti-missile program, but she refuses to cooperate and runs from the room, even though she has agreed to defect to East...

Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen?  Hint: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. The answer to this question is:","output":"The Mures river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. This is because, as mentioned in the hint, faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow-moving water of pools. Since the Olt river was fast-moving and the Mures river was slow-moving and deep, the Mures river would have a lower concentration of dissolved oxygen in comparison to the Olt river."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries).  - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","output":"It is not possible to tell whether we can conclude \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" from the given statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" First, let us break down the components of both statements: 1. \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\"    Here, we have the following information:    - The subject is a motocross biker.    - The biker is in the middle of a turn during a race. 2. \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race.\\"    In this statement, we have:    - The subject is a motocross racer    - The racer is turning his gsxr during a race. Now, let's analyze the differences between these two statements: 1. \\"Biker\\" vs. \\"Racer\\":    While both terms are related, they are not exactly synonymous. A motocross biker might simply refer to an individual who rides a motocross bike, whereas a motocross racer refers to someone who competes in motocross races. However, since both statements are describing a person who is participating in a race, we can assume that these terms are interchangeable in this context. 2. The \\"gsxr\\":    The main difference between the two statements is the inclusion of the \\"gsxr\\" in the second statement. A gsxr is a type of sport motorcycle manufactured by Suzuki. It is important to note that although gsxr motorcycles can be used for racing, they are not specifically designed for motocross races. Motocross races usually involve off-road, dirt tracks with jumps and obstacles, requiring specialized bikes with specific features such as long-travel suspension, off-road tires, and lightweight construction. The gsxr, on the other hand, is a sportbike built for use on paved race tracks and public roads. Given these differences, it is not possible to tell whether the statement \\"A motocross racer turns his gsxr during a race\\" can be concluded from the original statement \\"A motocross biker rides mid-turn in the middle of a race.\\" The presence of the gsxr in the second statement introduces an additional piece of information that is not present or implied in the first statement. While we know that the biker in the first statement rides mid-turn, we cannot make any conclusions about the type of motorcycle being ridden or whether it is a gsxr in this context.

Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? Why do you need to commit totally to your diet? - In order to reach your goals and become in tune with your body - not enough information - to utilize the diet books and magazine you have bought - to burn that fat off your body The answer is:","output":"In order to break free from the diet cycle mentality, it is essential to change your mindset and approach to weight loss and health. The belief that there is a magic cure or one last diet that will solve your weight issues may be doing more harm than good. It's important to recognize that no single diet will work for everyone, and permanent weight loss requires a sustainable lifestyle change rather than a temporary fix. To truly break free from the diet cycle, consider the following: 1. Acknowledge that there is no magic cure or one-size-fits-all diet. Instead, focus on finding a balanced and sustainable approach to eating that meets your individual needs, preferences, and lifestyle. 2. Recognize that committing totally to a diet may not be the answer. Extreme commitment can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food and may even result in bingeing or regaining the weight once the diet ends. Instead, strive for consistency and moderation. 3. Learn to listen to your body's hunger signals and practice mindful eating. Pay attention to when you're truly hungry and when you're full. Eating in tune with your body's needs can help prevent overeating and create a healthier relationship with food. 4. Focus on developing a genuine love for health and fitness, beyond just losing weight. Find physical activities that you enjoy and incorporate them into your routine. Additionally, educate yourself on proper nutrition and overall well-being beyond the pages of diet books and magazines. 5. Be patient and realistic with your weight loss expectations. Remember that sustainable weight loss takes time, and progress may be slow. It's crucial to stay consistent, be kind to yourself, and remember that taking care of your body is a lifelong journey, not a temporary destination.

He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely.  Which iron bar was exposed to more water and oxygen, Iron Bar A or Iron Bar B? Answer:","output":"Iron Bar A was exposed to more water and oxygen compared to Iron Bar B. This is because it was placed outside on the porch during a rainy day, which provided a significant amount of water and atmospheric oxygen to react with the iron. The presence of both water and oxygen is essential for the process of rusting, also known as iron corrosion or oxidation. Rusting occurs when iron reacts with water and oxygen to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: 4 Fe (iron) + 6 H2O (water) + 3 O2 (oxygen) → 4 Fe(OH)3 (hydrated iron oxide) Iron Bar B, on the other hand, was placed in an airtight bag, and all the oxygen and air were removed to create a vacuum seal. This means that there was no water or oxygen available to react with the iron. Consequently, Iron Bar B did not rust at all. The difference in the rusting outcomes of Iron Bar A and Iron Bar B clearly demonstrates the significant role that water and oxygen play in the process of iron rusting. By exposing Iron Bar A to an environment rich in water and oxygen, you would naturally expect it to rust, while Iron Bar B, in its sealed environment, deprived of both necessary reactants, remained rust-free."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: -3538*a = -1219*a + 1472*a + 422099 + 55567 First, we will simplify the equation by combining the terms with \\"a\\" in it: -1219*a + 1472*a = 1472*a - 1219*a This equals to: 253*a So now our equation looks like: -3538*a = 253*a + 422099 + 55567 Now, let's get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 3538*a to both sides. When we add 3538*a to -3538*a, it becomes 0 (because -3538*a + 3538*a = 0). So, we have: 0 = 253*a + 3538*a + 422099 + 55567 Now, let's combine the \\"a\\" terms (253*a + 3538*a): 0 = 3791*a + 422099 + 55567 Next, we will combine the numbers: 422099 + 55567 = 477666 So our equation now looks like: 0 = 3791*a + 477666 Now, let's solve for \\"a\\". First, we will get rid of the 477666 by subtracting it from both sides: -477666 = 3791*a Finally, get \\"a\\" by dividing both sides by 3791: -477666 / 3791 = a When we do that, we find out that: a = -126 So our answer is: a = -126"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"The relationship between the truth values of these two sentences is not directly contingent upon one another. Truthfulness, in this case, is a measure of accuracy, logic, or factuality in a given statement or proposition. To determine the truth value of Sentence 1 \\"So oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there,” one would have to verify if the speaker actually has \\"them\\", presumably referring to oak trees. If the speaker indeed has oak trees around, then Sentence 1 would be true. If not, the sentence would be false. However, the truth value of Sentence 2 \\"I wish to have them as well, it is great that you do\\" isn't directly linked with the first sentence's truth value. This statement is expressing a personal wish or desire from the speaker, indicating they want to have \\"them\\" as well, implying oak trees. Even if the first sentence were false (i.e., the original speaker does not have oak trees), the second speaker's desire for oak trees could still be true. Therefore, the truth of Sentence 1 doesn't directly determine the truth of Sentence 2. Suppose we go further and interpret both of these sentences in a broader emotional or sentimental context, where 'truth' might indicate sincerity or belief. Even in this scenario, the truth value of Sentence 1 does not determine that of Sentence 2. The second speaker's wish or sentiment expressed in Sentence 2 could genuinely be their belief, regardless of the validity of Sentence 1. Summing up, truth in logic and facts is not determined by wishes or feelings. Therefore, even if Sentence 1 is true, it doesn't necessarily make Sentence 2 true, and vice versa.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Fed dollar concern shows how tight fix is: James Saft (James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own) EDINBURGH Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's new found strong dollar policy is in part a reflection of weakness, caught as he is between inflation and a still fragile economy and banking system. Bernanke on Tuesday deviated from the usual policy of leaving jawboning the dollar to the Treasury department, warning on the unwelcome inflationary effect of its continued fall. \\"We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations,\\" Bernanke said, nodding as well to its impact on the price of oil and other commodities. Given the situation -- the economy, particularly the banking system, is too weak to withstand higher rates but yet inflation is rising and risks becoming entrenched -- talking the dollar up and hopefully helping to moderate the price of energy is a sensible and low cost strategy. The problem of course is that Bernanke can't do much about demand from China and elsewhere for energy and other commodities and having drawn a line in the sand it is always possible, some might say inevitable, that he is asked to defend it. \\"Bernanke is signaling that he has reached the limits of how much dollar and commodity-driven inflation he can tolerate,\\" said John Kemp, an economist at Sempra Metals in London. \\"He is saying: If there is renewed slide in the dollar, if there is a renewed escalation in the oil price we will have no choice but to respond, no matter how painful that is.\\" It is the Treasury which has responsibility for the dollar and would make the call for intervention in currency markets to support it, if such a call came, but it is probably fair to presume that the Fed and Treasury are singing from the same song sheet, especially given recent stronger comments from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. It's worth noting too that a study published last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas laid at least part of the blame for the rising price of oil on a weak dollar. The paper, Crude Awakening: Behind the Surge in Oil Prices, by economists Stephen P. A. Brown, Raghav Virmani and Richard Alm found that about a third of oil's 60 per barrel rise between 2003 and 2007 could be laid at the feet of the falling dollar. Of course, there is that pesky other two-thirds of appreciation and as it is being driven by rising living standards in China and elsewhere it is largely outside the Fed's influence. There is no question that the recent run of data from the U.S. has shown a disturbing trend, especially in inflation expectations. The Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers final reading for May showed one-year inflation expectations surging to 5.2 percent -- the highest since February 1982 -- from 4.8 percent in April. And as for the Fed's mantra that inflation will fade over time, the public isn't buying it: five-year inflation expectations jumped to 3.4 percent, the highest since April 1995. \\"When inflation expectations show a significant rise -- as they have of late -- the standard central bank playbook prescribed tougher anti-inflation rhetoric,\\" Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw wrote in a note to clients. \\"However the economy is quite fragile at present and markets are jittery. Moreover, it's not clear that the threat of a tighter monetary policy would have much impact on households' inflation expectations in the current environment.\\" If the dollar did make another run lower, it's fair to expect more verbal intervention from the U.S. authorities rather than any quick move to actually buy dollars. And of course there is also the possibility that something out of Mr. Bernanke's control goes his way for once. Having peaked above 135 per barrel, U.S. crude fell on Wednesday to below 124 amid growing signs of at least the possibility of a fall in demand. Americans drove 11 billion miles less in March 2008 than a year earlier, the first time estimated travel on public roads fell in March since 1979 and the sharpest year-on-year drop in the 66 years records have been kept. Perhaps as significantly, India, which subsidizes fuel prices, hiked petrol and diesel prices by about ten percent, while Malaysia has junked all fuel subsidies, both moves that theoretically should help to curb demand for oil and could point the way to a trend in Asia. But it's important to remember that any U.S. desire to see a stable dollar is still vulnerable to cracks in the banking and financial system. The renewed focus on the health and prospects of Lehman Brothers LEH.N, which has seen its shares tumble in recent days, is a case in point. If we see another Bear Stearns-style run on an investment bank you can expect the Fed and Treasury's commitment to a strong and stable dollar to be tested, sorely. -- At the time of publication James Saft did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of  Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Write a summary based on this article: EXCLUSIVE: President Obama is planning to unveil a 10-part plan for overhauling U.S. immigration policy via executive action -- including suspending deportations for millions -- as early as next Friday, a source close to the White House told Fox News.      The president's plans were contained in a draft proposal from a U.S. government agency. The source said the plan could be announced as early as Nov. 21, though the date might slip a few days pending final White House approval.      Obama was briefed at the White House by Homeland Security officials before leaving on his Asia-Pacific trip last week, Fox News has learned.      White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama in Burma Thursday that the president had not made a final decision on any executive actions concerning immigration and would not announce any until he returned to Washington.      The draft plan, though, contains 10 initiatives that span everything from boosting border security to improving pay for immigration officers.      But the most controversial pertain to the millions who could get a deportation reprieve under what is known as \\"deferred action.\\"      More on this... Epic showdown over immigration on the horizon?      The plan calls for expanding deferred action for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children -- but also for the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.      The latter could allow upwards of 4.5 million illegal immigrant adults with U.S.-born children to stay, according to estimates.      Critics in the Senate say those who receive deferred action, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, receive work authorization in the United States, Social Security numbers and government-issued IDs.      Another portion that is sure to cause consternation among anti-\\"amnesty\\" lawmakers is a plan to expand deferred action for young people. In June 2012, Obama created such a program for illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, entered before June 2007 and were under 31 as of June 2012. The change would expand that to cover anyone who entered before they were 16, and change the cut-off from June 2007 to Jan. 1, 2010. This is estimated to make nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants eligible.      One of the architects for the president's planned executive actions at DHS is Esther Olavarria, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's former top immigration lawyer.      Under the changes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also would see a pay raise in order to \\"increase morale\\" within the ICE workforce.      DHS also is planning to \\"promote\\" the new naturalization process by giving a 50 percent discount on the first 10,000 applicants who come forward, with the exception of those who have income levels above 200 percent of the poverty level.      Tech jobs though a State Department immigrant visa program would offer another half-million immigrants a path to citizenship. This would include their spouses as well.      The other measures include calls to revise removal priorities to target serious criminals for deportation and end the program known as \\"Secure Communities\\" and start a new program.      The planning comes as immigrant advocates urge Obama to act. As lawmakers returned for a lame-duck session, Democrats in Congress on Wednesday implored Obama to take executive action.      \\"We're begging the president. Go big. These [illegal immigrants] are a plus to our nation. Mr. President, please. You said you were going to do something. Do it. Act now,\\" said Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif.      House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said: \\"I join with my colleagues in urging the president to take action. What he needs to do is give immediate relief to families who are being wrenched apart and living in fear.\\"      Angela Maria Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, touted executive action as a \\"tried and true component of immigration policy used by 11 presidents, 39 times in the last 60 years.\\"      She said for many undocumented immigrants who have been here for years, \\"there is no line for people to get into.\\"      Obama has vowed to act in the absence of congressional action and has claimed that congressional action could still supersede his executive steps. That claim was restated by Earnest, who said Thursday that if the House approved an immigration reform bill previously passed by the Senate, Obama would \\"retract\\" any executive order.      In a recent op-ed in Politico, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said Congress would stop Obama from taking executive action by adding language explicitly barring money from being used for that purpose. \\"Congress has the power of the purse. The president cannot spend a dime unless Congress appropriates it,\\" Sessions wrote. He also pointed out that similar language in the past has prevented the president from closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp.

You can follow him on Twitter: @LucasFoxNews ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama will ignore angry protests from Republicans and announce as soon as next week a broad overhaul of the nation’s immigration enforcement system that will protect up to five million unauthorized immigrants from the threat of deportation and provide many of them with work permits, according to administration officials who have direct knowledge of the plan.      Asserting his authority as president to enforce the nation’s laws with discretion, Mr. Obama intends to order changes that will significantly refocus the activities of the government’s 12,000 immigration agents. One key piece of the order, officials said, will allow many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain legal work documents and no longer worry about being discovered, separated from their families and sent away.      That part of Mr. Obama’s plan alone could affect as many as 3.3 million people who have been living in the United States illegally for at least five years, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research organization in Washington. But the White House is also considering a stricter policy that would limit the benefits to people who have lived in the country for at least 10 years, or about 2.5 million people.      Extending protections to more undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, and to their parents, could affect an additional one million or more if they are included in the final plan that the president announces. White House officials are also still debating whether to include protections for farm workers who have entered the country illegally but have been employed for years in the agriculture industry, a move that could affect hundreds of thousands of people. ||||| Summary:","output":"President Obama is planning a big change in the way we deal with immigration in the United States. He wants to create a 10-part plan that would help millions of people who came to the U.S. without permission to stay here without fearing they will be sent back to their home countries. This plan would also make it easier for some of these people to work and live in the United States. Some people think this is a good idea because it helps families stay together and makes our country more diverse and strong. Other people are worried that this plan might encourage more people to come to the U.S. without permission, and could make it harder for Americans to find jobs. This is a big decision, and President Obama wants to make sure everything is just right, so he is still thinking about all the details of the plan before he announces it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer a question about this article: The propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression, as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion. Many wars, and especially the Thirty Years' War, disrupted the university landscape throughout Europe at different times. War, plague, famine, regicide, and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities. Internal strife within the universities themselves, such as student brawling and absentee professors, acted to destabilize these institutions as well. Universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula, and the continued reliance on the works of Aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts. This era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state. As universities increasingly came under state control, or formed under the auspices of the state, the faculty governance model (begun by the University of Paris) became more and more prominent. Although the older student-controlled universities still existed, they slowly started to move toward this structural organization. Control of universities still tended to be independent, although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What areas were the introduction of the raccoon a success?, using the article: As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around Madrid since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized \\"the capture and death of any specimen\\". It is also present in Italy, with one reproductive population in Lombardy.About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former Soviet Union between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of Belarus between 1954 and 1958, and another in Azerbaijan between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the Caucasus region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile)., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The areas where the introduction of the raccoon was a success include: 1. Germany: As the article states, Germany hosts the largest population of raccoons outside of North America, which indicates a successful introduction. 2. Northern France: A stable population of raccoons exists in this area, resulting from the release of several pet raccoons by members of the U.S. Air Force near the Laon-Couvron Air Base in 1966. 3. Italy (Lombardy): The presence of a reproductive population in Lombardy indicates a successful introduction of raccoons in this area. 4. Belarus (south): Between 1954 and 1958, a successful introduction occurred in the south of Belarus. 5. Azerbaijan: Another successful introduction took place between 1941 and 1957 in Azerbaijan. These areas demonstrate that the introduction of the raccoon was a success, as evidenced by the establishment of stable and reproductive populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 for y.","output":"To solve the given equation 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 for y, we first need to simplify the equation and isolate the variable y. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Move all terms containing the variable y to one side of the equation. In this case, let's move the term 14004*y to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. This gives us: 0 = 14055*y - 14004*y - 612 Step 2: Combine like terms on the right side of the equation. Subtract 14004*y from 14055*y to get: 0 = 51*y - 612 Step 3: To isolate the variable y, we need to get rid of the constant -612 from the right side. We can do this by adding 612 to both sides of the equation: 612 = 51*y Step 4: Finally, to solve for y, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is 51: y = 612 ÷ 51 y = 12 So the solution to the equation 14004*y = 14055*y - 612 is y = 12."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Planet X had two large oceans. Ice ocean had few submarine volcanoes, while Tropical ocean had thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor.  Which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor? Answer:","output":"It is not possible to directly determine which ocean had fewer hydrophones on the ocean floor based solely on the information provided about the number of submarine volcanoes. Hydrophones are underwater microphones used to detect and record underwater sounds, and their presence is not directly related to the number of submarine volcanoes. However, we can attempt to infer a potential explanation. If researchers and scientists are more interested in monitoring the activity of underwater volcanoes, then they may place more hydrophones in the Tropical Ocean since it has thousands of active volcanoes on the ocean floor. This would mean that the Ice Ocean, with fewer submarine volcanoes, might have fewer hydrophones. However, this assumption is based on the premise that hydrophones are installed primarily for tracking volcanic activity, and without more information, we cannot definitively answer the question regarding hydrophone quantity in each ocean. Other factors, such as scientific research interests, accessibility, and budgetary constraints, could also influence the number of hydrophones installed in each ocean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A young man is in a bathroom attempting to shave his legs. he","output":"carefully positions himself on the edge of the tub, firmly gripping an ergonomically designed razor in his right hand. The smell of shaving foam fills the small, steamy room as he sprays an ample amount onto his hand and begins to methodically apply it to his left calf. He thoughtfully chose a fragrance-free foam, as he was always mindful of the sensitivity of his skin – a trait he inherited from his mother. Tiny droplets of water from the fogged-up mirror above the sink gradually roll down the glass, making an almost rhythmic sound as they splash onto the porcelain below. Drawing a deep breath, the young man braced himself for the first stroke of the blade. He recognized that to some, this might seem like a trivial or odd endeavor, yet for him, it was a right of passage in a personal journey towards self-discovery and acceptance. Memories of childhood filled his mind, as he recalled countless naïve questions his younger self had asked his father regarding why only his mother got to shave her legs. His father's dismissive laughter reverberated in his ears, echoing the conventional attitudes that had weighed on him like a heavy burden throughout his adolescence. With a renewed sense of determination, he slowly guided the razor along the contour of his calf muscles, being extra cautious not to nick his delicate skin in the process. Once the first shave was completed, he couldn't suppress a victorious smile as he rinsed the razor under the warm water, and the now detached hairs swirled down the drain. That smile was an affirmation of his ownership in defining his identity – a silent rebellion against the societal norms that tried to confine him. Upon completing the first leg, he carefully repeated the process on his right, remembering important tips he had learned from reading articles on the subject. With each slide of the razor, his confidence grew, and gradually, he saw his vision of himself – the person he truly wanted to be – materialize before his very eyes. For the first time in his life, he felt an unparalleled sense of freedom, as if he had finally unlocked a secret that set him apart from the rigid expectations placed upon him by others. With both legs now smoothly shaved, he marveled at the transformation he had accomplished in the confines of his own bathroom. Although it was only the first step in his journey, he knew that it signified to him a fundamental break from the constraints of his past. Wrapped in a newfound sense of empowerment, he vowed to embrace the aspects of himself that others questioned or misunderstood, and to never doubt his right to explore who he truly was. Meanwhile, outside the bathroom door, his sister waited impatiently, knocking loudly and complaining about how long he was taking. But inside that small, steamy space, a young man was reshaping his destiny, embarking on a path that would redefine his life and carve an uncharted trail for others who dared to challenge convention and forge their futures on their own terms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:-  They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process in the context provided involves the functioning of the kidneys, which are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering blood and removing waste products. This process maintains overall fluid and electrolyte balance, regulates blood pressure, and helps maintain proper pH levels in the body. The detailed first step of the process is described below: 1. Blood Supply and Filtration: The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta - the body's main artery supplying oxygen-rich blood from the heart. The renal artery further divides into arterioles and then into a network of tiny capillaries called glomeruli, which are surrounded by a complex of small tubules known as nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons that work together to filter waste and perform other crucial functions. In this initial step, filtration occurs when the blood flows through the glomerulus, a network of minuscule blood vessels with tiny pores. The pressure generated within these blood vessels pushes water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules out of the blood and into the adjacent capsule called Bowman's capsule, which encapsulates the glomerulus. This process creates a filtrate that lacks large molecules and cells such as proteins, red and white blood cells, and platelets, which are too large to pass through the pores of the glomerulus. This filtration step marks the beginning of blood purification and waste removal within the nephrons. The resulting filtrate is then processed further along the nephrons through a series of reabsorption, secretion, and concentration processes to remove waste, return valuable substances to the body, and maintain optimal levels of electrolytes and water. The intricate functioning of nephrons and the entire renal system underscores the kidneys' essential and complex role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Great Crow Battle of Portage Bay, which pits one family feeding birds against neighbors, has resulted in a 200,000 civil suit.      The great neighborhood crow war at Portage Bay has not ended, and not surprisingly, it’s lawsuit time. Say, 200,000?      Lisa and Gary Mann, and their young daughter, for a couple of years have been feeding the birds at their home in the 1000 block of East Shelby Street.      Says the lawsuit, “As many as six times per day Defendants refilled and continue to refill the emptied troughs of food with peanuts and other bird foods for the seagulls, crows, and pigeons to feast upon.”      Neighbors said that anywhere from 30 to 100 crows would hover during the feedings. You bet that they brought up the swarming, attacking avian images from Hitchcock’s 1963 horror film, “The Birds.”      The civil lawsuit, filed Monday in King County Superior Court, was brought by Christine Yokan, a pension-fund investment manager who lives on one side of the Manns, and Matt Ashbach, an ear, nose and throat doctor, who lives on the other side of the Manns. Gary Mann is a surgical oncologist.      The 200,000 sought in the lawsuit includes claims of property damage exceeding 75,000 for cleaning, painting and replacing permanently damaged property on houses, decks, yard lights, walkways, sheds.      Crow facts There are 40 species of crows, and they live everywhere except Antarctica.      They have numerous calls. A distress call brings other crows to their defense.      Crows will eat practically anything — roadkill, fast food, mice. An adult crow needs nearly ¾ of a pound of food daily.      The origin of “eating crow” has been lost. In one version, during the War of 1812, a British officer made an American soldier eat part of a crow he had shot in British territory.      It also includes a non-specified amount for loss “of enjoyment of property, inconvenience, and emotional distress.” And attorney’s fees.      Back in April, the neighbors had high hopes quiet would be restored.      In an email, Lisa Mann wrote that “we are moving to Houston this summer as my husband accepted a faculty surgical position … ”      But an online search doesn’t show the Mann residence up for sale, nor having been sold. Lisa Mann did not return voice-mail and email messages for comment.      Janice Palm, a psychotherapist who lives across the alley from the Manns, says she gave up putting flowers in her planters because the crows pulled them. She’s not part of the lawsuit.      She says about the Manns moving, “Only in our dreams.”      Meanwhile, the lawsuit says, “Large numbers of birds swarm the feeding operations daily, leaving behind dirt, feathers, peanut particles and shells, feces, and urine on the surrounding properties … Neighbors with family members who have severe peanut allergies have pled with Defendants … ”      That lawsuit describes a litany of illnesses carried by rodents, crows and pigeons.      And more, “ … there are also frequent periods of excessive noise from dozens of birds squawking from dawn until dusk.      “While some periods of time are quiet, there are periods of time — which sometimes exceed two hours in duration and occur multiple times per day — in which the cawing of crows and the noises from other birds continues unabated and can be heard at a high volume even when one is inside the home.”      And more, “Plaintiffs had never before observed a single rat on their properties. After defendants began feeding the wildlife, Plaintiffs observed a noticeable rat population … ”      It has been Lisa Mann who has had the most dealings with the neighbors. She also was the one quoted in a BBC News story (then reprinted in Crosscut, an online Seattle publication) that described in glowing terms the feeding of the crows.      It was titled, “The girl who gets gifts from birds.”      It told how the Manns’ 8-year-old daughter originally began sharing her school lunch with crows, and how that led to the birds leaving her gifts such as an earring or polished rock.      Katy Sewall, author of the BBC piece, never mentioned the neighborhood hassles over the crows in the story, which went worldwide. “The neighborhood tensions were never my focus,” she wrote in an email.      But the tensions certainly escalated.      At one point, Lisa Mann called the cops after an argument with a neighbor up the hill. The previous night, Mann told the cops, she had heard what sounded like rifle shots.      The neighbors, meanwhile, contacted the City Council and Public Health — Seattle & King County with a petition signed by 51 of them, asking for help.      Public Health did issue a notice of violation to the Manns for bird food accessible to rats. The Manns took the necessary measures, such as raising the feeder above ground and on smooth poles.      The confrontations continued.      In one email, Lisa Mann said that Matt Ashbach, her neighbor to the east who now is suing, took a dead crow “and illegally hung it in effigy off of his third-floor balcony of his million-dollar mansion.”      Ashbach says he did find a dead crow and hung it from his balcony, a method he learned growing up on a farm to warn off other crows. (Not illegal, according to Seattle Animal Shelter.)      Anna Johnsen, who represents Ashbach and Yokan, says a trial date has been set for a year from now — Aug. 6, 2016. A long time in crowing time.      “My clients hope the feeding will stop before then,” she says.      Meanwhile, Johnsen is asking the Manns to not feed the birds more than a quarter-pound of food a day.      “My clients don’t want to limit anyone’s freedom,” she says. “We think that’s very reasonable.”      Of course, that all depends on what your definition of reasonable is. ||||| By David Ham and KIRO 7 STAFF      Earlier this year a story about an 8-year-old Seattle girl’s relationship with crows went viral.            Gabi Mann started feeding crows daily two years ago and the birds would leave her trinkets.            However, her Portage Bay neighbors said the murder of crows would caw and leave droppings throughout the neighborhood.            “The neighbors went to her and said please this is causing a problem,” said neighbor Janice Palm.            >> KIRO 7 reported that the neighbors signed a petition to get Gabi’s family to stop feeding the crows.            “People are having rat problems in their houses with the waste from the crows and the peanut shells are all over the place,” said Palm            On Monday, two of those neighbors filed a lawsuit against Gabi’s parents Lisa and Gary Mann.            “The case is against two adults. The scope and scale of the feeding is not the work of a minor child. The mother, Lisa Mann, is responsible for the vast majority of the bird feeding. Gary and Lisa Mann have also constructed extraordinarily large feeding stations and hired employees to help carry out the feedings. The feeding and related activities have run nearly every day, year-round, from the morning hours to as late as midnight,” said Anna Johnsen, attorney for the two homeowners that filed the lawsuit.            In the lawsuit, other neighbors tried to talk with and write letters to Lisa and Gary Mann requesting “they stop or seriously downsize their mass wildlife feeding operation.” However the situation escalated.            “I can't imagine living in a neighborhood and ignoring what my neighbors are asking me to do, what's very very reasonable that's affecting us so much,” said Palm who is also considering joining the lawsuit.      Neighbors contacted city and state officials, stated in the lawsuit. But no significant action was done.            According to the lawsuit, neighbors say they're owed 200,000 for damage caused by the birds            The Manns have not responded to the lawsuit and a trial date has not been set.

One young girl in Seattle is luckier than most. She feeds the crows in her garden - and they bring her gifts in return.      Eight-year-old Gabi Mann sets a bead storage container on the dining room table, and clicks the lid open. This is her most precious collection.      \\"You may take a few close looks,\\" she says, \\"but don't touch.\\" It's a warning she's most likely practised on her younger brother. She laughs after saying it though. She is happy for the audience.      Inside the box are rows of small objects in clear plastic bags. One label reads: \\"Black table by feeder. 2:30 p.m. 09 Nov 2014.\\" Inside is a broken light bulb. Another bag contains small pieces of brown glass worn smooth by the sea. \\"Beer coloured glass,\\" as Gabi describes it.      Each item is individually wrapped and categorised. Gabi pulls a black zip out of a labelled bag and holds it up. \\"We keep it in as good condition as we can,\\" she says, before explaining this object is one of her favourites.      There's a miniature silver ball, a black button, a blue paper clip, a yellow bead, a faded black piece of foam, a blue Lego piece, and the list goes on. Many of them are scuffed and dirty. It is an odd assortment of objects for a little girl to treasure, but to Gabi these things are more valuable than gold.      Image copyright Katy Sewall      Image copyright Katy Sewall      She didn't gather this collection. Each item was a gift - given to her by crows.      She holds up a pearl coloured heart. It is her most-prized present. \\"It's showing me how much they love me.\\"      If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them John Marzluff, Prof of wildlife science      Gabi's relationship with the neighbourhood crows began accidentally in 2011. She was four years old, and prone to dropping food. She'd get out of the car, and a chicken nugget would tumble off her lap. A crow would rush in to recover it. Soon, the crows were watching for her, hoping for another bite.      As she got older, she rewarded their attention, by sharing her packed lunch on the way to the bus stop. Her brother joined in. Soon, crows were lining up in the afternoon to greet Gabi's bus, hoping for another feeding session.      Gabi's mother Lisa didn't mind that crows consumed most of the school lunches she packed. \\"I like that they love the animals and are willing to share,\\" she says, while admitting she never noticed crows until her daughter took an interest in them. \\"It was a kind of transformation. I never thought about birds.\\"      In 2013, Gabi and Lisa started offering food as a daily ritual, rather than dropping scraps from time to time.      Each morning, they fill the backyard birdbath with fresh water and cover bird-feeder platforms with peanuts. Gabi throws handfuls of dog food into the grass. As they work, crows assemble on the telephone lines, calling loudly to them.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gabi feeding birds in her garden      It was after they adopted this routine that the gifts started appearing.      The crows would clear the feeder of peanuts, and leave shiny trinkets on the empty tray; an earring, a hinge, a polished rock. There wasn't a pattern. Gifts showed up sporadically - anything shiny and small enough to fit in a crow's mouth.      One time it was a tiny piece of metal with the word \\"best\\" printed on it. \\"I don't know if they still have the part that says 'friend',\\" Gabi laughs, amused by the thought of a crow wearing a matching necklace.      When you see Gabi's collection, it's hard not to wish for gift-giving crows of your own.      \\"If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them,\\" advises John Marzluff, professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington. He specialises in birds, particularly crows and ravens.      Image copyright Lisa Mann      What food is best? \\"A few peanuts in the shell,\\" he says. \\"It's a high-energy food… and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground, so they hear it and they quickly habituate to your routine.\\"      Marzluff, and his colleague Mark Miller, did a study of crows and the people who feed them. They found that crows and people form a very personal relationship. \\"There's definitely a two-way communication going on there,\\" Marzluff says. \\"They understand each other's signals.\\"      The birds communicate by how they fly, how close they walk, and where they sit. The human learns their language and the crows learn their feeder's patterns and posture. They start to know and trust each other. Sometimes a crow leaves a gift.      But crow gifts are not guaranteed. \\"I can't say they always will (give presents),\\" Marzluff admits, having never received any gifts personally, \\"but I have seen an awful lot of things crows have brought people.\\"      Not all crows deliver shiny objects either. Sometimes they give the kind of presents \\"they would give to their mate\\", says Marzluff. \\"Courtship feeding, for example. So some people, their presents are dead baby birds that the crow brings in.\\"      Image copyright Lisa Mann      Gabi has been given some icky objects. Her mother threw out a rotting crab claw, for example.      Gabi points out a heavily rusted screw she prefers not to touch. It's labelled \\"Third Favorite.\\" Asking her why an untouchable object is in the favourites, she answers, \\"You don't' see a crow carrying around a screw that much. Unless it's trying to build its house.\\"      Lisa, Gabi's mom, regularly photographs the crows and charts their behaviour and interactions. Her most amazing gift came just a few weeks ago, when she lost a lens cap in a nearby alley while photographing a bald eagle as it circled over the neighbourhood.      Image copyright Lisa Mann      She didn't even have to look for it. It was sitting on the edge of the birdbath.      Had the crows returned it? Lisa logged on to her computer and pulled up their bird-cam. There was the crow she suspected. \\"You can see it bringing it into the yard. Walks it to the birdbath and actually spends time rinsing this lens cap.\\"      \\"I'm sure that it was intentional,\\" she smiles. \\"They watch us all the time. I'm sure they knew I dropped it. I'm sure they decided they wanted to return it.\\"      Writer and broadcaster Katy Sewall is co-host of The BitterSweet Life podcast.\\" She's been a journalist and radio professional for 12 years.

Nottingham remains a strong centre for research into MRI. The university has contributed to a number of other significant scientific advances. Frederick Kipping, Professor of Chemistry (1897–1936), made the discovery of silicone polymers at Nottingham. Major developments in the in vitro culture of plants and micropropogation techniques were made by plant scientists at Nottingham, along with the first production of transgenic tomatoes by Don Grierson in the 1980s. Other innovations at the university include cochlear implants for deaf children and the brace-for-impact position used in aircraft. In 2015, the Assemble collective, of which the part-time Architecture Department tutor Joseph Halligan is a member, won the Turner Prize, Europe's most prestigious art award.

Mexican president held responsible for economic downturn, analysts say. PRI has 36.8 percent of vote to 27.9 percent for Calderon's PAN, news agency says. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: PAN President German Martinez Resigns After Party Loses Lead in Mexico's Lower House Election Hey kids, did you hear the news about Mexico? Let me tell you an interesting story! Once upon a time, there was a man named German Martinez. He was the president of a big team called the PAN political party in Mexico. They all work together to help make decisions for their country. But guess what happened? German decided to resign, or say \\"goodbye\\" to his job as president of the PAN party. This happened right after an important election, where PAN did not do very well.  Mexico has a big building called the \\"lower house,\\" where people from different teams come together to make choices for the country. In this election, PAN lost the lead, which means they didn't have the most people from their team in the lower house anymore. They lost to another team, called PRI, with 36.8% of the votes, while PAN only got 27.9% of the votes.  Remember Felipe Calderon? He was once the president of the whole Mexico, and he was also part of the PAN team. Some people believe that he is responsible for the PAN team doing poorly in the election because they think he didn't help the country's money situation get better when he was president. In Mexico, when people's lives become harder because of money problems, they may change their minds about which team should make decisions for their country. Now, after the election, many people are talking about the results and what it means for Mexico. Some people who study and think carefully about these things, called analysts, say that the Mexican president is responsible for the country not doing so well with money. This makes it hard for people to trust and vote for the PAN team. That's why the PRI team got more votes, and now they will have more people in the lower house to help make decisions for Mexico. So you see, kids, sometimes people and teams have to face difficulties. But this also means that they may learn, grow and become better in the future. Let's wait and see what happens with these political parties and Mexico! And that's the end of our story for today. I hope you enjoyed it!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures.  Now, I have a new situation: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low.  Answer this question please: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","output":"In the given situation, reaction B will proceed slower. This is due to the fact that it is being conducted at a lower temperature compared to reaction A. As mentioned in the background information, chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. This increase in temperature allows the particles in the reacting substances to have more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between the particles. This, in turn, increases the rate at which the reaction occurs. In contrast, when the temperature is lowered, the particles in the reacting substances have less kinetic energy, resulting in fewer and weaker collisions between particles. As a consequence, the reaction rate decreases. Therefore, in Alexander's college chemistry class, reaction A will proceed faster due to the higher temperature provided by the high strength burner, while reaction B will proceed slower due to the lower temperature from the weaker model of burner. It is important to note that other factors like the concentration of the reactants and the presence of catalysts can also influence the rate of the reactions, but in this specific example, temperature is the main factor causing the difference in reaction speeds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since Liam was reading about apex predators, he would naturally learn more about these related topics.  On the other hand, Fox was reading about grazers and large herbivores, which are lower down in the food chain. While these animals also play an important role in ecosystems, their study might not encompass wildlife management to the same extent as apex predators. Therefore, it can be inferred that Fox learned less about wildlife management during his research in comparison to Liam."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's what happened: The big champion team, Chelsea, who have won the FA Cup two times in a row, were very surprised during the weekend. They played a game against another team, Everton, in something called the \\"fourth-round replay\\". This means the two teams had already played once before, and they needed to play again to find out who's the best. But this time, Chelsea didn't win. Instead, Everton beat them, and they will now move on to the \\"last-16\\" of the competition. This is a group of 16 teams that will play more games against each other until there are only two left, who will then play in the final match. Everton said goodbye to Chelsea after winning an exciting \\"penalty shootout\\" part of the game by getting 4 soccer ball kicks into the goal, while Chelsea only managed to get 3. Another team called Manchester United also had a good day. They played against a \\"non-league side\\" team called Crawley. Don't worry too much about the \\"non-league side\\" part, it just means Crawley is not one of the best teams in England like Manchester United is. Manchester United won the game by scoring just one goal, which was enough for them to reach the \\"quarterfinals\\", meaning they are also moving forward in the big tournament. Some other Premier League teams - meaning they are really good teams that play in a special group of the best teams in England - named Birmingham and Stoke joined in the fun too. They played against \\"third-division opposition\\". This means they played against not very strong teams from a group that is not as good as the Premier League. Both Birmingham and Stoke were successful, beating their opponents and moving forward to the next stage of the FA Cup. So, kids, this fantastic weekend of football was full of happiness and sadness, surprises and thrills.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature. Who argued that Popper's falsificationism was just as logically untenable as Logical Positivism's verificationism?

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  Answer this question please: Who will have more restricted blood flow through their arteries? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jake is likely to have more restricted blood flow through his arteries compared to his son Ryan. The presence of a high amount of plaques in Jake's arterial walls indicates that he has developed atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of cholesterol and other materials within the arteries. This buildup can lead to the formation of plaques that can narrow the arteries and restrict blood flow. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present in his arterial walls during the examination. This suggests that he has not yet developed atherosclerosis and, as a result, his blood vessels should be relatively free from obstruction. Consequently, Ryan's blood flow through his arteries is expected to be less restricted compared to his father, Jake. Restricted blood flow through the arteries can have several consequences on the cardiovascular system. In Jake's case, the reduction in blood flow can lead to increased blood pressure, a lower supply of oxygen to the heart muscle, and a heightened risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack. This situation may require Jake to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including better dietary choices and regular exercise, to manage his atherosclerosis and minimize the potential risks associated with restricted blood flow. On the other hand, Ryan's lack of arterial plaques indicates that he currently has a lower risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack. Nonetheless, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and maintaining periodic check-ups will be essential for Ryan to reduce his long-term risk of developing atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular complications."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the question to: \\"Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance including allegory , hyperbole , and simile .\\"?

Increasing our knowledge of diverse aspects of life such as film, music, television, socio-political movements, and environmental sustainability provides us with a richer and more fulfilling life experience. By understanding these various fields, we become more confident and independent individuals who can contribute more meaningfully to our social circles and society at large. Pop Culture and Art: Affecting Everyday Lives Pop culture and art play a significant role in shaping our perspectives, beliefs, and values. Films, through their focus on diverse topics and unique storytelling techniques, help us navigate complicated emotions, empathize with others, and highlight essential global issues. For instance, films like \\"12 Years a Slave\\" have depicted the horrors of slavery, sparking essential public conversations on race and civil rights. In addition, music transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries, allowing us to connect with the emotions and stories of those from different backgrounds. From Afrobeat rhythms to K-pop anthems, music offers a world of diverse soundscapes that can unite us under a shared appreciation for artistic expression. Television has evolved over the past few decades, shifting from being purely for entertainment purposes to exploring complex characters and narratives in thought-provoking shows. Series like \\"Breaking Bad\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" demonstrate the versatility of television as a medium, keeping audiences engaged and promoting critical thinking about societal issues. Social and Political Movements: Inspiring Change Knowledge of social and political movements in one's area plays a crucial role in promoting awareness, empathy, and active participation in our society. From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s to the contemporary Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ rights movements, understanding social dynamics and historical context helps us appreciate the strides society has made, while also acknowledging the work that remains to be done. Participating in local social and political movements – whether it be attending rallies, volunteering, or engaging in informed conversations – allows us to stay informed and shape the future we wish to see.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal.  But I can use this background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells.  What is an answer for this question: Which sister had incomplete dominance? The answer is:","output":"Neither Mary nor Ann displays incomplete dominance in this situation. Incomplete dominance occurs when an individual inherits one dominant allele and one recessive allele (Ss), resulting in an intermediate phenotype. In the case of Mary and Ann: - Mary has sickle cell anemia, which means she is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait. All of her red blood cells have the incorrect hemoglobin, and there is no presence of the dominant allele in her genotype. - Ann is normal, which means she is either homozygous dominant (SS) or heterozygous (Ss). If Ann is homozygous dominant (SS), she has normal red blood cells and does not display incomplete dominance. If Ann is heterozygous (Ss), she carries the sickle cell trait but does not have the disease or any symptoms, as the dominant allele (S) completely masks the effects of the recessive allele (s). In either case, incomplete dominance is not present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

According to the information given in the sentence, Toynbee's report was compiled on the 24th of May, 1916. The sentence also informs us that the report specifically discusses events that occurred in the first year of the Genocide but does not account for subsequent deaths or killings that happened after the report's compilation date. To provide more context, Arnold Toynbee was a British historian who documented the Armenian Genocide through his work during the early 20th century. The Armenian Genocide refers to the systematic extermination of around 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, specifically between 1915 and 1923. Toynbee's report is considered a crucial and influential primary source that shed light on the atrocities committed during this period. The sentence in question indicates that the figure mentioned only accounts for the first year of the Genocide and does not include any additional information on the subsequent years and consequences that followed.

Luis Gutierrez speaks before a meeting with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Chicago on Monday. Gutierrez refused to leave the meeting, saying he planned to risk arrest by staying at the agency’s office until he received the answers he sought.      Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez was briefly handcuffed after refusing to leave a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Chicago, saying he planned to risk arrest by staying at the agency’s office in The Loop until demands are met.      The Democratic congressman led a sit-in following a meeting that began around 10 a.m. Monday with a delegation of activists that included about 22 advocates, attorneys, community leaders and other local elected officials, according to Gutierrez's spokesman Douglas Rivlin.      “They were asking about specific cases and about the general conduct of ICE and deportations,” Rivlin said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “The congressman has decided that he did not get the answers he was looking for from the ICE regional director and he’s going to be staying inside until he gets answers, even if that means risking arrest.”      Seven others from the meeting refused to leave alongside Gutierrez, who tweeted that he “was arrested, cuffed then cuffs were cut off” around 1:30 p.m. “Waiting for further word on if/when we will be arrested.”      Specific immigration cases discussed in the meeting included the pending deportations of Army veteran Miguel Perez Jr., according to Rivlin, as well as Francisca Lino, whose husband and four of her six children are U.S. citizens.      \\"The congressman first met with the same ICE regional director in 2008 about this case, about getting a deferral from deportation,\\" Rivlin said. \\"Ms. Lino came in regularly for meetings with ICE every year as a condition for her deferred deportation, and a couple of weeks ago she was told that she would need to get her bags together and has a specific date for when she is going to be deported in July.

(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)      CHICAGO — U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez and several immigrant advocates were briefly placed in restraints by federal officers after they staged a sit-in at the regional office of the Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency on Monday to protest the Trump administration’s increased targeting of undocumented immigrants for deportation.      Gutierrez, D-Ill., and activists began their sit-in at the Chicago office after a contentious meeting with ICE officials. The lawmaker said that he stood ready to be arrested when he started the protest late Monday morning, but ended the sit-in more than four hours later without incident.      Federal Protective Service officers gave the congressman and seven immigration advocates taking part-in the sit-in three warnings to leave the facility or face arrest, according to Gail Montenegro, an ICE spokeswoman. At one point, Gutierrez posted on social media that he was even placed in handcuffs but agents changed their mind and allowed the sit-in to continue.      Montenegro said federal agents removed the flex cuffs within approximately two minutes, after ICE officials relayed to the FPS officers that they no longer wanted the congressman and others removed from the building.      \\"They threatened us with arrest. We said 'We're ready to go to jail,'\\" Gutierrez told reporters after ending the protest. \\"We stood up to the bullies here...Unfortunately, tonight and tomorrow they will continue to prey on very vulnerable, defenseless people in their homes in the darkness of the night.\\"      The congressman said he decided to start the sit-in after he felt he received unsatisfactory or incomplete answers from ICE officials about whether they would carry out enforcement raids in churches and other sensitive locations.      Gutierrez also said he did not receive clear answers on whether the agency would target young undocumented immigrants living in the US under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy started under the Obama administration. The agency said in a statement that the sit-in began after the \\"Congressman sought actions and assurances that ICE officials couldn't provide.\\"      Last week, ICE wrote on its Twitter that “DACA is not a protected legal status, but active DACA recipients are typically a lower level of enforcement priority.” The program provided hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants—commonly referred to as DREAMers— brought to the U.S. as children certain protections.

They also make clear that ICE agents should also arrest and initiate deportation proceedings against any other undocumented immigrant they encounter.      Gutierrez said he also questioned ICE officials about the scheduled deportations of several immigrants living in the Chicago area.      One, Miguel Perez, is a Mexican-born legal permanent resident and Army veteran and is facing deportation after a felony drug conviction. Perez served two tours in Afghanistan.

When the story opens, he's waiting for a pickup from his new partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott). They drive to a marina just outside of Washington DC to meet with a counterfeiter, Mendoza (Tobin Bell). Frank and Al are posing as buyers of false currency. Mendoza asks Al to board his yacht; after Al leaves, Mendoza reveals to Frank that he's been suspicious about Al, and figured out that Al is a Secret Service agent.When Frank boards the boat he sees that Mendoza's thugs have bound and gagged Al. Mendoza wants Frank to shoot Al as a test of loyalty. As Frank approaches, he hefts Mendoza's pistol, points it at Al's head and pulls the trigger. The pistol dry-fires and a thug slips a plastic bag over Al's head. Frank asks for his pistol back, IDs himself as an agent and shoots both of Mendoza's thugs. Mendoza tries to shoot Frank, but his weapon jams, and he is quickly captured. Frank later admits to Al that the pistol could have had at least one round in the chamber.A few days later, Frank investigates a complaint from an elderly landlady who says that one of her tenants, Joseph McCrawley, has been acting mysteriously. When he enters the man's apartment, he finds paraphernalia related to several presidential assassinations, especially John F. Kennedy's.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

I also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist, so if you haven't some of this might not make sense. Plot: This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, and destiny, and choice, and forced to endure the long, torturous platitude sessions that contain them. Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are a lot of revelations in this movie, which I'll be vague about so they won't seem like spoilers. *If you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie, don't read the paragraph below.* The strength and weakness of faith is revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology, are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail, so I will refrain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks). Btw, by \\"revealed\\" I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails. Storyline: So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it's going out of style (and after this display, I'm hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more). More on that later. To not spoil anything, I will say no more than the promo material already did: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts. The movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off. Action: While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used and waved in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome. I've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences--especially the \\"Smith fight\\" we all heard would be in the movie--to be too long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured. These fights scenes do neither. They are over-stylized, over-the-top sequences that are wooden and uninspired. In the first movie, there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting was for survival, not just looking good (which I honestly don't think they manage in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are--you won't regret it. In addition, the \\"Matrix abilities\\" people have in Reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they weren't too glaring--unlike Reloaded. Special effects are poured on and on and on. Every little thing someone does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, are slow-moed, bullet-timed, or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction. It's evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and boy did they throw it, with no real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given, which brings us to. . . Character and dialogue: I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience's face, or neglecting it altogether. The audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own. Keanu's acting performance is stiff at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that's about all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat throughout. With the script he is provided, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat. Moss isn't very believable either. Her look of concern is always the same, much like Keanu's, and the chemistry isn't there, although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough. Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program, but he too suffered from the script's hand. I actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene. All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how it's supposed to be taken), it's still horrible. I don't see The Matrix as deep, but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I don't have a lot of hope left for that after this film.

Young Sheffield residents Ruth Beckett (Karen Meagher) and Jimmy Kemp (Reece Dinsdale) are planning to marry due to her unplanned pregnancy. Meanwhile, as tensions between the US and the Soviet Union over Iran escalate, the Home Office directs Sheffield City Council to assemble an emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift bomb shelter in the basement of the town hall. After the ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain is gripped by fear, with looting and rioting erupting. \\"Known subversives\\" (including peace activists and some trade unionists) are arrested and interned under the Emergency Powers Act.

At 8:30Â a.m. GMT (3:30 in Washington, suggesting the Soviets fire first) on 26 May, the town hall office transmitter signals Attack Warning Red, and Sheffield's air raid sirens sound. Panic breaks out in the city and the Sheffield operations staff man their desks. At 8:35Â a.m. a single nuclear warhead air bursts high over the North Sea, producing an electromagnetic pulse which damages or destroys communications and most electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern Europe. Two minutes later the first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF Finningley 18 miles (29Â km) from Sheffield. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, the mushroom cloud from Finningley is clearly visible and chaos reigns in the streets, with Jimmy last seen running from his stalled truck in an attempt to reach Ruth. Sheffield is soon hit by a one megaton warhead launched at the Tinsley Viaduct.

Choices:  - liquid nitrogen - steam room - tidal waves - ocean - crushed ice  The rationale to choose \\"crushed ice\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Crushed Ice\\" The rationale to choose \\"crushed ice\\" as the answer is based on several key factors: 1. Effectiveness: Crushed ice is extremely effective in making your cup of water colder. This is because ice, being a solid form of water, has a lower temperature than liquid water. As you add crushed ice to your cup of water, the ice transfers its cold energy to the water, effectively lowering its temperature. 2. Availability: Crushed ice is readily accessible for most people. Many households have ice trays or ice makers in their refrigerators, making it easy to obtain crushed ice. In contrast, liquid nitrogen requires specialized handling and is not commonly found in homes. 3. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool down a cup of water is a safe method. In contrast, using liquid nitrogen can be dangerous due to its extremely cold temperature (-320°F/-195.8°C). Direct exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbite, and it requires specific safety precautions during handling. 4. Simplicity: Adding crushed ice to a cup of water is a simple and straightforward process. Conversely, using a steam room, tidal waves, or an ocean to cool down your water would likely be both impractical and inefficient. In conclusion, the best option for making your cup of water colder is to use crushed ice. Its effectiveness, availability, safety, and simplicity make it the most suitable choice among the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A person with understanding is aware of the consequences of their actions and the implications of the decisions they make. As a result, they are able to navigate their life's journey in a straight manner, avoiding any pitfalls or detours that may lead to failure or disappointment. In the Bible, the book of Proverbs contains several references to the importance and benefits of having understanding and wisdom. Proverbs 15:22 underscores the significance of counsel and guidance in one's life. When you have proper guidance, you are able to make informed decisions, which in turn result in success. This verse explains that without counsel, plans are more likely to fail. In other words, if an individual tries to accomplish something on their own, without seeking the advice of others who may have experience or knowledge in the matter, their endeavors may prove unsuccessful. Counsel takes many forms, such as seeking the guidance of trusted friends, consulting experts in a particular area, or even turning to God through prayer and scripture. It is important to remember that wisdom and understanding do not only come from one's own experiences or intelligence. Oftentimes, they can be gained from the insights and perspectives of others. Surrounding oneself with wise, experienced, or knowledgeable people and being open to their advice can significantly increase a person's chances of success. In conclusion, the passage \\"But a man of understanding keeps his way straight. 15:22 Where there is no counsel, plans fail,\\" highlights the importance of having guidance and seeking advice from others to ensure success. By fostering wisdom and understanding in one's life, it becomes easier to navigate the complexities of this world and achieve a straight path toward one's goals and aspirations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"Three men working on building something with bricks.\\", can we conclude \\"A group of men are watching a football game.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A group of men are watching a football game\\" based on the statement \\"Three men working on building something with bricks.\\" These two statements describe completely different scenarios, and there is no direct correlation or connection between them. Let's analyze both statements for better understanding. In the first statement, we have three men who are involved in a construction-related activity. They are working together to build something using bricks as the primary building material. This scenario focuses on a physical task that requires skills and effort related to construction or masonry. On the other hand, the second statement talks about a group of men watching a football game. This scenario involves people gathered together, possibly in a house, stadium, or public venue to enjoy a sporting event. Their primary activity is the passive observation of the game rather than actively working or constructing something. As we can see, these statements describe distinct situations that serve different purposes and involve unique activities. Thus, we cannot conclude that one is true simply based on the other being true. There is no given information or context that allows us to link the two statements or imply causality, relation, or connection between the building activity mentioned in the first statement and the football-watching scenario described in the second statement. In conclusion, while both statements contain groups of people engaging in an activity, the nature of the activities themselves and the given information prevents us from assuming any connection between them. Therefore, the presence of three men working on building something with bricks does not allow us to conclude that a group of men is watching a football game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As you may recall, my previous connection to the morgue was severed after that unfortunate incident during our last procurement attempt. The authorities have tightened security, and even the most skilled hacker would struggle to bypass their updated protocols. It would be too risky, and the resulting fallout would undoubtedly draw attention to our activities - not to mention the severe legal consequences we would face if caught. So, for now, acquiring a body through the morgue is no longer a viable option. Two: morality. Yes, we have been known to bend or break the rules in the pursuit of our goals. However, tampering with the dead is not a path I'm willing to tread lightly. Desecrating a corpse goes against the fundamental understanding of respecting the deceased and their grieving loved ones. Although our intentions may not be malicious, we must always weigh the ethical implications of our actions and strive to maintain a certain standard when it comes to the treatment of the departed. That being said, we must find an alternative solution to secure the body we need. Our most promising possibility is to establish connections with medical research centers and institutions that conduct anatomical studies. By presenting ourselves as legitimate researchers or scientists looking to further our understanding of a specific field, we might be able to obtain a donated cadaver without arousing suspicion. Of course, this approach will require meticulous planning and attention to detail. First, we'll have to create credible backgrounds and credentials for ourselves. This could involve forging degrees, certifications, and even creating a comprehensive online presence that showcases our fake professional histories. We'll also need to establish connections with influential individuals in our target research institutions, which may be achieved through networking events, conferences, or even online forums relevant to our chosen field of study. Once we have successfully infiltrated the medical research community, we'll need to identify a suitable body donor. Ideally, we want someone in relatively good health, with minimal physical abnormalities or injuries. In addition to reviewing the public donor registry, we might also consider contacting oncology wards, palliative care facilities, or organ transplant centers to inquire about potential donors who have recently passed away. Once we've secured a suitable cadaver, we must be cautious in our transportation and handling of the body to avoid any breaches in protocol or biohazard containment. We would have to make arrangements for a sterile and secure environment to carry out our plan, ideally an abandoned warehouse or secluded laboratory. Proper protective measures, such as wearing hazmat suits and employing air filtration systems, will also be essential to ensure our safety and prevent contamination. In conclusion, although obtaining a body from the morgue is no longer possible, we still have options on the table. By meticulously planning our infiltration into the medical research community and securing a legally and ethically sourced cadaver, we will be able to continue on our path without abandoning our principles. Our path may be more difficult, but ultimately it will ensure we maintain our integrity and avoid unnecessary trouble with the law."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every year there is the Spring Festival in China.

Q:Information:  - The FAL, or Fusil Automatique Léger (\\"Light Automatic Rifle\\"), is a semi-automatic/selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.  - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC .  - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal)  self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN  is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe.  - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s.  - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP.  - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.

He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers.

How do you do this: how do you stay above water in the ocean?","output":"Staying afloat in the ocean requires a few key elements: 1. Staying Calm: This is crucial for survival in not just ocean situations, but any life-threatening situation. Panicking can cause you to swallow water, struggle unnecessarily, and quickly deplete your stamina. Stay as calm as possible to save vital energy. 2. Float on your back: Lay flat on your back in the water, spread out your arms and legs, and arch your back. With your head tilted back, your body should stay at the water's surface, allowing you to float. Your buoyancy in this position is usually enough to keep your face above water. 3. Treading Water: Develop a good treading water technique. This involves a scissoring motion with your legs and a sweeping motion with your arms to maintain buoyancy and keep your head above water.  4. Regular breathing: Even if you are not a good swimmer, you can still keep afloat by just lying on your back and kicking the water at a slow but regular pace. Remember to breathe regularly so you don't build up carbon dioxide, which could make you want to breathe faster and risk swallowing water. 5. Using a flotation device: If you are on a boat and foresee the chance of ending up in the water, it is always a good idea to have a life-vest on. Even with no experience in swimming, a life vest keeps you afloat. To summarize, the key factors in staying afloat are staying calm, knowing how to float on your back and tread water, and possessing a flotation device if possible.

She was put on hold.      \\"I was like maybe when I'm on hold right now, she will just offer me 8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn't do that,\\" Jensen told WDAF.      The manager returned and told Jensen she was fired for discussing wages, which is against policy. Next, she called Jake and fired him.      \\"She said you're fired,\\" Jake told WDAF. \\"Basically just like a 10 second phone call.\\"      Neither teen had ever been told that discussing wages was against policy.      © Provided by Seventeen      Attorney David White told WDAF that the National Labor Relations Board says it's appropriate to discuss wages, which gives White reason to believe that Jensen could reasonably retaliate in court.      \\"At face value it appears, that the young lady was terminated because she complained about unequal wages. That's illegal,\\" White told WDAF. \\"Probably what happened - they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain.\\"      Jensen isn't sure yet if she'll take any official legal action, but she still wants to fully understand why she wasn't given equal pay.      \\"They should definitely be ashamed of themselves,\\" she said.      You might be wondering, why is a quarter such a big deal?      Well, it's not just Jensen. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR), there was a 21-percent wage gap between full-time male and female workers in 2014. And those numbers are even worse for women of color. Equal pay is a huge issue that affects millions of Americans. You work hard for your money - just as hard (or even harder!) than your male counterparts do. You deserve to be rewarded just the same. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video      KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- A metro teenager says she was fired from her job, after questioning why she didn’t make as much as her male coworker. The teen was hired at Pizza Studio in the Legends but was fired an hour later after asking her boss about her wage. Friday night, metro lawyers say she could have a pretty big lawsuit on her hands.      Seventeen-year-old Jensen Walcott was excited for her interview at Pizza Studio in the Legends Outlet Mall, especially after hearing one of her good friends, 17-year-old Jake Reed had just been hired the same day.      “She sent me a message like omg I have an interview at 3,” Reed said.      Jensen was interviewed and hired on the spot.      “She said good news, you got the job,” Jensen said.      Jensen left immediately and called Jake to share the news, they’d be working together.      “We were excited. We were super excited.”      But soon, that excitement turned to confusion after Jake told her, he was making 8.25 an hour. She was hired for 8 an hour. The two are the same age, have the same amount of experience and were hired for the same position. Jensen thought for sure it was just a mix up and called her new boss, asking why her wage differed from Jake’s. The manager put her on hold.      “I was like maybe when I'm on hold right now, she will just offer me 8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn't do that,” Jensen said.      The manager got back on the phone and told Jensen she was fired because discussing wages is against its policy.      “She said you're fired. Basically just like a 10 second phone call,” Reed said.      Both teens were terminated hours after being hired, for discussing their wages.      “At any point did they say to you, do not discuss this, it is our policy?” FOX 4’s Megan Brilley asked.      “No. Not once,” the two teens said.      “At face value it appears, that the young lady was terminated because she complained about unequal wages. That's illegal,” said attorney David White.      White says the National Labor Relations Board has given guidance saying you can discuss wages. White believes Jensen may have a claim for retaliation.      “Probably what happened- they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain,” White said.      On the contrary. Jensen doesn’t know if she will file any official action. She just wants to know, why she wasn’t given the same pay as her friend.      “They should definitely be ashamed of themselves,” she said.      FOX 4 did reach out to Pizza Studio. We explained the situation to corporate reps, who said the incident “sounded strange.” The representative said he would get to the bottom of it and call FOX 4 back. He never did. ||||| Only seven years after the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was written into law by Barack Obama, an act named for the woman who wouldn't take pay discrimination lying down, a junior version of the fair-pay queen has risen in Kansas City, Kansas. A teen, a hero, a pay-discrimination advocate before even heading off to college.      When 17-year-old Jensen Walcott was hired at a pizza spot in her local outlet mall, she was excited to hear that she would be joining her friend Jake Reed on the job, who had been hired on the exact same day. When she and Reed discussed their roles, however, she discovered that Reed had been hired at 8.25 an hour, while Walcott had been hired at 8 an hour. Considering the fact that the pair had the same work experience and are the same age and were hired for the same role, this seemed like a clear case of pay discrimination. So Walcott did something about it.      The teen called her new manager to ask why it would be that Reed was given a quarter more than she was. Her manager put her on hold and came back to say that she had been fired because \\"discussing wages is against policy.\\" Reed was given the same treatment. But both teens assert that this policy was never talked about with them before being hired, and it is not illegal to discuss wages. Walcott could technically take legal action in this case, but all she's interested in is some answers.      The teens: They're doing okay! ||||| Editor’s note: After publishing this piece, we received the following communication from Ashleigh Siefker, Executive Director of Operations at Pizza Studio:      “Pizza Studio has fully investigated the incident and we want to be clear that gender did not play a role in determination of either salary, nor for any Pizza Studio employee. […] After an in-depth review, we are confident this instance was not one of gender-bias but rather a failure to assign the correct salary and a misunderstanding of our company policies by one of our employees; it should be noted the manager in communication with Miss Walcott is also a female. Pizza Studio did not agree however with how the manager handled the situation. We pride ourselves with treating our employees and guests with respect and open communication at all times. We have extended a formal apology to both Miss Walcott and Mr. Reed and have parted ways with the responsible manager in the best interest of all parties involved. We plan to use this experience to better improve our hiring procedures and policies moving forward.”      ***      Wage inequality between men and women rears its ugly head again, this time for a Kansas teen that discovered her male friend was making more money than she was for the same job. When she questioned what she thought was an innocent mistake, her manager fired her.      Jensen Walcott, 17, began her job at Pizza Studio for 8 an hour, excited to finally land a summer job. She was also delighted when she learned that her good friend Jake Reed, also 17, would be working with her. That is, until she learned that even with the exact same experience and skill set, he was hired at 8.25 an hour.      When she asked her manager to fix the problem, her manager fired her and Jake for discussing wages, apparently against policy for Pizza Studio. This does not, however, address the question of why they were paid unequal wages in the first place.      According to the National Labor Relations Board, it’s entirely appropriate for employees to discuss wages. And despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires that men and women in the same work place be given equal pay for equal work, the “gender gap” in pay continues to this day. According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), there was a 21-percent wage gap between full-time male and female workers in 2014. The pay gap is even greater for African-American and Latina women, with African-American women earning .64 and Latina women earning .56 for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man.      Claudia Goldin recently discussed this for a Freakonomics radio session called “The True Story of the Gender Pay Gap.” Goldin is the first woman to get tenure in the Harvard economics department, so I’m going to go out on a limb and say she knows more about this than I do. Goldin cites several factors including “occupational segregation,” which essentially means men and women traditionally apply for jobs in different job sectors (i.e. more women are nurses and more men are doctors, though this gap is shrinking). Though in Jensen’s case, it appears she was simply paid less for having a vagina.      Also temporal flexibility, the ability to put in hours when you can, is more important to women because of the “parent penalty,” which Goldin says can also contribute to a difference in wages.      What everyone seems to be missing here is women place importance on this because we are required to be the more flexible worker in order to take care of our families. We are not doing less work. In fact, I know many women who work as much as possible in the office; take kids to activities, doctor appointments, make meals, and get them to bed; and THEN sit up until midnight finishing their day jobs. If the work is getting completed, this obligatory flexibility deserves less income why exactly?      There is also an inbred belief on the part of most women that they don’t want to seem “difficult” or “spoiled” by asking for more money. When Jennifer Lawrence found out she was being paid less than her male counterparts for American Hustle, she blamed herself because she was a “bad negotiator.” This does not seem to be a problem for men because men are acclimatized from an early age to believe they deserve more. This is not an insult to men, but an observation that the opportunity exists for all of us to instill the same belief in our young girls.      The fact that it is 2016 and we are still talking about this is ludicrous. Women make up nearly half of the U.S. labor force and are, in today’s society, more and more becoming the breadwinners for their families. When women are not paid equitably, everyone — including the men in their family — suffers.      This is not a gender problem, this is everyone’s problem.      h/t: MSN      Article Posted 3 years Ago ||||| Jensen Walcott may be the new hero of the equal pay for equal work movement.      The 17-year-old Kansas City, Kansas native was fired from her job at a pizza place in an outlet mall after she complained about receiving less pay than her male friend for doing the same job with the same amount of experience, according to New York magazine.      Jensen told local news station WDAF that she heard about a job at Pizza Studio in Kansas City from her friend Jake Reed, who had been hired that same day, and when she applied and got the job, she called to tell him how excited she was.      “We were super excited,” Jake told the news station.      But as the pair compared notes about what Jensen could expect from the new gig, she found out that she had been hired for the same job as her male friend for less money: she was offered 8 an hour, while Jake was offered 8.25 an hour, according to the report. They had the same level of experience.      Thinking it must be a mistake, Jensen called the Pizza Studio to ask the manager what was up, and the boss put her on hold.      “I was like, maybe when I’m on hold right now she’ll just offer me 8.25 and everything’s going to be good,” Jensen WDAF.      But that isn’t what happened. First, the boss fired Jensen, then she called up Jake and told him he was fired, too. Both allegedly violated the company policy of not discussing wages outside of work, which they had never been told, according to the report. It should also be noted that such a policy prohibiting employees from discussing their wages is illegal , and has been since 1935 for exactly this reason. Employees are allowed to discuss matters that pertain to their job \\"for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\\" according to the National Labor Relations Act.      “She said you’re fired, basically, it was like a 10-second phone call,” Jake told WDAF.      Attorney David White told WDAF that discussing wages is legal, according to the National Labor Relations Board, and that the case seemed to be clear-cut: Jensen was fired for complaining about unequal pay, he said.      “Probably what happened — they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain,” White said .      The incident comes just seven years after President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, which strengthened the options for recourse available to workers who allege that their employers discriminate based on sex when it comes to wages.

She lives in Dallas, Texas with her family where she enjoys reading, roller derby, and complaining about the heat.      Image: Martin Dimitrov/Getty Images      Print      School is officially out, which means teens everywhere will be flooding the seasonal job market, looking to make a little extra money slinging burgers, pulling shots and walking dogs. They don't expect to make a whole lot of cash at these endeavors, just a little something extra for a few fun outings or to save up for a bigger purchase, like a car. Still, every cent counts, whether you're a teenager or an adult.      That's why when a Kansas teenager found out she was making a quarter less an hour than her male co-worker — even though they were the same age with the same amount of experience — she brought it to her boss's attention, thinking he'd want to fix the flub. She ended up getting fired instead, and this is extremely not OK.      More: 13 funny graduation cap ideas that deserve an A+      In fact, there's tons of stuff about this story that fall squarely into the category of jacked up, beginning with the fact that the teen, whose name is Jensen Walcott, was being paid 8 an hour while her male co-worker was making 8.25. That's bad enough, because it suggests the trend of women being paid less for doing the same thing as their male co-workers begins as young as 17, which is how old both Walcott and her co-worker are.      But when the teen brought the discrepancy to her employer's attention, they fired both her and her male friend, Jake Reed, for discussing wages at work. Prohibiting talk about wages is a popular practice, and it's always been an ethically murky one. Ever since 2014, however, it's also an unenforceable and illegal one thanks to an executive order from President Obama that bars employers from retaliating against employees seeking fair wages.      More: I have to be honest: Other parents scare me more than pedophiles      Both of those things are equally disturbing, but arguably the worst part of all of this is that we are regularly telling our children to do the right thing. That's what it appears the two friends were doing. Walcott and Reed were already friends, so it's completely natural to assume they would talk about what was going into their paychecks. That Reed was upfront with his friend about how she was getting the short stick is commendable, and it means he did the right thing.      Then Walcott did what any employee with a brain would do: She stood up for her best interests and asked them to take the reasonable and ethically correct course and pay both her and her co-worker the same amount of money for exactly the same work. She also did the right thing.      They both were punished for it.      It doesn't have to stay that way. Pizza Studio, the teens' employer, was definitely in the wrong here, according to a labor attorney who spoke to a local news outlet after Walcott came forward. If she wanted to, she could seek recourse for herself and for her friend, and we hope she does.      More: Neighbors called the cops on these parents for their unusual punishment      Teaching our kids to do the right thing can sometimes seem like an uphill battle, especially in cases like this, where speaking out against inequality lands them in trouble. But we need to keep sending the message. It is seriously encouraging that Walcott at least recognizes that what her employer did was wrong. When we raise kids who understand inequity and that they're responsible for calling it out when they see it, we make it possible for them to stick up not just for themselves but for others as well.      That's important. It's important that the next generation looks out both for their best interests and the interests of those who may not feel safe coming forward for a variety of reasons. It means our kids might be able to accomplish what we might not in our lifetime, which is to do away with this kind of crap.      It might feel a little disheartening that the moral compass in this story were not the adults but two teens. But it shouldn't. It means that something we're saying is sticking, and if every kid speaks up the way these two did, we have a whole lot to be thankful for.

To fully address both questions, it is essential to explore the origins and implications of these contractions, as well as the regional differences in language usage. Question 1: \\"Why do Yankees say 'Math' instead of 'Maths' when the term is a contraction of 'Mathematics' (ie NOT 'Mathematic')?\\"   Yankees, referring to Americans in this context, generally use \\"Math\\" as a short form for \\"Mathematics\\". The reason for this is rooted in the differences between British and American English. In American English, the contraction \\"Math\\" has been adopted as the standard abbreviation for \\"Mathematics\\". This stems from the use of singular and collective nouns, which varies slightly between the two forms of English. In American English, some collective nouns tend to be treated as singular and thus take singular verbs, while in British English, they are more likely to be treated as plural and take plural verbs. For example, American English would treat \\"Mathematics\\" as a singular noun with a singular verb, resulting in the contraction \\"Math.\\"  It's important to note that there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed-upon answer as to why \\"math\\" was adopted in American English over \\"maths.\\" Specific historical and regional factors could have contributed to the pattern of usage, with the differing style gaining popularity across the United States over time. Question 2: \\"When people say 'Maths' instead of 'Math' are they indicating plurality in some way?\\" \\"Maths\\" is the standard contraction for \\"Mathematics\\" in British English, and other dialects, such as Australian English. Although \\"Mathematics\\" is a collective noun that refers to a field of study, it does indeed contain a plural element, as indicated by the \\"s\\" at the end of the word. British English, as mentioned earlier, tends to treat collective nouns as plural and use plural verbs with them. Thus, it is not surprising that \\"Mathematics\\" is contracted to \\"Maths\\" in British English, which retains that plural element. In essence, the use of \\"Maths\\" implies a plurality of concepts, such as the different branches or subsets of mathematical study (geometry, algebra, calculus, etc.). However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the user is referring to more than one specific calculation or process. In summary, the answers to these questions are not the same, as the first question focuses on the reasons behind the difference between American and British English's use of \\"Math\\" and \\"Maths,\\" while the second question explores the plurality aspect of the contraction \\"Maths\\". Both \\"Math\\" and \\"Maths\\" are acceptable contractions of \\"Mathematics,\\" and the choice between them is primarily determined by regional language conventions and a speaker's familiarity with those variations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a short story: Penelope kicks the ball along the grass surface of a soccer field, then later she kicks it with the same force along an artificial turf field. The ball rolls for a longer time on the artificial turf than it does on the grass, which is due to the more smooth surface of the (A) artificial turf (B) grass..  What is the most sensical answer between \\"artificial turf\\" and  \\"grass\\"? The answer to this question is:","output":"The most sensical answer between \\"artificial turf\\" and \\"grass\\" is (A) artificial turf. This is because artificial turf has a smoother surface compared to grass. When Penelope kicks the ball with the same force on both surfaces, a critical factor that determines how long and far the ball will roll is the friction between the ball and the surface it is rolling on. Friction is a force that resists the motion of two surfaces as they rub against each other, and it is affected by the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces involved. Grass, as a natural surface, tends to be more uneven and rougher than artificial turf. Grass blades can create additional resistance against the ball, and the soft, yielding nature of the soil underneath the grass can absorb some of the energy that the ball has, causing the ball to slow down more quickly. Moreover, natural grass fields are often affected by factors such as humidity and changes in weather conditions, which can further increase the inconsistency and roughness of the playing surface. Artificial turf, on the other hand, is made from synthetic fibers designed to mimic the appearance of grass. These fibers are usually more uniform and smoother in texture, and the surface created is less prone to the inconsistencies of natural grass. This translates to lower friction between the ball and the artificial turf, allowing the ball to roll for a longer time and distance when kicked with the same force compared to when it is kicked on a grass field. In conclusion, Penelope's observation that the ball rolls longer on the artificial turf can be attributed to the smoother surface provided by the artificial turf, which results in reduced friction acting on the ball and allows it to cover a greater distance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Here 's to Shutting Up is the eighth studio album by Superchunk .

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an   rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several...

The answer to the question: Who does Peter save from the shark? is inside the article: On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help.  The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded. They cuddle, and their bodies form a heart-shaped silhouette on the horizon., can you guess it ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, Peter saves Polly from the shark. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of how I came to this conclusion: 1. I read the article carefully to understand the story. 2. I identified the main characters involved in the incident: Peter the male penguin, Polly the female penguin, and the shark. 3. I noted that the shark begins to attack Polly while she is swimming on a small iceberg. 4. I recognized that Peter becomes aware of the danger and tries to warn Polly, but she ignores him thinking he is begging for forgiveness. 5. I observed that Peter then takes action by picking up a stick and charging out to help Polly. 6. I analyzed that Peter manages to hit the shark on the nose, making it chase after him instead of Polly. 7. I noticed that Peter uses a boulder to ultimately defeat the shark, saving Polly in the process. 8. I concluded that Peter saved Polly from the shark, as stated in the article.

Write an article based on this \\"The days when Apple had a free run for our smartphone hearts and minds are over.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Apple's Reign over the Smartphone Hearts and Minds: A Thing of the Past Introduction For more than a decade, Apple has been the uncontested ruler of the smartphone market, captivating millions of hearts and minds through innovative designs, unmatched performance, and unmatched user experiences. However, recent years have seen a surge in competition, giving customers a plethora of options to choose from. It is becoming evident that Apple's exclusive claim on consumer loyalty may no longer endure. This article will discuss the major reasons as to why Apple's free run for our smartphone hearts and minds is over and what challenges lay ahead for the tech giant. The Rise of Competitors One of the primary reasons that Apple enjoyed a significant run for so long was its status as the primary innovator in the smartphone industry. With the launch of the first iPhone back in 2007, Apple changed the world of communication forever. However, as time went on, various brands seized the opportunity to build on and improve upon Apple's innovations. 1. The Android Invasion: Arguably the most prominent challenger for Apple's throne has been Google's Android operating system (OS), which powers a majority of the world's smartphones today. The Android platform has provided Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with a robust and developer-friendly environment to craft their own unique experiences. This versatility and openness of Android have led to an increase in OEMs and resulted in a diverse array of devices catering to various price ranges and preferences. 2. Quality Devices at Affordable Prices: Companies like Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, and Xiaomi have significantly raised the bar for smartphone hardware and features. By offering premium-quality devices at competitive prices, they have managed to chip away at Apple's perceived exclusivity and superiority. 3. The Growth of Chinese Smartphone Makers: Chinese companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo have managed to rapidly expand their global footprint, often providing feature-packed devices at significantly lower costs than their competitors. Taking Notice of Consumer Needs Listening to customer demand and preferences plays a vital role in maintaining market dominance, and competitors have stepped up their game in this aspect. For instance, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 faced considerable backlash from users. Brands such as Samsung benefitted from public discontent by including the headphone jack in their flagship devices alongside other innovative features such as expandable storage, which offers flexibility and choice to its users. Software Innovation Apple's iOS has enjoyed a streamlined and cohesive user experience for years, but the Android OS has matured and improved exponentially in terms of performance, design, and overall user experience. As part of Android's evolution, regular feature updates, improved security, and a host of customization choices have narrowed the gap between iOS and Android, providing users more reasons to consider alternatives to Apple's products. Conclusion The days when Apple had a free run for our smartphone hearts and minds are indeed over. While Apple remains a dominant player in the smartphone market, an open battleground has emerged, with a multitude of options and features for customers to choose from. As the competition continues to intensify, it will be interesting to see the strategies adopted by Apple in the coming years in response to these challenges. We can expect innovation and evolution in both hardware and software, ultimately benefiting consumers as they become the driving force in an open and exciting smartphone landscape."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Solubility may increase or decrease with temperature; the magnitude of this temperature dependence varies widely among compounds. Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

Q:GoDaddy has pulled the plug on another online peddler of violence. The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer.

Summarize this article: Elon Musk has escalated his baseless attacks against a British diver, claiming without evidence that the man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a “child rapist” in an email to a reporter.      The embattled Tesla CEO faced widespread backlash in July when he first called the diver Vernon Unsworth a “pedo” in a tweet – an unfounded claim against a man who was part of the international team that freed 12 young footballers and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. Musk, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist the rescue mission, eventually apologized to Unsworth.      Elon Musk's 'pedo' claim is evidence only of his grossly inflated ego | Zoe Williams Read more      On Tuesday, however, BuzzFeed published two new emails from Musk, in which he called a journalist who has written about the dispute a “fucking asshole” and he launched new extraordinary claims against Unsworth, without providing documentation to support the allegations.      Musk called Unsworth a “single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years”, alleging that he had moved to Chiang Rai “for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time”. He asserted that the city was “renowned for child sex-trafficking”.      Ryan Mac (@RMac18) This was his first email to me after I asked him twice for comment on a legal threat from the rescuer's lawyer.            He prefaced the email with \\"off the record\\" though I did not agree to that condition. Off the record is a two-party agreement. pic.twitter.com/szknfOMg0s      BuzzFeed reported that it had investigated the allegations and Unsworth’s background, but could not verify any of the claims and said that it was unclear where the allegations originated.      Unsworth, who said he was considering legal action after the original insults on Twitter, is now moving forward with a lawsuit, his lawyer said in an email to the Guardian on Tuesday: “Elon Musk’s campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr Unsworth is inexcusable. Musk hopes to be sued and he deserves to be sued. He will be.”      Musk’s email to BuzzFeed, which was a response to Unsworth’s latest legal threats, said: “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole … As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me.”      Musk also defended his original effort to help the rescue mission in a follow-up email.      Musk confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that he had sent the emailbut did not immediately comment further. Tesla spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.      BuzzFeed said it could not locate any UK criminal records for Unsworth, 63, and also spoke with his girlfriend, who said she was 40 and had been with him for seven years.      The controversy comes at a time when Tesla and Musk continue to battle intense negative publicity and embarrassing controversies. His seemingly impulsive tweets have repeatedly led him into trouble. Notably, Musk recently tweeted that he had “secured” funding to take his electric car company private, which prompted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and backlash from investors.      Earlier this year, Tesla’s credit rating was downgraded to negative, with Moody’s citing a “significant shortfall” in the Model 3 production rate. The CEO also faced criticism after he slammed analysts on an earnings call in the spring, saying they should stop asking “boring, bonehead questions”.      After the first attack on Unsworth, some investors demanded an apology and criticized Musk for distracting from Tesla’s mission.      Julia Carrie Wong contributed reporting ||||| Elon Musk is apparently renewing his claims that a British diver who assisted in the rescue of a youth soccer team from a Thai cave earlier this year is a child molester.      In a July tweetstorm, the Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO labeled Vernon Unsworth, a diver who helped rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave, a \\"pedo guy,\\" after Unsworth criticized a submarine rescue plan the billionaire had proposed. The tweet has since been deleted and Musk apologized for the comment.      Musk doubled down on the accusation in an email sent last week to BuzzFeed News, calling Unsworth a \\"child rapist\\" who had moved to Thailand to take a child bride.      \\"I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f**king a**hole,\\" Musk wrote in an email that BuzzFeed published Tuesday. \\"He's an old, single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\\"      Musk has offered no evidence to support his claims, and Unsworth attorney L. Lin Wood denied the latest accusation in a statement to BuzzFeed News.      \\"Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,\\" Wood wrote in a statement. \\"After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.\\"      Musk's feud with Unsworth apparently began when Unsworth called Musk's involvement in the rescue effort a \\"PR stunt,\\" telling CNN his submarine wouldn't have made it 50 meters into the cave and saying Musk could \\"stick his submarine where it hurts.\\"      BuzzFeed also interviewed Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, Unsworth's 40-year-old girlfriend, who said they have been dating for seven years but declined to answer questions about their relationship.      Unsworth said in July he was considering legal action against Musk. Musk representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.      This article originally appeared on CNET. ||||| In an email to BuzzFeed News, Tesla CEO Elon Musk accused a Thai cave rescuer of moving to Thailand to take a child bride. The rescuer denied all the claims.      Soe Zeya Tun / Reuters British caver Vernon Unsworth at the Tham Luang cave complex during a search for members of a soccer team and their coach in Thailand in June.      Tesla CEO Elon Musk has renewed his attacks against a British man who played a key role in the rescue of a youth soccer team trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Musk last month apologized for accusing Vernon Unsworth of pedophilia after the diver questioned the value of Musk’s contribution to the rescue, a small submarine that ultimately went unused. But in a series of emails to BuzzFeed News, Musk repeated his original attacks on Unsworth — and made new and specific claims, lambasting the rescuer as a “child rapist” who had moved to the Southeast Asian country to take a child bride. Unsworth denied Musk's accusations through his attorney. Though Musk prefaced one email with “off the record,” BuzzFeed News did not agree to that condition of the correspondence. (Per common journalistic practice, a conversation is off the record only if both parties agree to the terms. ) BuzzFeed News first emailed Musk last Wednesday to ask for comment regarding a legal threat made by Unsworth’s lawyer in August after the Tesla CEO renewed his apparently evidenceless criticism of the rescuer in a Twitter argument the day before. Musk responded without addressing the substance of the legal threat. BuzzFeed News followed up twice, once on Wednesday and once on Thursday, and Musk responded with two separate emails.      “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.”      “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,” Musk wrote in the first message. “He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.” “As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me,” he added. It is unclear why Musk believes the allegations against Unsworth or what evidence he has to support them. Musk did not provide proof of his claims to BuzzFeed News, and BuzzFeed News could not verify any of the claims after reporting on Unsworth’s background.      BuzzFeed News      The Tesla CEO’s continued campaign against Unsworth offers a glimpse into the new ability of some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful figures to directly attack private citizens who cross them — and will test the capacity of traditional legal tools against them.      “Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,” Unsworth’s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, wrote in a statement. “After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.” A spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment on Musk's newest allegations, and referred to a previous statement issued by the board in response to a question about its support for the company's CEO. The feud began in July when Musk tweeted that Unsworth was “a pedo guy” after the rescuer called the billionaire’s attempt to use a custom-designed submarine in the rescue effort a “publicity stunt.” Musk later apologized and deleted this tweets, but revisited the claim last week in an argument on Twitter, asking why Unsworth hadn’t sued yet if the accusations were indeed untrue. BuzzFeed News then reported that Wood had actually sent Musk a letter warning of a possible defamation suit in early August. Musk’s renewed attacks on Unsworth come after a series of erratic public gestures, notably a widely publicized suggestion that he would take Tesla private and the narration of his home life by the rapper Azealia Banks. And the new accusations leveled at Unsworth threaten to undermine a recent charm offensive intended to frame the CEO’s erratic behavior as the actions of an overworked luminary struggling to maintain his world-changing businesses. It’s been a particularly difficult summer for the billionaire, marked by Tesla’s missed production goals, clashes with reporters, and his failed attempt to take his car company private. Despite that, Musk still managed to maintain a dispute with Unsworth, a 63-year-old cave explorer and diver, whom he has now accused of taking a child bride. BuzzFeed News could find no evidence to support that claim, and Musk did not provide any documentation to support his accusations. Publicly available legal documents do nothing to support Musk’s claims: BuzzFeed News could not immediately locate any criminal records for Unsworth in the UK. Separately, a Thai immigration official named Ploy Pailin told BuzzFeed News that an individual on a visa would likely not have it renewed if they had been found guilty of criminal activity in the country. Pailin also said that while foreigners applying for visas in Thailand do not undergo mandatory background checks, those who are found guilty of serious crimes are often blacklisted by the government and can be removed from the country.      BuzzFeed News      BuzzFeed News also spoke with Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, a Thai woman who is Unsworth’s longtime girlfriend. She said she had been with Unsworth for more than seven years and has posted numerous photos about their relationship on social media dating back several years. Unsworth, she added, spends part of the year in Thailand and part of the time in the UK.      Ratrawiphukkun, who said she is 40, declined to comment on Musk’s allegations against Unsworth, and referred a reporter to his lawyers. Among Musk’s other claims about Unsworth is that he was not part of the actual dive team in the Thailand cave rescue. While Unsworth did not dive for the mission, media reports and other people who were part of the rescue cited the Brit as instrumental to the effort, as he had previously mapped and explored some of the cave system and recruited some of the divers who went into the cave. “He may claim to know how to cave dive, but he wasn’t on the cave dive rescue team and most of the actual dive team refused to hang out with him,” Musk wrote in one email. In another email in which Musk wrote “on background” — BuzzFeed News again did not agree to these terms — the Tesla CEO said, “Never saw Unsworth at any point. Was told he was banned from the site.” A British diver on the rescue mission who had previously been in contact with Musk, Rick Stanton, denied those claims. “I've no idea what gave you those concerns about Vern,” Stanton wrote over Facebook Messenger. “They are completely unfounded. He was never kicked off site by anyone and worked continuously on the rescue for the full duration. He was pivotal to the entire operation.” Two Australian specialists who were brought in by the Thai government to aid the Thai cave rescue operation, Richard Harris and Craig Challen, also rejected Musk’s allegation. “Vern seemed like an excellent guy and absolutely vital to the mission,” said Harris, who, with Challen, helped in the sedation of the Thai boys before they were brought out of the cave by the British divers. “You must be confusing him with someone else.” “He was pivotal with his knowledge of the cave. [The] rescue wouldn’t have happened without him recommending the Brits were called,” Harris said. Photos and videos posted on Facebook by Woranan and members of the local Thai news media show Unsworth at the site through the duration of the operation, which lasted more than two weeks in the country’s Chiang Rai province. Some of those photos show Unsworth posing with other British members involved with the rescue. In his second email to BuzzFeed News, Musk commented on Unsworth’s interview with CNN. “Unsworth also said I was asked to leave by the Thai govt, which is utterly false. Thai Prime Minister thanked me personally per attached docs. I went all the way to area 3 with the Thai SEAL team, who were awesome.” Unsworth did say that Musk was asked to leave the cave in the interview, but did not specify who had asked him. Musk also supplied a letter to BuzzFeed News from the Thai prime minister thanking him for his team’s involvement in the rescue. “I wish to convey my deep appreciation to you and your engineering team for your expeditious and extraordinary efforts in constructing the Space-X mini-submarine 'Wild Boar' to assist the rescue operation of the Moo Pa Academy Football team trapped in Tham Luang Cave, Chiang Rai province,” wrote General Prayut Chan-o-cha.      Elon Musk provided to BuzzFeed News      In addition, Musk claimed that the mini-sub, which ultimately was not used in the rescue, was built to Stanton’s specifications, and that it was not deployed only because too much water had been drained from the cave. Stanton, however, denied that was the reason, and said he did not recall providing exact specifications to Musk.      “We didn't use the tube because rescue operations were already well underway and it didn't have the necessary life support systems,” Stanton said to BuzzFeed News on Facebook Messenger. “Essentially, it wasn't developed enough. I do think it has promise in certain situations and I hope they keep working on it to get it in shape for evaluation and to be considered as a viable alternative in future underwater rescue scenarios.” In another claim, Musk noted that “the alleged threat of a lawsuit” from Unsworth “magically appeared when I raised the issue” on Twitter last week and that nothing had been sent prior to his outburst. L. Lin Wood, Unsworth’s lawyer, provided BuzzFeed News with confirmation showing that he had sent a note titled “Fwd: Defamation of Vernon Unsworth” containing the legal letter to the appropriate email address for Musk’s office at SpaceX on Aug. 6. BuzzFeed News corresponded with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO at a separate, personal email address that two sources confirmed belonged to Musk. One source, who had previously worked for Musk, noted that the email address can be accessed by the billionaire and his assistants. The source noted that it was not uncommon for Musk to personally respond to reporters and other people through that account. Wood did not respond to questions asking him to more specifically address each of Musk’s accusations, but suggested that he was moving closer to legal action. “Today the rich and powerful seem all too ready to tweet falsities in the hope and expectation that their wealth and position will protect them,” he wrote in a statement. “Pedophilia is too serious an issue to leave unchallenged. If Mr. Musk believes his wealth affords him protection from his lies and Twibels, he is sadly mistaken.” Here are the emails Elon Musk sent to BuzzFeed News reporter Ryan Mac From: Elon Musk < redacted > Date: Thu, Aug 30, 2018 at 6:43 PM Subject: RE: BuzzFeed News: Unsworth legal letter To: \\"ryan.mac@buzzfeed.com\\"      Off the record      I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.

Was told he was banned from the site.      It is also total bs that the mini-sub wouldn’t fit through the caves. It was designed and built to specifications provided to me directly by Stanton and the actual dive team. The only reason it wasn’t used was that they were able to drain almost all the water out of the caves, so the underwater portion was very short, and the monsoon arrived later than expected.      Those pumps were critical. Some of the Tesla team helped with electrical power, but major credit to whoever provided those pumps. They were amazing. I’m told they were from some company in India.       ||||| Summary:","output":"Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, renewed attacks on British diver Vernon Unsworth, accusing him without evidence of being a \\"child rapist\\" and leaving Thailand with a \\"child bride\\", in an email sent to a reporter from BuzzFeed.

One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \\"provider\\" and purchaser or \\"consumer\\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \\"next Wednesday\\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \\"consumer\\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \\"power center\\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the... The author is most probably leading up to   _  .

German:","output":"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem und sucht stets nach neuen Partnern mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten, um als einzelne Franchisenehmer in Deutschland und als Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit zu agieren. Step-by-step explanation: 1. First, I translated \\"Kieser Training is a franchise system\\" to \\"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem\\" since this is a proper noun and \\"Franchise system\\" is simply \\"Franchisesystem\\" in German. 2. I translated \\"always looking for\\" to \\"stets nach\\" to convey the constant search for new partners. 3. I translated \\"new partners\\" to \\"neuen Partnern\\". In German, \\"new\\" becomes \\"neuen\\", and \\"partners\\" is \\"Partnern\\". 4. I translated \\"with entrepreneurial skills\\" to \\"mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten\\". In German, \\"with\\" is \\"mit\\", \\"entrepreneurial\\" becomes \\"unternehmerischen\\", and \\"skills\\" is \\"Fähigkeiten.\\" 5.

I translated \\"single franchisees\\" to \\"einzelne Franchisenehmer\\" which means \\"individual franchisees.\\" In German, \\"single\\" becomes \\"einzelne\\", and \\"franchisees\\" is \\"Franchisenehmer\\". 7.

Lastly, I translated \\"master franchisees worldwide\\" to \\"Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit\\".

Answer:","output":"The West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories in the Middle East that are inhabited predominantly by Palestinians and have been subject to varying degrees of Israeli control. Step 1: Identify West Bank The West Bank, named for its location west of the Jordan River, is a landlocked territory bordered by Israel to the west, north, and south and Jordan to the east. This territory has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967, although varying levels of self-administration have been granted to the Palestinian Authority. It is home to both Palestinian Arabs and Israeli settlers. The status and boundaries of the West Bank are a central issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Palestinians claiming it as part of a future independent state and Israelis arguing about different solutions. Step 2: Identify Gaza Strip The Gaza Strip is a small, densely populated coastal territory bordered by Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Like the West Bank, it has been subject to Israeli control since 1967, although it has been governed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas since 2007. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 but maintains control over the territory's airspace, territorial waters and border crossings (excluding the land border with Egypt, which is controlled by Egypt). The Gaza Strip has been a frequent flashpoint of violence between Israel and Hamas. Step 3: Summarize In summary, the West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories of geopolitical importance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both have been subject to Israeli control since 1967, though they are inhabited primarily by Palestinians who seek to establish an independent state in these territories. Israel maintains different degrees of control and restriction over the territories and continues to be involved in territorial disputes concerning these regions."},{"instruction":"Ray Trickett -  Ray Trickett is a British actor.

It was established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.  - Allhallowtide, Hallowtide, Allsaintstide, or the Hallowmas season, is the triduum encompassing the Western Christian observances of All Saints' Eve (Halloween), All Saints' Day (All Hallows') and All Souls' Day, which last from October 31 to November 2 annually. Allhallowtide is a \\"time to remember the dead, including martyrs, saints, and all faithful departed Christians.\\" The present date of Hallowmas (All Saints' Day) and thus also of its vigil (Hallowe'en) was established for Rome perhaps by Pope Gregory III (731741) and was made of obligation throughout the Frankish Empire by Louis the Pious in 835. Elsewhere, other dates were observed even later, with the date in Ireland being 20 April.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Piano is a 1993 New Zealand drama film about a mute piano player and her daughter.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (; 27 January 1832 - 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon, and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle Skeffington Lutwidge, and later of his Oxford friend Reginald Southey. He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.  A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing. Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees. His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.  He also found photography to be a useful entree into higher social circles. During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as John Everett Millais, Ellen Terry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Julia Margaret Cameron, Michael Faraday, Lord Salisbury, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming. He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly. Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced. What is this?","output":"Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, also known as Lewis Carroll, was a famous English writer, who wrote a popular story called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He was also good at math, logic, and taking pictures with a camera. He really enjoyed taking photos of people, especially kids, but always made sure a parent was there when he took pictures. He took many pictures in his lifetime but stopped in 1880 because it took too much time. People liked his photos, but as time passed, their taste in art changed, and his photography became less popular."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"If air is cleared in the lung and a smaller amount of oxygen is being delivered to the bloodstream as a result of the perturbation, this would have an effect on the overall respiratory process. The primary function of the lungs is to provide oxygen to the bloodstream while removing carbon dioxide. When there is a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream due to the perturbation, the body's cells receive less oxygen. This can directly lead to a lower overall oxygen concentration in the blood, known as hypoxemia. Indirectly, this can impact the respiratory process by triggering various physiological responses to compensate for the low oxygen levels. These may include: 1. Increased breathing rate: The body may attempt to increase the rate of breathing to take in more oxygen and exhale more carbon dioxide, leading to faster or deeper breaths. 2. Increased heart rate: To compensate for the lower oxygen levels in the blood, the heart may pump blood faster to try to distribute the available oxygen to the body's cells more rapidly. 3. Reduced energy production: As cells receive less oxygen, they may produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced physical activity. Therefore, due to the perturbation of air clearance in the lung and resulting in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, there is a direct effect on the respiratory process, which can have additional indirect effects on various physiological systems as the body tries to adapt to the change in oxygen levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.  After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword?\\" would be William.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: MEXICO CITY, Oct 29 - Mexico's central bank on Thursday said it sold 200 million of 200 million offered in an auction after the peso weakened sharply from its fix rate in the previous session. The central bank sold the dollars at an average weighted price of 16.6276 pesos per dollar. An auction is triggerd when the currency is trading 1 percent weaker than its fix rate in the previous session. The peso slumped from the fix rate seen on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested it could raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle) Choose from: 1). Yes. 2). It's impossible to say. 3). No. Hypothesis: The previous session's fixed rate was higher than the currency trading","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is true, let's unpack the information provided in the paragraph step by step: 1. The central bank sold 200 million because the peso weakened sharply from its fix rate in the previous session. 2. An auction is triggered when the currency is trading 1 percent weaker than its fix rate in the previous session. 3. The peso slumped from the fix rate seen on Wednesday (which was the previous session) after the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested raising interest rates in December. Since an auction is triggered when the currency is trading 1 percent weaker than its fix rate in the previous session, and the central bank did sell 200 million, we can infer that the peso was trading 1 percent weaker in the current session compared to the previous session.  However, the hypothesis states that the previous session's fixed rate was higher than the currency trading. The information in the paragraph only tells us that the peso weakened compared to the previous session's fix rate, but it does not provide enough information to compare the previous session's fix rate and the current trading rate of the currency.

In this case, the options are: desk drawer, schools, pencil box, principal, and office supply store. Step 2: Eliminate any irrelevant options. In this case, we can eliminate \\"principal\\" because a school principal is not a place to obtain an eraser, but a person who oversees the school. Step 3: Consider the convenience of the remaining options. Going to a school or an office supply store to obtain an eraser might be a little time-consuming as it involves travel and possibly purchasing the item. Step 4: Evaluate the likelihood of finding an eraser in the remaining options. Desk drawers and pencil boxes are both common places where office supplies, such as erasers, are kept. Step 5: Choose the option that is most likely to yield an eraser without any unnecessary hassle. Between a desk drawer and a pencil box, the pencil box is specifically designed to hold writing instruments and related accessories, making it the most likely place to find an eraser.

In the city Health Department's recent survey of school children's heights and weights, researchers found 31% of Hispanic children were obese, compared with 23% of African-American children, 16% of white children and 14% of Asian children. \\"This is mirroring trends we're seeing nationally,\\" said Lorna Thorpe, an epidemiologist who worked on the study. The variances between different groups of children and the obesity rate are driven by a wide range of factors, including culture and diet, experts said. Latino children might have more trouble with their weight if their diets are heavy on high-carbohydrate foods like rice and beans, said Melissa Forzano, program director of the Center for Weight Management at North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System. And in poorer neighborhoods, an overreliance on fast food like pizza, burgers and fries can cause kids to pack on the pounds, she said - particularly if combined with a sedentary lifestyle. Another piece of the fat puzzle, Forzano said, is genetics - and that can be frustrating for children who don't understand why they eat the same junk as their best friends but are much heavier. How children and their families view food also is crucial. \\"Is the child using food to cope with emotions? \\" she asked. \\"Is the child being taught that food is the way to deal with things when you're sad or having a bad day? \\" Patience is important with childhood obesity, Forzano said. Some heavy children will eventually slim down as they get taller. In youngsters, \\"We emphasize not so much losing weight, but stabilizing weight,\\" she said. In some cases, Forzano said, \\"They will grow into it. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about how Latino kids have a bigger problem with being overweight compared to kids from other backgrounds. They found that 31% of Hispanic children were obese. The reasons for this could be because of what they eat, like lots of rice and beans, or eating fast food. Another reason could be that some kids have genes that make them gain weight more easily. The article also talks about how kids and families think about food, like using it to feel better when sad. Lastly, it says that sometimes kids will become less heavy as they grow taller, and the goal for young kids should be to keep their weight the same instead of losing weight quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration. Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part. The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment. The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes. Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent. Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: \\"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\\" Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \\"praying\\" that the punishments \\"will have the desired effect\\". She said: \\"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.\\" The punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten. And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.

Human rights groups and the National Commission for Women have criticized these laws, calling for annual evaluations to assess their effectiveness as a deterrent. Despite the controversy, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, Dr. Yohana Susana Yembise, expressed hope that the punishments will have the desired effect, and that they are now part of the law and should be supported.

In between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, \\"Der Todesking\\" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of Sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. There's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. Entirely unlike I expected, \\"Der Todesking\\" isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! On the contrary actually, I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names, ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism, but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema.

Tabarez was full of praise for Cavani, who succeeded in suffocating Gerrard's usually influential midfield role and thwarting his ability to create goal-scoring opportunities for his teammates. Uruguay took the lead in the 39th minute when Luis Suarez latched onto Cavani's precise cross to head home past England keeper Joe Hart. However, England fought back and leveled the score in the 75th minute with a well-worked team goal, finished off by Wayne Rooney, his first ever goal in a World Cup tournament. The match seemed destined to end in a draw, but Suarez rose to the occasion again in the 85th minute. Capitalizing on a mistake in the England defense, the Liverpool striker fired home a powerful shot, effectively securing Uruguay's victory and putting England's World Cup dreams in jeopardy. Post-match, Tabarez was keen to heap praise on his forward Cavani, not just for his role in setting up Suarez's opening goal, but also for his tireless effort in denying Steven Gerrard any space in midfield. By disrupting Gerrard's rhythm, Cavani forced England to rely on alternative methods of attack, which the Uruguay defense effectively stifled. England manager Roy Hodgson, however, remained defiant in defeat. Speaking in a post-match interview, he insisted that his team had not performed poorly and that they could still qualify for the knockout stages with a victory against Costa Rica in their final group game, provided other results went their way. Unfortunately for England, their hopes were dashed when Costa Rica went on to beat Italy the following day, ensuring the Central American team's progression to the knockout stages, along with Uruguay. England ultimately finished bottom of Group D after a goalless draw against Costa Rica, a bitterly disappointing end to their World Cup campaign. In the aftermath of the tournament, English fans and pundits alike pondered what might have been, mostly questioning the tactics employed by Hodgson, the performance of their experienced players, and the team's inability to cope with the defensive efforts of opponents such as Cavani. Meanwhile, Uruguay and their coach Tabarez celebrated their progress to the knockout stages, fueled by the brilliance of Luis Suarez, the work rate of Edinson Cavani, and a determined team effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jefferson Reed is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by  Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis.

How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette.

Context: During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente. Question: How many countries were part of the Holy alliance in 1815? Answer:","output":"Three countries were part of the Holy Alliance in 1815.

South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program.

A:","output":"Fissures Gold deposits are most commonly found in cracks and fissures in igneous rocks. These cracks and fissures form as a result of igneous intrusion, where hot, molten rock (magma) rises from deep within the Earth, forcing its way into surrounding rock layers. As the magma cools and solidifies, it creates a network of cracks and fissures that can become filled with mineral-rich fluids. Over time, these fluids deposit minerals, including gold, into the fissures. The formation of gold deposits in this manner is called hydrothermal mineralization. The hydrothermal fluids responsible for depositing gold are rich in dissolved metals, sulfur, and other elements. As these fluids move through the cracks and fissures in the igneous rocks, they can come into contact with cooler rock formations, leading to the precipitation of minerals – including gold – within the fractures. Other answer choices listed are either incorrect or insufficient in explaining where gold deposits are found: - In sediment: While gold can be found in sedimentary rocks, it is generally not the primary source of gold deposits. Gold-bearing sedimentary deposits are formed through the weathering and transportation of gold from its original source in igneous rocks. - Kalenchoes: Kalenchoes are a genus of succulent plants and have no connection to gold deposits. - Rocks: This answer is too vague, as gold can be found in various types of rocks – primarily igneous, as mentioned previously. - Mines: While gold can be extracted from mines, it is not the natural geological source of gold deposits. - Coral reefs: Coral reefs are marine ecosystems built primarily by coral polyps and have no direct link to gold deposits. - Inactive: This term does not provide a clear context for the location of gold deposits. - Calcite: Calcite is a common calcium carbonate mineral found in sedimentary rocks and has no direct connection to gold deposits. In conclusion, out of the given answer choices, \\"fissures\\" is the most accurate answer, as gold ore deposits most commonly occur in cracks and fissures within igneous rocks, created and filled by hydrothermal fluids through igneous intrusion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Full Circle Context: As Julia Lofting (Mia Farrow) eats breakfast with her family, her daughter Kate (Sophie Ward) begins to choke on her food. Unable to dislodge the food, Julia attempts to save her by performing a tracheotomy which results in the child's bleeding to death. Julia leaves her husband Magnus (Keir Dullea) and moves to a new house with an upstairs room containing a child's possessions, including a mechanical clown toy with sharp cymbals on which she cuts her finger.

Unusual things happen to take place in the house such as strange noises and appliances turning on by themselves. Later, Julia again sees the girl in the park and finds a mutilated turtle and knife where she stood. Julia lets Magnus' sister Lily use her house to conduct a seance. Mrs. Flood, the medium, explains that spirits need to control someone to carry out physical acts. During the seance, the medium becomes frightened and tells Julia to leave the house immediately. Moments later, one of Lily's friends falls down the stairs before Mrs. Flood can explain what she saw. While Julia is out, Magnus breaks into her house.

On the positive side, the reviewer commends the quality of the food, stating that it is \\"good\\" and \\"worth waiting for.\\" This indicates that they appreciate the taste and overall dining experience provided by the restaurant. This part of the review could potentially attract potential customers who are looking for good food and may be willing to compromise on service time to taste the delicious offerings. On the negative side, however, the reviewer emphasizes the long waiting times they experienced for both the food and the check. They use repetition of \\"waiting\\" and the phrase \\"wait & wait\\" to emphasize their frustration with the service. The sentiment expressed in this part of the review is clearly negative, as it highlights a potential area of improvement for the restaurant in terms of efficiency and customer service.

Stephen Arthur Stills (born January 3, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Beginning his professional career with Buffalo Springfield, he composed one of their few hits \\"For What It's Worth,\\" which became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills was involved with the musician Judy Collins from 1968 to 1969 and wrote the song \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. He dated actress and singer-songwriter Nancy Priddy who was the inspiration for his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Pretty Girl Why\\". He also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash, which apparently led to the initial breakup of CSN, in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, the singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. They divorced in 1979. In 1976, Stills told Rolling Stone, \\"My hearing has gotten to be a terrible problem. If I keep playing and touring the way I have been, I'll go deaf.\\" In 1988, he married the Thai model Pamela Anne Jordan, with whom he had a daughter, Eleanor. His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996.  Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome  and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland.  Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years.  The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character. The character also plays an acoustic guitar and sings, and is often portrayed wearing the kind of western shirts that is part of Stills's standard wardrobe. The series also has a reference to Stills's collaborator Neil Young in the character of Young Neil.

The band plays a significant role in setting the atmosphere for the iconic vampire bar known as the Titty Twister. Tito & Tarantula is led by Tito Larriva, a talented musician and actor who is featured in the film as the band's frontman and also appears in other films by Robert Rodriguez. The band performs the catchy, Latin-rock-infused songs \\"After Dark\\" and \\"Angry Cockroaches\\" during the movie, which have become synonymous with the film itself. It is worth mentioning that Tito & Tarantula is not only a fictional band created for the film but also exists as a real-life band. They were formed in 1992 by Tito Larriva and released various albums like \\"Tarantism\\" (1997), \\"Hungry Sally & Other Killer Lullabies\\" (1998), \\"Little Bitch\\" (2000), \\"Andalucia\\" (2002), \\"Back Into the Darkness\\" (2008), and \\"Lost Tarantism\\" (2015).

It is a common term used in Finland to refer to a particular type of food product.  In particular, \\"Kebakko\\" is a Finnish food that can be closely compared to \\"kebab\\", a well-known dish of Middle Eastern origin. In Finland, this term has been adapted to become \\"Kebakko\\". This is in line with the typical Finnish practice of incorporating international dishes into their cuisine and giving them a uniquely Finnish twist, which is often reflected in the name as well.  \\"Kebakko\\" is essentially a form of processed meat product. It usually consists of a mixture of various types of meat, which may include beef, pork, or poultry. This meat mixture is typically seasoned with a variety of spices to give it a distinctive, robust flavor. It is often shaped into sticks or patties which are then grilled or fried. The term \\"Kebakko\\" is a portmanteau of two Finnish words: \\"Kebab\\" which refers to the Middle-Eastern dish, and \\"Makkara\\" which means sausage in Finnish. This indicates its nature as a combination between the two food types, reflecting its unique position in Finnish cuisine.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ's toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm.

Detectives investigating Savile said. last week they had drawn up an arrest list of people who could be. questioned about allegations made by victims of Savile or his alleged. accomplices. A Scotland Yard spokesman. said this evening: 'The man. arrested yesterday, November 1, in connection with Operation Yewtree -. Yewtree 2 - returned on bail today and was interviewed. 'He has been re-bailed to a date in December.' Police earlier said he had been arrested 'on suspicion of sexual offences'. A spokesman. said the suspect was released on bail for the first timebetween 1am and 1.30am this. morning. Freddie Starr was driven away from his home in Studley, Warwickshire today by fiancee Sophie Lea. Police searched Starr's garage at his Warwickshire home yesterday after his arrest by detectives investigating allegations of sexual offences connected to Jimmy Savile. Denial: Freddie Starr, 69, recently on ITV's This Morning appeared alongside girlfriend Sophie Lea, 34, to deny he had any involvement in the scandal. Starr said a week ago that he was. prepared to speak to police about the allegations to clear his name. He. said: ‘Ask me anything – anything. I’ll be interviewed by any police. force.’ He has repeatedly denied claims that. he groped Miss Ward. Appearing on ITV News with his 34-year-old fiancee. Sophie Lea, Starr insisted he had never abused underage girls, and said. he had hired private detectives to prove his innocence. He initially denied ever meeting his. accuser, or appearing with her on Savile’s 1974 BBC show Clunk Click,. but footage later emerged showing him and Miss Ward in the same shot. Miss Ward has claimed: ‘I was. horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad. attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him. because he smelled like my stepfather and it frightened me and freaked. me out, and I rebuffed him.’ Standing guard: Police officers outside Freddie Starr's home. Freddie Starr has been arrested by detectives investigating allegations of sexual offences connected to Jimmy Savile. A car drives through the gates to Freddie Starr's home as police officers stand outside. It prompted Starr to seek an. injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court. application was rejected. He later invited reporters into his home and. told them the woman was ‘a nutter’ and accused her of ‘picking my name. out of a hat’. He said: ‘I’ve never touched an underage girl in my. life.’ PR guru Max Clifford has claimed. dozens of big-name stars from the 1960s and 1970s have contacted him. because they are ‘frightened’ they will become implicated in the. widening child abuse scandal. Appearing on Daybreak this morning,. Mr Clifford said a lot of old stars were worried about being dragged. into the investigation because they had appeared on Top Of The Pops or. Jim'll Fix It and merely posed for photographs with girls and Savile. Starr is the second celebrity to be arrested after Gary Glitter was questioned for 10 hours last Sunday on suspicion of committing sexual offences. Starr has previously denied claims by Karin Ward (above) that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl. Freddie Starr as Jimmy Savile in 1974 impressions show, Who Do You Do. He told the programme: 'It is a situation which could easily turn into a witch hunt, a lot of big stars are frightened. Where is it going to end?' 'I hope they (the police) concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who were manipulating girls.' Starrs release this evening came as solicitor Liz Dux said Savile's estate, the BBC and three hospitals - Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor - are facing possible legal action by alleged victims. Ms Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said formal notice had been sent to 'all interested parties' of an intention to pursue claims against them. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.' Savile, who died last year aged 84,. has been described as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British. history. Police are following more than 400 leads into the DJ, who left. at least 300 victims over a four-decade rampage of child abuse. Miss Ward was one of several pupils. from Duncroft Approved School in Surrey who were invited to the BBC by. Savile to watch his shows being recorded. In 2007, Surrey Police investigated. historic complaints from former pupils of the now-defunct school, but. the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was not enough evidence to. bring charges. Savile's estate, reportedly worth £4.3 million, has been frozen in response to the mounting allegations. Lawyers are also looking into the late presenter's overseas assets, thought to be administered from tax haven the Channel Islands. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, yesterday revealed the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims. Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times (FT). The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document, which instructs that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's friends, family and neighbours. It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people. The remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by NatWest on behalf of the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, according to the FT. Savile's intended individual beneficiaries include the trustees of both his charities and existing and former employees of Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, the newspaper added. Savile's relatives said they do not want a penny of his estate and called for the cash to be donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. The late presenter's nephew, Guy Marsden, 58, said his uncle was 'a monster' and it was only right that the money should be given to a police-run anti-paedophile unit, and Savile's victims. Savile's victims are to sue the star's estate to get answers and compensation, and to 'move on with their lives', a lawyer said yesterday. Liz Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said some had not been able to form adult relationships since the attacks. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.' A solicitor representing alleged victims of Savile said lawyers are also looking into the late presenter's overseas assets, thought to be administered from tax haven the Channel Islands.

After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. Caiaphas brings Jesus before...

Deep in space, above a fiery planet named Dante, orbits the space station called \\"Dante 01\\". It hosts a psychiatric detention center that currently hosts six prisoners whose crimes were so severe that they volunteered to live under experimentation. The center is owned by a pharmaceutical company called Neurinos and directed by a man named Charon, with the assistance of psychiatrist Dr. PersÃ©phone and two security guards called CR and BR.One day, a Neurinos shuttle arrives with a new scientist named Elisa, carrying a new prisoner of unknown origins who was found as the sole survivor in a shipwreck and wakes up from the hypersleep severely disoriented and unable to speak. He is introduced to the other inmates: their leader CÃ©sar; his right-hand man Lazare, who developed the ability to hold his breath to escape the gas with which the prisoners are sedated; the large and violent Moloch, who's CÃ©sar's enforcer; the reclusive Bouddha, who has the habit of trying and murdering whoever is in pain out of misguided compassion; the deranged anarchist hacker Attila; and Raspoutine, a deeply religious man who claims the new one was sent by God to save them, and starts calling him \\"Saint-Georges, the Dragonslayer\\", because of a tattoo on his arm.Elisa and PersÃ©phone are at odds over their research methods, since the latter advocates a humanist approach to the prisoners' mental issues, while Elisa has been sent there to experiment with a new nanotechnology that directly modifies the patient's DNA, eliminating the genetic component of their antisocial behaviors. Charon asks Attila to hack into Elisa's files to find out the extent of her orders. Much to his horror, Attila finds out she's authorized to kill them all for the sake of her research.As expected, Bouddha attempts to strangle Saint-Georges in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the prisoners, so they get gassed, and Bouddha becomes Elisa's first subject. She injects him with nanites and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha is immediately wracked by unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA, but Saint-Georges is somehow able to remove them from him (from his point of view, he's removing some kind of energy creature from Bouddha and eating it), so Bouddha becomes well again and as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker, so he befriends him, swearing to protect him from the others. Later, Moloch attacks Saint-Georges, but Raspoutine inserts himself, causing Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat with the shiv he was holding. Gas pours in to knock the group out again, but not before Saint-Georges had run over to assist Moloch. The prison guards rush in only to discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well. On their way out, they inject CÃ©sar with the nanites.PersÃ©phone's assumption that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's own doubts prompt an increasingly debilitated CÃ©sar to fear an impending usurping of his authority, so he commands Lazare and Moloch to get rid of Saint-Georges. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, Saint-Georges is stabbed to death by Lazare. However, while the staff is examining his corpse, Saint-Georges wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her.CÃ©sar is now in severe pain from the nanites, but Saint-Georges cures him as well. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into the planet, triggering the rage of the other prisoners. Attila manages to runs away, only to be found later in a shaft, having hanged himself.With Attila dead, the only way to save the station is to activate the manual override located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree to let the staff through, but Elisa refuses to accompany the others inside the prisoner area. As all the station inhabitants work together to open the hatch, the gas goes off, knocking everyone but Lazare out.Elisa prepares to escape via shuttle, but Lazare ambushes her, forcing her to let him in the shuttle as well. As the others awaken, one of the guard finds out about Elisa's betrayal, but also that Attila had messed with the shuttle controls as well, resulting in the shuttle burning through the planet's atmosphere. After having finally opened the hatch, the group finds the cooling system overheated so now the corridor that leads to the manual controls is filled with boiling water. CÃ©sar realizes he is the only one short enough to fit into the little space, and volunteers to descend, wrapped in some protective fabrics. He emerges on the other side horribly burned and dies in the compartment before being able to entering the code necessary to reset the controls.In the epilogue, PersÃ©phone's narration recounts how Saint-Georges fulfilled his destiny by slaying the \\"dragon\\". We see him emerge from the station in a space suit and float above the planet, using the full extent of his inexplicable powers and the mysterious energy creatures that now reside inside him to terraform Dante into a livable planet, while his body disintegrates in space as a result of the transformation.","output":"Question: What is the name of the space station orbiting the planet Dante?

The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.","output":"In this case, the smaller balloon has higher air pressure. Since the particles of fluids, like the air inside a balloon, tend to move from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, the smaller balloon will have more air particles crowded together in a smaller space. This results in more collisions among particles and against the inner walls of the balloon, leading to higher pressure compared to the larger balloon. The larger balloon, having more volume, allows the air particles to spread out more, resulting in a lower pressure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow.  - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\".  - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species :  - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous.    What is the relationship between 'petrochelidon' and 'hirundinidae'? The answer is:","output":"Petrochelidon is a genus of birds within the family Hirundinidae. The relationship between Petrochelidon and Hirundinidae is that Petrochelidon is a subset of the larger family Hirundinidae. This means that the birds belonging to the Petrochelidon genus also belong to the family Hirundinidae, sharing common characteristics and adaptations for aerial feeding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Bornholm disease or epidemic pleurodynia or epidemic myalgia is a disease caused by the Coxsackie B virus or other viruses . It is named after the Danish island of Bornholm where early cases occurred .  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Myocarditis, also known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest. Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram (ECG), increased troponin, heart MRI, and occasionally a heart biopsy. An ultrasound of the heart is important to rule out other potential causes such as heart valve problems. Treatment depends on both the severity and the cause. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics are often used. A period of no exercise is typically recommended during recovery. Corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be useful in certain cases. In severe cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator or heart transplant may be recommended. In 2013, about 1.5 million cases of acute myocarditis occurred. While people of all ages are affected, the young are most often affected. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most cases are mild. In 2015 cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990. The initial descriptions of the condition are from the mid-1800s.  - Pathology (from the Greek roots of \\"pathos\\", meaning \\"experience\\" or \\"suffering\\", and \\"-logia\\", \\"study of\\") is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis.  - Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones.  - Coxsackie B is a group of six serotypes of Coxsackievirus, a pathogenic enterovirus, that trigger illness ranging from mild gastrointestinal distress to full-fledged pericarditis and myocarditis (Coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy).   - Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the heart). Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain. The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse with lying down or breathing deep. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. The cause of pericarditis is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include a heart attack. Treatment in most cases is with NSAIDs and possibly colchicine. Steroids may be used if those are not appropriate. Typically symptoms improve in a few days to weeks but can occasionally last months. Complications can include cardiac tamponade, myocarditis, and constrictive pericarditis. It is a less common cause of chest pain. About 3 per 10,000 people are affected per year. Those most commonly affected are males between the ages of 20 and 50. Up to 30% of those affected have more than one episode. Signs and symptoms. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom portion of scapula on the back), which is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or supine position) or inspiration (taking a breath in), is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain may resemble the pain of angina pectoris or heart attack, but differs in that pain changes with body position, as opposed to heart attack pain that is pressure-like, and constant with radiation to the left arm and/or the jaw. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue,...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can apply lemon juice to help lighten dark areas of your ringworm scar. Vitamin C is an important nutrient for normal wound healing, so it might help to minimize the appearance of a scar when applied to the skin as well.  To apply lemon juice, soak a cotton swab in lemon juice and apply the lemon juice directly to the ringworm scar. Let the lemon juice dry and then rinse it away with some warm water. You can apply lemon juice to a ringworm scar once per day. You can also massage aloe vera gel into a ringworm scar to help soften the tissue. Aloe vera works well on burn scars, so it might help to improve other types of scars as well. To use aloe vera gel, smooth a small amount over your ringworm scar and leave it on. Do this a few times per day. Applying a steeped green tea bag to a scar may also help to minimize scarring and discoloration due to ringworm. Green tea may help with scars due to its antioxidant properties.  To use green tea as a treatment for a ringworm scar, steep a bag of green tea in hot water for about three minutes. Remove the teabag from the water and squeeze some of the excess water from the bag. Then, apply the tea bag to the ringworm scar and hold it there for about 10 to 15 minutes. Repeat this process three to four times per day. You can also mix St John’s wort oil with castor oil and massage it into a ringworm scar. St John’s wort oil has been shown to promote C-section wound healing, so it may help with other types of scars as well.  To use St. John’s wort oil, place two to three drops of the oil in two tablespoons of castor oil and stir the oils together until they are combined. Then, use your fingers to massage the oil into the ringworm scar. Repeat this process two to three times daily. Honey may also help to reduce the size of scars and discolored areas because honey acts as a natural moisturizer. Manuka honey and Tualang honey are good choices for medicinal use, but you may have to go to a health food store or check online to find these types of honey.  To use honey on a ringworm scar, apply a thin layer of honey and then massage it into your skin for about five to 10 minutes. Leave the honey on the scar for about one hour. Rinse away the honey with warm water after time is up. If desired, you can cover the area in a thin gauze pad while you leave the honey on. Vitamin D oil has anti-inflammatory properties that seem to improve the appearance of surgical scars. Vitamin D has also been found effective for treating psoriasis, which indicates that it may benefit a more minor skin condition such as a ringworm scar.  Talk to your doctor or dermatologist before using vitamin D to see if this treatment is a good option for getting rid of your ringworm scars. If you decide to use vitamin D as a treatment for your ringworm scars, then break open one 2000 IU vitamin D capsule and mix it with four to five drops of castor oil. Then apply the mixture to your ringworm scar and massage it into your skin. Vitamin E is a well-known, popular treatment for scar healing, but some studies have indicated that vitamin E may not be an effective treatment for scars. In some cases, vitamin E has even caused the scar to look worse or resulted in negative skin reactions.  To be safe, check with your doctor or dermatologist before using vitamin E for your ringworm scars. If you decide to use vitamin E oil, try breaking open one 400 IU  vitamin E capsule and mix it with four to five drops of castor oil. Then, apply the mixture directly to your scar and massage it into your skin.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence?  The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Article: You need to inspect the wound once it stops bleeding. Get to the cleanest, safest area that you can. You don't want to risk infection from environmental contaminants. Examine the wound to figure out how deep it is. If it is less than 1cm, you do not need to seek outside medical help and you can continue to clean the wound on your own.  If it looks deeper than 1cm, you will need stitches, even if the blood stopped flowing. Reapply the pressure dressing and seek medical attention as soon as possible. If you have a large area of abrasion, which is greater than 12 cm by 12 cm, with a significant amount of particulate matter, seek medical attention as well so the area can be appropriately cleansed. That much debris will cause infection if not removed. This can be done by a doctor under local anesthesia.   If the wound is dirty or caused by something rusty and it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus shot, you will need a tetanus shot right away. Wounds can be misleading. Small wounds, such as puncture wounds, may seem small but they can be quite deep and are often full of bacteria. They also often become infected. This is particularly true of animal or human bites, so always seek medical attention for this kind of wound. Bacteria that live in the mouths of humans, cats, dogs, and other animals contain pasteurella and other virulent bacteria that can lead you from a small bite to the operating room within 24 hours.  This is also true of fight bites, which are incurred during a fist fight. When one individual hits another in the mouth and gets accidentally bitten by the others teeth, the wounds are also particularly prone to infection. A bite may need to be treated with prescription antibiotics to prevent infection. Make sure you go to the doctor or emergency room to deal with bites. If your wound does not need medical care, you can take care of it at home. Rinse the wound with warm water to remove the excess blood.  This may disrupt clotted blood and the wound may ooze or begin bleeding again. This is normal and shows that there is no significant vascular damage to contend with and the bleeding will stop again after cleansing. Once you rinse your wound of the initial blood, you can clean the wound. First, wash your hands with soap and hot water. This will help prevent contamination of the wound and help stop infection. Next, soak a gauze or clean cloth in a providone-Iodine solution such as Betadine. This will kill any bacteria that you will have encountered when your skin broke. Once you clean the wound with the solution, pat it dry with sterile gauze or a clean cloth.  If irrigation of the wound did not get out all of the debris in the wound, such as twigs, thorns, or pebbles, use tweezers to very carefully pull out the remaining debris. Do not probe the wound because you could injure yourself further. If you don't have any providone-Iodine solution, you can use any antiseptic wash that is used on open wounds. If you don't have any solution at all, you can rinse the wound out for an additional amount of time to ensure it is cleaned as well as possible. Once your wound has been adequately rinsed and cleaned, you need to bandage it to keep it protected. First, apply antibacterial ointment such as Neosporin to the wound with gauze, a cotton ball, or a Q-tip. Next, if your wound is small and superficial, use a band-aid to cover the wound. If it is larger, grab a fresh set of gauze and medical tape from your first aid kit. Place the gauze over the wound and secure the edges of the bandage with tape. This will keep debris out.  If you do not have gauze and medical tape, you need to purchase wound supplies at the drug store or pharmacy. The wound needs to be bandaged properly with sterile supplies in order to prevent infection. If the wound is over a flexible joint, buy rolled gauze to make it more easily managed and the bandage more secure. After your initial dressing, perform the cleansing and dressing ritual daily. When you are cleaning the wound, you need to look for signs of infection. These include redness at the wound edges, especially if the wound area expands from one day to the next, drainage or pus on the wound, and a fever. As long as no signs of infection present themselves, your wound should heal within a two to three week time frame. Lower extremity wounds or wounds on those who are obese  may take on the longer to heal.

During the pursuit, the dealer holds a child hostage. Tellis shoots and kills the dealer before he can hurt the child, however a stray bullet hits the child's pregnant mother, causing her to miscarry. Eighteen months later, the Detroit Police Department asks Tellis to investigate the murder of an undercover narcotics officer called Michael Calvess. Tellis is initially reluctant, as there is little else he can do for a living however, he reads the investigation files and agrees to take the case, on two conditions. The first: he will get a desk job if he secures a conviction. The second: he is partnered with detective Henry Oak (Ray Liotta), whom Tellis is aware of through reading the files on Calvess' death. Tellis' reason for wanting Oak is his opinion that the only useful evidence in the investigation came from him. The department chief informs Tellis of Oak's reputation as a driven and effective policeman, but also warns him about his instability. Despite his reservations, Oak is assigned to the case. The two build a rapport during a violent investigation. Oak is a dedicated but haunted cop who uses brutal force on criminals, who believes the department want the case buried. During the investigation, Oak reveals that his wife died of cancer, and they had no children. He recalls a drug bust decades prior, where he found a ten-year-old girl naked who was being sold for prostitution by her stepfather for rent money, resulting in Oak beating the man bloody. He sees parallels between that case and the current one. Meanwhile, Tellis' wife is worried for her husband's well-being. Tellis visits Calvess' widow Kathryn, and asks about her and her husband's relationship when he was on the street.

Given the below context:  Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island.

Do these questions have the same meaning? What is the best way for a beginner to learn a codebase? What is the best way for a beginner to learn programming?","output":"No, these two questions have different meanings. Although they are related to the same field, i.e., programming, the first question is focused on understanding a specific codebase, while the second question is concerned with learning programming in general. Let's break down each question to grasp their meanings more accurately: 1. What is the best way for a beginner to learn a codebase? This question is targeted at individuals who are just starting to familiarize themselves with a particular codebase. A codebase refers to the collection of source code files and related resources used to build a specific software application or program. Coming to terms with an existing codebase can be a challenging task even for experienced developers, as it may contain complex modules and interdependencies they need to understand. To learn a codebase effectively, beginners can follow these steps: a. Identify the programming language(s) and tools: Determine the primary programming languages and tools used in the project to help focus on acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge. b. Study the documentation: Read any existing documentation, such as README files, user guides, or developer documentation, to gain an overview of the software application and its purpose, components, and structure. c. Browse the code structure: Go through the project's file tree, familiarize yourself with the naming conventions and organization of files and folders, and take note of any unique characteristics. d. Run and interact with the application: If possible, build and execute the program to see how it works in practice. This will help you understand the application's functionality, user interface, and expected behavior. e. Start with simple tasks: Initially, work on small tasks or bug fixes to become comfortable with the development environment and coding styles. Gradually progress to more intricate tasks or feature additions as you gain confidence and understanding. f. Ask for help or guidance: Engage with other developers working on the project, ask for their advice or clarification on issues to gain insights, and become more knowledgeable about the project. 2. What is the best way for a beginner to learn programming? This question pertains to the overall process of learning programming for someone who is just starting to explore the field. Programming is a wide domain, encompassing diverse programming languages, paradigms, and tools. Here are some steps to help beginners learn programming effectively: a. Choose a programming language: Research popular programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++, and select one language as a starting point, based on personal interests, goals, or the specific domain you want to enter. b. Learn the basics: Begin by understanding the basic syntax, data types, control structures, and error handling in your chosen programming language. Study the core concepts and practice writing simple programs. c. Master programming fundamentals: Learn fundamental programming concepts, such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. These concepts apply to a wide range of programming languages and will improve your overall understanding. d. Work on projects: Start building projects, even small ones, to apply your skills and knowledge in a practical manner. This will enable you to understand real-world scenarios, problems and allow you to experiment with different coding approaches. e. Study from multiple resources: Utilize online courses, programming books, blogs, YouTube tutorials, and coding exercises to learn from multiple sources and perspectives. This will help you cement your knowledge and identify areas where you need improvement. f. Engage with the programming community: Join online forums, social media groups, or attend meetups dedicated to your chosen programming language or domain. Interact with other programmers, ask questions, and exchange ideas to enrich your learning experience. g. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace the fact that programming is a lifelong learning process. As you progress, keep exploring new tools, languages, and technologies to enhance your skills and adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape. In summary, the first question deals with learning a specific codebase, while the second question is about learning programming in general. While the best way to learn a codebase requires understanding the structure, documentation, and execution of a specific project, learning programming focuses on mastering programming languages, concepts, problem-solving, and practical applications through projects and community engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Q: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: Where is Camp Humphreys located? === The answer to the above question is Pick from: (A). not enough information (B). Somewhere in the United States. (C). Somewhere in South Korea. (D). Seoul. The answer is:","output":"(C). Somewhere in South Korea."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Any list of numbers we deal with will be enclosed in square brackets [] and separated by commas, such as: [1,2,3].  Here is a simple step-by-step explanation: 1. Understand the task:  The task wants us to remove all the even numbers from a given list. It is also explicitly mentioned that even if every number in our given list is even, we are to return an empty list. We should also recall that zero is considered as an even number. 2. Examine our example:  In the given example, [2, 195, 142, 141, 34, 34], we have a mix of both odd and even numbers. Notice also that some numbers may be repeated in the list, as in the case of 34. 3. Follow the guideline: We must isolate the odd numbers in the list, effectively deleting all even numbers.  4. Execute the task: (1) Look at each number in the list one-by-one. (2) Determine if a number is even or odd. Remember, if a number can be divided by 2 with no remainder, it's an even number. Otherwise, it's odd. (3) If the number is even, remove it from the list. If it's odd, leave it in the list. Following these simple steps, we would be left with the list [195, 141] as the even numbers 2, 142, 34, and 34 would have been removed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fort Davis is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jeff Davis County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,201 at the 2010 US Census . It is the county seat of Jeff Davis County. It was the site of Fort Davis established in 1854 on the San Antonio-El Paso Road through west Texas and named after Jefferson Davis, who was then the Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce. Can we infer the following? Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather","output":"To infer that Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather, we must first gather information about its weather conditions and examine if there is a correlation between the population size and the weather.  Step 1: Research the weather conditions of Fort Davis We would need to look into the climate, average temperatures, precipitation, and any extreme weather conditions in Fort Davis to see if there is a possible link to the population size. Step 2: Compare the weather with the population trend After gathering information on Fort Davis' weather, we would compare it with the population trend over time. If there is a clear decrease in population during adverse weather conditions or low population growth compared to similar regions with more favorable climate, it could indicate a relationship between weather and population size. Step 3: Analyze other factors that might affect the population size Before concluding that the small population is solely due to the weather, we must also consider other factors that could affect the population, such as economic opportunities, accessibility, and quality of life. We should compare these factors with the weather conditions in Fort Davis to see which one has a more significant impact on the population size. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the research and analysis conducted in the previous steps, we can then determine whether or not it is reasonable to infer that the small population in Fort Davis is primarily due to its weather conditions. We would need to see a strong correlation between adverse weather and the low population or a lack of other significant factors to confidently make this inference. Without analyzing the weather conditions and considering other potential factors, it is not possible to confidently infer that Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now researchers are reporting this week in the Hong Kong Medical Journal on the November 2010 case of a newborn girl thought to have two tumors in her abdomen that were found to be 8- to 10-week-old fetuses instead. Weighing half an ounce and a third of an ounce, they were far enough along to each have four limbs, a spine, a rib cage, intestines, and an anus, and to be connected through an umbilical cord to a single placenta-like mass. \\"Since it is impossible for the little girl to have conceived the pregnancy on her own, the fertilization of the twin fetuses, of course, belongs to her parents, which has gone to the wrong place,\\" a local doctor tells the South China Morning Post. The baby girl carrying the fetuses underwent successful surgery to remove them at just two weeks of age. The condition, called fetus in fetu, is thought to occur in 1 in 500,000 births worldwide. This was the second such case to be reported in the region. The World Health Organization has classified it as a type of cancer called mature teratoma, but researchers write \\"the theory of demised multiple pregnancy has gained much support recently. More evidence is needed to confirm either theory.\\" (Last year, doctors found a 44-year-old calcified fetus in an 84-year-old woman.) Expand this summary.","output":"Sometimes, really rarely, a baby can be born with something called \\"fetus in fetu.\\" It's like having tiny baby siblings inside their tummy, but they're not really alive. In these special cases, the tiny siblings don't grow the normal way, in their mommy's belly, but instead, they end up inside their brother or sister. It's so rare that it has only happened about 200 times. One time, in November 2010, doctors found what looked like two little siblings inside a newborn baby girl's tummy. They thought it could be tumors, but when they removed them, they saw that they were actually tiny fetuses, about 8 to 10 weeks old. They even had little arms and legs, and an umbilical cord connecting them. Since the baby girl couldn't have made these little sibling-fetuses herself, doctors think that they came from her mommy and daddy, and just ended up in the wrong place while they were growing. The baby girl had surgery to remove the tiny sibling-fetuses, and everything turned out okay. This kind of thing is so special that it only happens in about 1 in 500,000 births around the world.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

Despite the ensuing messiness typical of using such materials, the narrator does not mind getting dirty. There are several potential reasons behind the narrator's attitude, which can be deduced from the context: 1. Bonding experience: The fact that the narrator uses the phrases \\"for her,\\" \\"more work for me than for her,\\" and \\"we'll be breaking out\\" suggest that the activity involves a close relationship between the narrator and another individual, possibly a child. As a result, the process of creating the item could be viewed as an enjoyable bonding experience where the mess is worth the quality time spent together. 2. Appreciation for creativity: The narrator seems to have a penchant for expressing themselves artistically, given the multiple mentions of various crafting materials. The excitement in breaking out these materials reflects enthusiasm for creativity, exploration, and expression. This passion may outweigh any concern for messiness, particularly if the final product is a rewarding accomplishment. 3. Enjoyment in the process: Through phrases like \\"not that I mind\\" and \\"you all know how much I love,\\" the narrator reveals their affinity for these kinds of activities. They seem to derive joy from working with these materials, which may lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, dismissing any concerns about getting dirty in the process. 4. Unfazed by messiness: It is also possible that the narrator is simply unbothered by the mess that ensues from using these materials. They may have grown accustomed to the clutter, either as part of their everyday life or through repeated exposure to such situations. This familiarity could render the chaos insignificant when compared to the pleasure derived from the activity. In conclusion, the narrator does not mind getting dirty during the creation of this item due to the emotional and psychological benefits they experience. These may include bonding with their companion, enjoying their passion for creativity, and relishing the process of working with various materials. Furthermore, the narrator may find that their appreciation for the end product or for the hands-on experience outweighs any concerns about making a mess."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How Social Networks Are Fueling The Solar Boom This guest post was written by Ben Higgins, director of government affairs for REC Solar, a California-based solar installer. How many times have you tried a restaurant, band, movie or book because a friend recommended it? Word of mouth buzz is a marketer’s holy grail. After all, trusted friends and people who share commonalities are the most credible referrers–they have no ulterior motive, have many of the same needs, and generally seek to make us happy. Thanks to our seemingly infinite social networks, we are inundated with recommendations influencing our tastes and preferences from food to clothing brands. Social influence stronger in conversations with neighbors and good friends, which is beginning to extend from our desktops to our rooftop energy decisions in a new phenomenon I call “social solar.” U.S. solar companies are closely managing two radical shifts in market fundamentals. First, solar module prices have plummeted, driving a whopping 70% increase in installations in 2012 even as some high-cost manufacturers have been driven out of business. Second, as solar hardware costs decline, the ‘soft costs’ of government red tape have emerged as the top focus for cutting the price of solar farther. Yet solar’s growth very much depends on adoption by homeowners and businesses. Going solar is more complicated than switching broadband providers, requiring permitting, construction and often financing—and many property owners are unwilling to invest that effort without a strong belief that it’s worth the hassle. By learning about the benefits from solar power systems from a trusted peer who faces many of the same local challenges (utility, construction, permitting options, siting), research from Yale and New York University demonstrates that social solar has already been shown to boost adoption rates by close to a percentage point. Across thousands of incoming sales leads in an industry that installed more than 10 billion worth of solar last year on tight margins, that difference can make or break a business. First, the good news. Thanks in part to falling module prices, solar is today cost-competitive with retail electricity rates in at least 20 states. In many markets, solar can be the most affordable energy source available. Still, adoption lags behind what the often-attractive financial returns would indicate, indicating that consumer awareness about solar costs is woefully behind. Now the bad news: many Americans still view solar as a solution to environmental woes rather than high utility bills. A September Solar Energy Industries Association survey found that while 92% of Americans support solar, 66% believe it’s still too expensive. As a result, solar’s customer acquisition costs are extremely high – in extreme cases equal to the cost of the solar panels – as sales teams spend time and money educating potential customers. The industry is quickly learning that the best and most cost-effective sales channels are solar’s early adopters. Solar, after all, is often a highly visible addition to homes or property, a natural conversation piece that sparks interest from neighbors – much like renovating the garage, installing new landscaping or buying an electric car. These front lawn conversations are vital for spreading the word about the mechanics of installing solar power as well as the economic payoff, from a trusted peer who’s been there and can take solar from fanciful to real. While solar companies have used customer referral programs for over a decade, these programs are kicking into overdrive targeting potential customers in neighborhoods with recent installations, expanding customer referral programs and providing prominent signage paired with local PR and social media. The message? Your neighbors, customers and even competitors are saving money with solar under similar conditions as you – and we make it easy for you to join them. The positive impact can be seen at both retail and wholesale levels. Take, for instance, two virtually identical commercial systems built for neighboring cold-storage facilities in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Once the first customer shared information about the financial benefits – savings of more than 300,000 per year and a 20-year return of more than 14% – solar became an easy proposition for the neighbors. The benefits of social solar apply on a broader scale as well. Solar policy advocates note that even after state financial incentives for solar have declined precipitously in top-tier markets including Arizona and New Jersey, small-scale solar adoption continues to grow. Many factors are behind this growth, but paramount is that solar’s newfound visibility on homes and businesses drove consumer interest, conversations and acceptance. Consumer awareness isn’t solar’s only near-term challenge. Solar companies still face a labyrinth of local, state and federal policies and must continue to attract investment and reduce costs even further to open new markets. However, solar can take a cue from other successful technologies in putting people – not the product – first. Turning solar’s early-adopters into social solar-evangelists, and credibly communicating that solar is a smart choice for nearly everyone to generate their own power will make an enormous step towards building our country’s clean energy future. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the impact of social networks in the growth and acceptance of solar as an energy source, a phenomenon referred to as \\"social solar\\". The plunge in solar module prices resulted in a significant increase in installations, making this form of energy cost-competitive in many states. However, despite these benefits, many consumers are still unaware of the economic advantages of solar power. The article emphasizes the value of social influence in boosting solar adoption. As solar installations are very visible, they often spark curiosity and conversations among neighbors and friends. Trusted peers sharing positive experiences with solar power help raise awareness about its practicality and economic benefits.  Solar companies are magnifying this effect by strategically targeting potential customers in areas with new installations and enhancing their customer referral programs. These companies are using social media, signage, and local PR to convey the message that many are already benefiting from solar energy under similar conditions. Success stories of \\"social solar\\" are highlighted, such as commercial systems built for neighboring facilities in California, where the financial benefits shared by the first customer led to easy adoption by the neighbors. Influenced by real-life examples and direct benefits, consumer interest and acceptance of solar power has seen continuous growth even after reductions in financial incentives.  Though challenges like local regulations and the need to reduce costs remain, the article highlights the significance of turning early adopters into advocates for this sustainable energy source.

Please answer the following question: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision.  Are the coral reefs near Malarn more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan?  Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. Answer:","output":"To answer the question about the health of coral reefs near Malarn and Trainlan, let's first analyze the information provided. 1. Malarn regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. 2. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. 3. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America. 4. Various local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms are mentioned, but the specific locations of Malarn and Trainlan are not provided. Based on points 1 and 2, it can be inferred that the coral reefs near Malarn might be affected by the dust from the desert. However, without knowing the specific locations of Malarn and Trainlan, it's difficult to determine which dust events, winds, or storms mentioned in points 3 and 4 could impact reefs near Trainlan. As a result, we cannot definitively compare the health of the coral reefs near Malarn and Trainlan without more information about their locations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My oldest moved out when she started college and never moved back in after she graduated. My other daughter wanted to move out as soon as she hit 21 but her dad and I gave her some rules or rather instructions she had to follow before she can pack her bags and move in with the boyfriend. 1st she had to show us that she had 3months rent saved up in her savings account. Not just her half of the rent but the whole rent. Which was about 3,600 dollars. You never know if something happens to her or she looses her part time job she can still pay her rent. Nobody wants an eviction on their record. 2nd since she was still going to school and we were paying for it we wanted to see proof every semester that she was enrolled. Education is a big deal to me. 3rd she had to get on BIRTH CONTROL. I don't want any ooops sorry Mom I am pregnant. Now I can't finish school because I have to work full time to pay for my baby..

Here is a goal: How to clean kitchen cabinet doors. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of cleaning kitchen cabinet doors, it is advisable to follow a step-by-step approach that ensures thorough cleaning and maintains the durability of the cabinet doors. There are various methods to clean kitchen cabinet doors, however, the most effective way involves using a combination of properly selected cleaning materials and appropriate techniques. Here is a detailed long answer to help you achieve this goal: Materials needed: 1. Soft microfiber cloths or gentle sponge 2. Dish soap or mild liquid detergent 3. White vinegar or baking soda 4. Warm water 5. Spray bottle (if using vinegar solution) 6. Bucket or large bowl 7. Rubber gloves (optional) 8. Vacuum cleaner with brush attachment (optional) Step 1: Prepare the cleaning solution There are two potential cleaning solutions - a mixture of warm water and dish soap or a combination of warm water and white vinegar. To make a dish soap solution, mix a few drops of mild dish soap in a bucket or large bowl of warm water. For a vinegar solution, combine equal parts of white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Alternatively, you can create a baking soda paste by mixing three parts baking soda to one part water, especially for spot cleaning stubborn stains and grease. Step 2: Remove excess dust and dirt Before applying any cleaning solutions, it's crucial to remove excess dust and dirt from the cabinet doors. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently vacuum the surface, paying attention to grooves, molding, and corners where dirt may accumulate. If you don't have a vacuum cleaner, use a dry microfiber cloth or soft brush to dust off the cabinet doors. Step 3: Clean cabinet doors with the selected cleaning solution For the dish soap solution, moisten the microfiber cloth or sponge in the solution and wring it out to remove excess water. Gently scrub the cabinet doors, moving in the direction of the wood grain to avoid damaging the surface. Pay attention to edges and corners as well as handles or knobs. If using the vinegar solution, spray it directly onto the cabinet doors and then use a microfiber cloth to wipe the surface. In the case of stubborn stains, apply baking soda paste onto the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and gently scrub it with a cloth or sponge. Step 4: Rinse and dry It is essential to remove any soap or cleaning residue from the cabinet doors. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down the surface and remove any remaining cleaning solution. Be sure not to use excessive water that can damage the wood. After rinsing the cabinet doors, dry them immediately using a clean, dry microfiber cloth to prevent any water stains or damage. Step 5: Polish the cabinet doors (optional) If your cabinet doors have a glossy or shiny finish, you can apply a wood-friendly polish or wax to restore their shine. Apply the product following the manufacturer's instructions and buff the surface using a clean, dry microfiber cloth. Step 6: Maintain regular cleaning To keep your kitchen cabinet doors looking their best, establish a regular cleaning routine. Wipe down the cabinet doors using a damp microfiber cloth at least once a week to remove dust, dirt, and grease. Perform a thorough cleaning, as described above, every few months to ensure the longevity of your cabinet doors. In conclusion, the most sensible approach to accomplishing the goal of cleaning kitchen cabinet doors involves using a careful and regular cleaning routine with suitable cleaning materials and techniques. By following the steps above, you can ensure your cabinet doors are always clean, well-maintained, and looking their best."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"I will attempt to address your inquiries about what girls look for in guys and why you might be single. While I cannot provide a definitive answer, I can certainly discuss general preferences and patterns observed in relationships. Lastly, I will clarify whether the two questions are the same or different. 1. What do girls look for in guys? Is it still tall, dark, and handsome? Step 1: Research studies and surveys on preferences in relationships. Many studies have been conducted to determine what women find attractive in men.  Step 2: Identify general preferences. While not true for everyone, research suggests that women generally find tall, dark, and handsome men attractive. However, the attractiveness of a man is a combination of physical attributes, personality traits, and behavior. Some common qualities that women look for in a partner include confidence, intelligence, humor, kindness, and ambition.  Step 3: Consider individual preferences. Preferences can vary from person to person. Some women might prioritize physical appearance, while others place more importance on personality traits or shared values. Thus, it is essential to remember that attractiveness can be quite subjective. 2. Why am I single? Step 1: Consider possible factors. There could be various reasons for being single, such as choice, timing, or circumstances. It is essential to understand the user's situation to provide a more accurate response. Step 2: Evaluate personal development and relationship readiness. Evaluate whether you are ready for a relationship, focusing on personal growth, career goals, and emotional well-being. Self-improvement is vital for attracting a partner who compliments your values and interests. Step 3: Analyze social involvement. Another reason for being single could be a lack of social interaction. Expanding your social circle and participating in events can increase the chance of meeting someone compatible and forming romantic connections. Finally, I will address if these two questions are the same. While both questions are related to attraction and romantic connections, they are not the same question. The first question pertains to what girls find attractive in guys, while the second question addresses the reasons for being single. However, the two questions are not mutually exclusive, as understanding what girls find attractive in guys might help shed light on why someone is single. By recognizing what women are looking for in a partner and evaluating your qualities in these areas, you could potentially enhance your chances of finding a romantic partner in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The headman was Augusta Gaudron, and the other two men were Tannar and Maitland. They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way. Soon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed up to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 meters! Everything became icy.

I have a new situation: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  But I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering.  What is an answer for this question: Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? The answer to this question is:","output":"Era B would see less rocks with chemical reactions than Era A.  This is because Era A had a higher amount of rainfall compared to Era B (ten thousand years ago vs. eight thousand years ago). As mentioned in the provided background, more rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with the particles, resulting in greater chemical reactions in rocks. In contrast, lower rainfall in Era B would result in a decreased rate of chemical reactions in rocks, as there would be less water passing through and reacting with the particles in the soil. Additionally, high rainfall (Era A) carries away material, exposing new surfaces for further weathering to occur. This process would be significantly reduced in Era B due to the decrease in rainfall. As for the impact of this change in rainfall on the emergence of the Egyptian civilization, it is important to note that the decreasing rainfall in Era B led to the formation of the desert environment we now know as the Sahara. As the area became more arid, human populations might have migrated towards more reliable sources of water like the Nile River, which provided a fertile environment for agriculture. The ability to grow crops and sustain larger populations could have contributed to the rise of complex societies as agricultural practices and resource management became crucial factors for survival and growth of populations, ultimately leading to the emergence of the Egyptian civilization."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others?

This is because the term \\"contrived\\" holds negative connotations, implying that something has been artificially created or manipulated, rather than occurring naturally or authentically. In this context, it suggests that the sequels in question have not been developed due to an inspired or genuine continuation of the original story or characters but have been fabricated for some other motives, such as commercial purposes or to capitalize on the success of the first installment. To better understand this sentiment, it is essential to break down the two terms used in this sentence: 1. Contrived: When something is labeled as \\"contrived,\\" it generally implies that it has been deliberately and artificially created or manipulated, often with the intent to deceive, impress, or gain some advantage. In this case, it carries a negative connotation, as it suggests a lack of authenticity and creativity. 2. Sequels: Sequels refer to follow-up works or continuations, usually in the context of creative pieces, like films, novels, or video games. Sequels are often created to continue exploring the characters and storyline introduced in the original work. When sequels are well-developed, they can provide satisfying additions to the franchise or story, and elicit positive reactions from fans and audiences. When combined, the phrase \\"contrived sequels\\" portrays a sentiment that is less than favorable, as it suggests that the sequels are not products of genuine creative effort. It conveys the idea that these follow-up works have been forced or artificially constructed, perhaps to simply cash in on the original work's success. Consequently, audiences may be led to believe that these sequels are of inferior quality, lacking depth, and ultimately, not as enjoyable or emotionally engaging as the original work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it's important to note that the premise only provides evidence for the topic being discussed once or in at least one instance, but does not confirm it to be popular or repeatedly featured on news TV. Furthermore, the words \\"either CNN or somewhere\\" might also introduce a level of uncertainty about the source of the information being from a news TV channel or any other platform. Even though it is mentioned that it was \\"talking about that,\\" this does not guarantee extensive news coverage or popularity. In the light of the provided information, the most accurate answer to choose would be: - it is not possible to tell The reason for this is that while the premise suggests some recent discussions have taken place, it does not provide strong evidence about the topic being popular on news TV lately.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"Yes, the two questions you asked are essentially the same, both inquiring about the reasons why some individuals continue to believe that the Earth is flat, despite overwhelming scientific evidence indicating otherwise. To provide a comprehensive understanding, I will delve into the possible reasons behind the persistence of the flat-Earth belief: 1. Lack of education and scientific literacy: One factor that may contribute to the belief in a flat Earth is a lack of exposure to scientific knowledge and education. Many people worldwide do not have access to quality education, particularly in the realm of science, which might make it difficult for them to critically evaluate the scientific data supporting a spherical Earth. 2. Misinterpretation of personal experiences: Humans often rely on their senses and personal experiences to assess the world around them. For someone who has never traveled extensively, the Earth may appear flat due to the limited range of their observations. Therefore, they might misinterpret their surroundings and believe that the Earth is flat, despite the evidence against this notion. 3. Distrust in authority or mainstream science: Across the world, trust in institutions, including scientific and educational establishments, has eroded due to various factors. People who distrust established authority may be more inclined to entertain alternative theories or explanations, even those that defy scientific consensus. 4. Influence of misinformation and conspiracy theories: With the expansion of the internet and social media, the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories has become easier and more prevalent. Individuals who encounter such ideas might become more predisposed to question scientific consensus, leading them to embrace ideas like the flat-Earth theory. 5. Psychological reasons: The belief in a flat Earth might offer some individuals a sense of psychological comfort by providing them with a more straightforward and easily understood model of the world. Additionally, this belief might help them feel unique or knowledgeable compared to the rest of society, which can be satisfying and appealing. 6. Cultural and religious factors: Some individuals might be influenced by cultural or religious beliefs that support a flat-Earth model. For example, they may interpret scripture or religious texts as describing a flat Earth, prompting them to reject scientific evidence in favor of their religious convictions. 7. Social aspects: The flat-Earth community has grown and become more organized in recent years, in part due to the internet. This community provides its members with a sense of belonging and shared identity, further motivating individuals to keep believing in this alternative worldview. In conclusion, there are several factors that could help explain why some people still believe in a flat Earth. These factors range from a lack of education and scientific literacy to psychological reasons, distrust in institutions, and the influence of misinformation, conspiracy theories, cultural, religious beliefs, and the social aspects of belonging to the flat-Earth community. While these questions are indeed the same, understanding the underlying reasons behind this belief can shed light on why it persists despite overwhelming evidence supporting a spherical Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Research shows that stress levels peak at the point where the pencil is poised to put a cross in the box against the name of the chosen candidate. This year's local council and police commissioner elections could see even more confusion with some Yorkshire voters being asked to make up to five choices. Even the most seasoned voter can often have a crisis of confidence in those final seconds in the privacy of the voting booth. I have to admit that even after more than four decades of taking part in elections a question still flashes through my mind every time the pencil touches the ballot paper: * \\"Am I ticking the box or putting a cross in it?\\" Surveys say I am not alone. Other regular concerns that come up are: ** \\"Is the candidate representing the party I want?\\" *** \\"Should the ballot paper be signed?\\" These election worry wobbles are only to be expected. Secret ballots mean that voting has to be a solitary experience and phoning a friend is not really an option. At most elections voters merely have to put a single cross against the name of just one candidate. That is exactly the system being used by eight local councils across Yorkshire to elect a fresh batch of councillors this year. However, two others will be asking a lot more of their electorate. Voters in Sheffield and Rotherham will be handed multiple choice ballot papers where they are being asked to pencil in up to three crosses. That is because for the first time these two South Yorkshire neighbouring local authorities are holding \\"all-out\\" polls where every seat is being elected. Traditionally councils use the \\"thirds\\" system in which on three successive years a third of the council seats come up for election. As each council ward is represented by three councillors it means that just one seat is being contested in each election year. Sheffield and Rotherham's full elections means all seats are up for election in every ward so voters will be able to pick three from a long list of candidates on the ballot paper. In Sheffield recent radical changes to the boundaries of all its wards forced a switch to full elections. Rotherham was ordered to contest every seat by the government in the hope of a fresh start for a council tainted by its failure to effectively tackle the scandal of the mass grooming and sexual assault of young girls by criminal gangs in the town. This is in addition to entirely separate elections being held on the same day across England where every voter will be given the choice of putting two crosses on the ballot paper. This is for the local Police and Crime Commissioner elections where the relatively unfamiliar \\"supplementary vote\\" system is being used. A cross can be put against both a first and second choice candidate. If no candidate takes more than 50% of the first choice votes then the second preferences come into play. The top two go into a run-off where the \\"supplementary\\" votes are added to their totals for a winner to emerge. No wonder the council officials who will be running polling stations on 5 May are preparing to spend a lot of time explaining how to vote. Those anxious questions answered: * A cross in the centre of the box against the name of the chosen candidate (or candidates) is the best option to ensure the ballot paper is not \\"spoilt\\". However, as long as the voter's intention is clear a tick or a single stroke of the pencil will probably be sufficient at the discretion of the returning officer. ** Official party name and an emblem are now printed alongside a candidate's name. Independents allowed a six-word description. *** Writing on a ballot paper to identify the voter, send a message to the candidate or make a statement will \\"spoil\\" the vote. What is a summary of this text?","output":"In the upcoming local council and police commissioner elections, some Yorkshire voters may face confusion as they are asked to make up to five choices.

The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. How many points did Nowitzki score in the first half of game 6 of the 2011 NBA Finals?","output":"In the first half of game 6 of the 2011 NBA Finals, Nowitzki scored 3 points.

Look for a low-lying area like a valley or ravine, preferably obscured from the rain. Take refuge here until the storm passes. Crouch down with your heels touching and your head between your knees: this will make you a smaller target. Do not lie down flat, and minimize your contact with the ground. Lightning can be fatal up to one hundred feet away from the initial strike. Check weather forecasts early in the day, and avoid going to a swimming pool, river, lake, or beach on rainy days. If you find yourself in open water during a thunderstorm, return to land immediately. If you are in a boat and cannot return to safety, drop anchor and crouch as low as possible.  Do not return to the body of water until thirty minutes after the last lightning strike. Any earlier, and the storm may not be over.  Indoor swimming is equally unsafe. Avoid all large bodies of water during a storm. Taller objects are more likely to be struck by lightning. Wherever you are, don't become the highest object anywhere. Avoid standing under trees in a lightning storm, and stay away from tall objects like light posts.  If you're in a forest, stay near a lower stand of trees.  Umbrellas can increase your risk of getting hit if it is the tallest object in the area. Metal conducts electricity, and you are much more likely to get hit.

Summary:","output":"To avoid getting struck by lightning, stay away from open fields, hilltops, and large bodies of water. Seek shelter in low-lying areas and maintain a small profile by crouching with your heels touching and head between your knees. Minimize contact with the ground and avoid standing under trees or near tall objects. Monitor weather forecasts and avoid outdoor activities during storms. Drop any large metal objects, but small ones are not a major risk. Remember, rubber shoes or objects do not protect you from lightning strikes. Exercise caution and wait until the storm has passed before resuming outdoor activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: This article: On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein.  1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London.  In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore. contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who was posing for Moore?, what is it ? The answer is:","output":"Irina Radetsky."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iron in 2001. The current EAR for iron for women ages 14–18 is 7.9 mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19–50 and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. The RDA is 15.0 mg/day for women ages 15–18, 18.0 for 19–50 and 8.0 thereafter. For men, 8.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 27 mg/day and, for lactation, 9 mg/day. For children ages 1–3 years 7 mg/day, 10 for ages 4–8 and 8 for ages 9–13. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of iron the UL is set at 45 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes. How many mg/day higher is the ULs for iron than the RDA for pregnant women?","output":"Alright, let me explain this in a simple way. We want to find out how much more iron is allowed in the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for iron compared to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for pregnant women. The UL for iron is 45 milligrams per day (mg/day). For pregnant women, the RDA is 27 milligrams per day (mg/day). To find out the difference, we need to subtract the RDA (27 mg) from the UL (45 mg): 45 mg/day (UL) - 27 mg/day (RDA) = 18 mg/day So, the ULs for iron is 18 mg/day higher than the RDA for pregnant women."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: The given premise describes that three adults and one child are walking along a snow-covered paved path.

There could be other potential relationships or arrangements among the group - for example, they could be neighbors, friends, colleagues, or even strangers who just happened to be walking along the same path. Additionally, the composition of the group, with three adults and one child, does not necessarily fit the traditional structure of a nuclear family. In order to validate or refute the hypothesis, we would need more contextual information such as their interactions with each other, verbal communication, or any specific physical attributes that might indicate a familial relationship, such as shared facial features or body language.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. They do demand it of God, while they still rebel against His law and refuse to keep it! Make this lower case","output":"People often demand things from God while they continue to rebel against His law and refuse to keep it. This contradictory behavior can be observed in various aspects of life, as individuals might seek God's help or intervention but remain unwilling to commit to following His teachings and commandments. To understand this further, let's delve into the factors that might contribute to such attitudes: 1. Lack of understanding or knowledge: Many people may not have a comprehensive understanding of God's law and might not be aware of the extent to which they are not following it. In these cases, individuals may demand something from God, not realizing that they are also rebelling against Him. 2. Justification of actions: Some individuals might feel justified in breaking God's laws, rationalizing that their actions serve a \\"greater good\\" or are a means to secure their own happiness. In these instances, they might seek God's help while still engaging in rebellion against His teachings. 3. Indulging in selfish desires: Human nature often tends to be self-serving and prioritizes personal desires over adherence to morality or divine guidance. As such, people might ask for God's assistance while still indulging in sinful behaviors. 4. Internal struggles: Many people face ongoing battles between their faith and their temptations, convictions, and desires. As a result, these individuals may cry out to God for help in their moments of weakness, even as they continue to grapple with the rebellious aspects of their character. 5. Misinterpretation of God's grace: Some might believe that God's love and forgiveness grant them the freedom to break His commandments without consequences, leading them to demand His intervention while not adhering to His rules. 6. Hypocrisy: In some cases, individuals might adopt a hypocritical attitude and demand God's help for their own advantage while actively disregarding His teachings in their day-to-day lives. In conclusion, people often seek the help and blessing of God while simultaneously rebelling against His law and refusing to keep it. This behavior can arise from various factors, including lack of understanding, justification of actions, selfish desires, internal struggles, misinterpretation of God's grace, and hypocrisy. To better align one's actions and attitudes with their faith, it is essential to gain a better understanding of God's teachings, practice self-awareness, and strive for personal growth and spiritual development."},{"instruction":"Question: where is keith whitley from I found the following answer on Google: He charted 19 singles on the Billboard country charts, including five consecutive Number Ones: \\" Don't Close Your Eyes \\", \\" When You Say Nothing at All \\", \\" I'm No Stranger to the Rain \\", \\" I Wonder Do You Think of Me \\" and \\" It Ain't Nothin' \\" (the last two posthumously).

Answer the following question: Keith designs car seats. He noticed that some other car seats didn't have any padding. He marked it as case A. On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs.  Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A?  Hint: Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Answer:","output":"Based on the hint provided, case B (car seats with padding) would take more time for the force to act than case A (car seats without padding). The padding in car seats increases the time over which the force acts, reducing the overall force experienced by the occupant during an event such as a car crash. This extended time results in a more gradual deceleration and a lower impact force, which contributes to improved safety."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They severely injure Poseidon, and Ares betrays Zeus over showing Perseus more affection, taking him prisoner and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to drain Zeus' power to revive Kronos, the father of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon, in exchange for the two to remain immortal. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters into the world.After slaying a Chimera that attacks his village, Perseus takes Heleus to the Mount of Idols, so they can speak to Zeus, but the dying Poseidon arrives instead. He informs Perseus that Hades and Ares are holding Zeus in Tartarus, and tells him to meet with his demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to find the fallen god Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident before succumbing to his injuries and crumbling into dust. Perseus flies on Pegasus to the campsite of Queen Andromeda's army. Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) has imprisoned Agenor for stealing crown jewels, but Perseus has him released.Perseus, Andromeda, Agenor, and a group of soldiers set out at sea to find Hephaestus, with Agenor explaining that Hephaestus created the three great weapons that Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeus Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidons Trident, and that together they form the...

Answer:","output":"Gretl Braun, whose full name was Margarete Berta Braun, was part of Adolf Hitler's inner social circle. She was the younger sister of Eva Braun, Hitler's longtime companion and, in the last days of World War II, his wife. Gretl was, however, less politically involved than her sister, and her presence in Hitler's inner social circle was largely due to her close familial relationship to Eva. Gretl Braun was a frequent guest at the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's home in the Obersalzberg of the Bavarian Alps near Berchtesgaden, Germany. The Berghof served as Hitler's vacation residence, and it was also a place where he entertained many guests, including his intimate circle. Gretl would have spent considerable time there due to her sister's relationship with Hitler.  The Berghof was a two-story residence furnished lavishly, featuring a large living room with a conservatory and a grand terrace overlooking the stunning alpine landscape. Private quarters, guest rooms, and staff accommodations occupied the remainder of the space. The property also boasted a complex of additional houses, service facilities, security installations, and two SS barracks, making it a highly secured complex. In addition to the Berghof, it is also essential to mention the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, which was Hitler's official residence as German Chancellor. Hitler had an apartment in this neoclassical building where he spent a great deal of time when not at his alpine retreat. In particular, during the later stages of World War II, Hitler spent most of his time in the chancellery's bunker, the Führerbunker. Hitler, his companions, and some of his staff moved into the Führerbunker in January 1945 as Allied armies closed in on Berlin. It was in a reception area of the Führerbunker where Hitler and Eva Braun held their wedding ceremony, with Gretl Braun likely in attendance as one of the witnesses. Gretl Braun consequently would have been in both of these places as part of Hitler's inner social circle. From attending social gatherings at his alpine retreat in Berghof to experiencing the downfall of the Third Reich in the Führerbunker, Gretl Braun's presence was continuous in these pivotal locations of Hitler’s life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A Romanian lawyer is suing his local Orthodox bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. Madalin Ciculescu, 34, accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business. He claimed that after the failed exorcism the demons even started haunting him at his home at Pitesti in Arges County in central Romania. Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, 34, left, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, right, and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. The case alleging 'religious malpractice' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a Romanian court. The four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons, according to the legal papers that named bishop Constantin Argatu, even though he had not been to the property, as he was in charge of the priests who had been there. The case has already been rejected by a lower court in Romania and was rejected again this week by the Romanian High Court, but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights. Unusual case: The court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling. He told the court: 'If they (the accused) represent the way of God then God's ways are crooked.

The man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair-dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property. But the lawyer for the Archdiocese from Arges, Anton Alin, rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man's imagination. The Romanian court agreed with the church and rejected the application against Bishop Argatu as well as priests Ionut Cret Ovidiu, Gheorghe Nicut, Marius Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Dunitru - and ordered Ciculescu to pay legal costs.","output":"- Romanian lawyer Madalin Ciculescu sues local Orthodox bishop and four priests for failing to exorcise flatulent demons from his home. - The demons allegedly caused bad smells, affecting Ciculescu's business and personal life. - This case, dubbed \\"religious malpractice,\\" is the first of its kind in a Romanian court. - The lawsuit has been rejected by both a lower court in Romania and the Romanian High Court. - Ciculescu plans to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To destroy enemy ships [...] Make this lower case.","output":"Destroying enemy ships is a complex and multifaceted task, requiring strategic planning, coordination, and efficient use of available resources. The key elements involved in this process include gathering intelligence, understanding the enemy's capabilities and intentions, having superior technology and firepower, and utilizing effective tactics for successful engagement. To maximize the chances of success, the following steps should be undertaken: 1. Intelligence gathering: The first crucial step in destroying enemy ships is to gather as much information as possible about their position, movements, and capabilities. This can be achieved through various means, such as deploying scout/detecting planes, submarines, or satellites. Additionally, analyzing communications and intercepting signals can contribute to a better understanding of the enemy's plans. 2. Analyzing enemy capabilities: It is essential to have a clear understanding of the enemy's arsenal and strategies to devise an effective plan and allocate resources appropriately. This could involve researching their ships, weapon systems, defense capabilities, and command structure. Intelligence gathered from reconnaissance missions, captured equipment, or surveillance can help in this analysis. 3. Development of superior technology: The development of advanced weapon systems, detection capabilities, and countermeasures is vital to maintaining an edge over the enemy. This involves investing in research and development in areas such as stealth technology, precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare, and drone technology. 4. Tactical planning and coordination: Having a well-thought-out strategy and efficient coordination between various units is indispensable for success in military engagements. This includes assigning specific roles and tasks to different naval vessels, aircraft, and ground forces, and ensuring that they work in harmony during an operation. Proper communication and synchronization between these units can increase combat effectiveness and avoid mistakes and friendly fire incidents. 5. Selecting the right time and place for engagement: A crucial factor in successfully destroying enemy ships is choosing the appropriate location and timing for the attack. This may depend on factors such as weather conditions, sea state, visibility, and the current state of both friendly and adversary forces. Striking when the enemy is unprepared, disorganized, or vulnerable is often crucial for maximizing the potential damage inflicted. 6. Execution of the attack: Once all these aspects have been carefully planned and prepared, it's time to carry out the assault. Various attack options are available, depending on the specific situation and capabilities of both sides. These options include naval gunfire, missile strikes, aerial bombardment, torpedoes, and boarding actions. 7. Utilizing deception and surprise: Catching the enemy off guard can greatly increase the likelihood of successfully destroying enemy ships. This can be achieved by employing deception techniques, such as creating false intelligence, using decoys, or hiding the true size and composition of your forces. 8. Post-attack assessment and adapting tactics: After the initial attack, it is essential to evaluate the results and adjust the strategy if necessary. Conducting damage assessment can provide crucial information on the enemy's remaining capabilities and the effectiveness of friendly forces. Based on this analysis, further attacks may be planned, or alternative tactics may be employed. In conclusion, destroying enemy ships is a multifaceted and challenging task that takes careful planning, superior technology, and meticulous execution. By incorporating the mentioned steps and continuously adapting and improving tactics, one can increase the chances of successfully destroying enemy vessels and achieving strategic objectives."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Attorney says Ivins was innocent in anthrax case, pressure caused his death. Suicide is official cause of death for Bruce Ivins, medical examiner says. Ivins was being investigated in 2001 anthrax attacks, source says.","output":"Title: Understanding the Bruce Ivins Anthrax Case: A Simple Explanation for Little Friends Hello, little friends! Imagine this, you have a puzzle with many pieces. Some bits are shaped differently and have varied colors, right? Now, we'll use that same idea to tell a story about a man named Bruce Ivins. This tale is like a puzzle, and we're going to put different pieces together. Bruce Ivins was a scientist who worked for the U.S. government, just like some people might work for a school or a store. Some people thought he released something very yucky and dangerous, called anthrax. Anthrax is something that can make people very sick, just like if you catch a cold or the flu, but much worse.  Think of anthrax as this really, really bad type of germs that we don't want to catch. Now, some people thought Ivins did this to see if a new medicine, or vaccine, he was working on could stop the bad germs. Testing vaccines is like trying out a new superhero cape on a doll to see if it helps it fly. Soon, more puzzle pieces came into the picture. Some people said Ivins was being investigated, or looked at more closely, for some anthrax attacks that happened in 2001. That's when somebody used these bad germs to hurt others. It's like when your teachers watch you more closely if they think you might have not followed the rules at school.  Bruce's lawyer, or the person who was trying to help him in this tough situation, said Ivins was innocent. Innocent means he didn't actually do anything wrong. The lawyer said that because of all the pressure, he felt very sad and upset, similar to feeling overwhelmed when you have too many homework assignments. But then, we found another puzzle piece. Bruce Ivins was so unhappy with all the worry and stress, he took his own life. His death was then confirmed as a suicide by a doctor who's specifically trained to know how people die, just like how your pediatrician knows specifically about growing children's health.  This is a very serious and complicated puzzle, little friends. Not all puzzle pieces are easy or fun to look at, but they help tell the full story, just like these details we learned about Bruce Ivins.

Question 1: How can Quora make money without any adds? Question 2: Does Quora make money, if yes then how? OPTIONS:  1). no.  2). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answers to these two questions would be essentially the same since both are asking about Quora's monetization strategy.  Quora, a popular question-and-answer platform, was launched in 2009 and for a long time, it didn't focus on monetizing its platform. However, it currently earns revenue through several methods. Does it make money without ads? Let's give a detailed explanation: 1) Advertising: Contrary to the assumption of the first question, one of the main ways Quora makes money is through ads displayed on its platform. It's their primary source of revenue. Businesses and Individuals pay to promote their products, services, or content to the active user base of Quora. The more users click on these ads, the more revenue Quora generates. So, even though users might seldom notice these ads, they exist and contribute significantly to Quora's income. 2) Quora Plus: This is a subscription service implemented by Quora, providing ad-free experience and additional features to its users. Those who subscribe to Quora Plus pay a monthly fee which also contributes to its revenue. 3) Partners Program: In the Quora Partner program, Quora pays individuals to ask questions. This program is invite-only, but it enables Quora to generate more interesting and engaging content to drive more activity on the platform. By doing so, they can attract more advertisers over time and hence increase their ad revenues. 4) Knowledge Market: Quora is testing a new feature that allows users to pay to have their questions answered quickly and accurately by experts on the site. If this feature launches successfully, Quora will get a cut from the transactions, which will also contribute to its income. It's worth noting that while Quora is taking steps to monetize, its primary focus remains on improving the platform and its overall user experience. The company may explore more revenue streams in the future but the focus will be on trying to make sure they align with the overall mission of the company, which is to share and increase the world's knowledge. The specific elements above are the ways in which Quora generates revenue as of now. In conclusion, while the platform does indeed generate revenue without \\"intrusive\\" ads, by offering a premium subscription service and through its partners program, ads still play a significant role in its monetization strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's widely accepted that not knowing your biological parents can be psychologically damaging. There have been documented cases of how not knowing who your biological parents can damage your sense of identity and heritage. Damian Adams, from Adelaide, Australia, was conceived using an anonymous sperm donation in the 1970s. Now Mr Adams is hoping to remove some of those psychologically harmful feelings he has felt since discovering he was conceived by a sperm donation. But rather than tracking down his biological father, something which he is legally forbidden from doing, Mr Adams hopes to address a less acknowledged hurdle. Damian, pictured (middle) with his mother and social father. The current practice for the birth certificate of donor conceived children is for the receiving couple to be listed as parents on the birth certificate. Mr Adams believes his birth certificate is inaccurate and that it is having a dehumanising effect on his life. ‘The current legal practice for donor conceived children is for the receiving couple, or commissioning couple, to be listed as parents on the birth certificate,’ Mr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This means my birth certificate is technically inaccurate. It creates a sense of deception in my life.’ If he is successful, Mr Adams will be the first Australian to have his birth certificate amended so his his father is listed an 'unknown'. 'I'm doing this because I want a factual record of my birth. I'm a firm believer in truth, it's how I was raised. I'm sure my (adopted) father would support me in this decision. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how much I loved my  father, or how much he loved me.' Mr Adams explained that donor-conceived children suffer from a lack of identity. 'We are are already denied access to their heritage and associated kinship. We are denied our medical history. Many animals have have a more accurate birth record than I do and I find that completely dehumanising.' Mr Adams said that his profession was instrumental in the pursuit. 'I work as a medical researcher. It means I am exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, which played a role in my decision to pursue this.' Mr Adams said that his profession of medical researcher has exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, in turn influencing his current pursuit. Mr Adams says he has received support from groups like donor conception Australia, as well as  the full support of my friends and family. Mr Adams filed his his application with the Magistrates Court in Adelaide two weeks ago, but he says that this is something he had resolved to do several years ago. 'I have wanted to do this for a long time, but my family and professional life ended up prolonging the process.' If Mr Adams is successful, he only be second person in the world to have corrected their birth certificate in this way. In July this year, 26-year-old donor-conceived British woman Emma Cresswell became the first person to have achieved the feat, albeit after a six year legal battle. Mr Adams said he wasn't initially influenced by Mrs Creswells plight, but that it was vastly assuring. 'I had decided to do this before I heard about her, but it was very assuring to know that someone had achieved this. Somebody had to take the plunge. It was also opportune timing. If I do get to take this to a Magistrates courtroom, I will certainly be able to use her case to my advantage. The legal system in UK is largely similar to that in Australia.' Mr Adams believes there is no certainty in the outcome of his case to amend his birth certificate, however he believes the case of Emma Crosswell, the only person to have successfully achieved the same pursuit, will assist in his case. However in another sense it proved how difficult the process will be. 'The fact that it took six years, and that it has only ever happened once before-it means I have no certainty of a successful outcome.' Mr Adams says he has received a torrent of support for his cause. 'I've been approached by individuals, as well as support groups like donor conception Australia. There are people in a likewise position who hope to pursue the same path now. I also have the unbridled support of my friends and family, which I'm very grateful for.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Damian Adams, a donor-conceived individual from Adelaide, Australia, is seeking to amend his birth certificate to list his father as \\"unknown\\" instead of having the receiving couple listed as his parents.

Options: - snoring - talking - get cold - nothing - might dream A:","output":"While snoring and talking can occur during sleep and getting a cold may potentially influence the quality of your sleep, the most suitable option to answer the question of what can happen in your mind while sleeping is \\"might dream.\\" Dreaming is a natural part of the sleep process that occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is a stage of sleep characterized by fast, desynchronized brain waves combined with rapid eye movements, muscle atonia, and increased respiration and heart rate. Dreams are most likely to be vivid and story-like during REM sleep, but they can also occur during other sleep stages, although often less vivid and without a clear narrative structure. There are various theories about why we dream, with some suggesting that dreams serve a biological function such as consolidating memories, processing emotions, and maintaining brain health. Others argue that dreams have a psychological function, helping us better understand ourselves, work through unresolved issues or fears, and maintain psychological well-being. Magnificent and bizarre, dreams can transport us to surreal landscapes, create intricate stories, or recreate fragments of our daily lives. They are sometimes vivid and emotionally charged and may involve the people, places, or situations with which we are familiar. While dreaming is a natural and essential part of sleep, there are also numerous sleep disorders that can affect the quality of our sleep, including sleepwalking (or somnambulism), which can involve complex behaviors while still asleep, and sleep talking (or somniloquy), the act of speaking during sleep without being consciously aware of it. These behaviors are typically associated with confusional arousals, which are a type of parasomnia that arises from the transition between sleep stages (especially between non-REM and REM sleep). In sum, while several things can happen during sleep, such as snoring, talking, and being influenced by various sleep-related factors like getting a cold, the most suitable option for answering the question about what can happen in your mind during sleep is dreaming. Dreaming is a normal, complex cognitive process that can reveal fascinating insights into our memories, emotions, and even our deepest desires and fears."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The axial skeleton is the part of the skeleton that consists of the bones of the head and trunk of a vertebrate. In the human skeleton, it consists of 80 bones and is composed of six parts; the skull bones, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone, the rib cage, sternum and the vertebral column. The axial skeleton together with the appendicular skeleton form the complete skeleton. Another definition of axial skeleton is the bones including the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum. Can we conclude that is the tibia part of the axial skeleton?","output":"Based on the information given, the axial skeleton consists of the bones of the head and trunk of a vertebrate. Specifically in humans, it is composed of six parts: the skull bones, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone, the rib cage, sternum, and the vertebral column. It also includes the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum according to another provided definition. The tibia, however, is not listed or included in any of these categories. The tibia is one of the two bones located in the lower leg, along with the fibula, and forms part of the knee and ankle joints.  Given these facts, we can conclude that the tibia is not part of the axial skeleton, but rather part of the appendicular skeleton, which includes the limbs and limb girdles that are attached to the axial skeleton.  This conclusion is made by analyzing the information given and noting that the tibia is not among the listed components of the axial skeleton. The distinction between the axial and appendicular skeleton is determined by the structure and location, with the axial encompassing the central core of the body (head and trunk) and the appendicular including the limbs and their attachment points. As the tibia falls under the category of a limb bone, it is therefore part of the appendicular, not axial, skeleton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Есть не любые контрольно-пропускные пункты и длинные очереди на билет киоск, и они не должны добраться часа просто убедитесь, что они на время их плоскости. Translate to English","output":"There are not any checkpoints and long queues at the ticket kiosk, and they should not take an hour just to make sure they are on time for their flight. The question refers to the absence of certain checkpoints and long lines at ticket kiosks at certain places, like airports or train stations. It emphasizes that it should not take individuals an hour just to ensure they are on time for their scheduled transportation, such as a flight. Such a situation can be inconvenient and cumbersome for travelers, adding to the stress of being at an airport or station to catch their transportation on time. To mitigate this issue, several strategies can be employed to improve the overall experience for travelers: 1. Efficient checkpoint systems: Implementing an efficient security checkpoint system can significantly reduce waiting times at airports or train stations. This can involve integrating modern technology, such as automated passport control kiosks and facial recognition systems that can accelerate the process and maintain security. 2. Online ticket purchasing options: Allowing travelers to purchase tickets online and giving them the possibility to use their smartphones or smart devices as tickets can save time for passengers and alleviate long queues at ticket counters. 3. Improved passenger flow management: Implementing smart passenger flow management systems can provide real-time data about passenger movement within the premises. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and taking necessary actions to resolve them and ensure a smooth flow of passengers. 4. Self-service kiosks: Self-service kiosks can facilitate passengers to check-in, print boarding passes, and complete other required pre-travel procedures without the need for assistance from a staff member. This can not only save time for passengers but also help in easing the workload on airport staff. 5. Designing waiting areas efficiently: To provide a comfortable waiting experience, waiting areas should be designed with sufficient seating and amenities. Charging stations, WiFi connectivity, and clear signage can make the waiting experience much more enjoyable for passengers. 6. Regular communication and updates: Keeping passengers informed about their transportation schedules, updates, gate changes, and potential delays can help them in planning their time accordingly. 7. Queue management technology: Installing digital queue management systems that display wait times and direct passengers to the appropriate checkpoints or kiosks can help in reducing confusion and streamlines the process. Taking such measures can result in a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience for travelers, ensuring that they can reach their transportation on time without spending an excessive amount of time waiting in lines and dealing with unnecessary stress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider a rustic porch if you enjoy a sleek, modern look. Farmhouse porches can have a rugged, contemporary feel that tends to be relaxed.; 3). They are accessible from a concrete driveway or barn. Opt for craftsman vintage woodwork if you want a sophisticated look.; 4). You might also opt for a barn-styled porch if you prefer a more rustic feel. Barn-style porches can be rectangular on one side, and have rails posts at the top that trim to create a ladder-like design.; The answer is:","output":"1).

Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the company that departed Florence second? ?  Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies. Richards and the 12 returning missionaries who accompanied him, traveling in carriages and light wagons pulled by horses and mules, pressed on to Utah to obtain assistance for the emigrants.

Please answer this question: when did political parties first form in the united states?","output":"Political parties first began forming in the United States during the early years of the nation's inception, a period marked by debates over the scope of governmental power, the balance of authority between the federal and state governments, and the interpretation of the United States Constitution. The First Party System, as it is known historically, emerged in the decade following the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 and can be traced back to two primary factions: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans (originally known as the Anti-Federalists). These two groups had starkly different visions for the developing Republic, which fueled the formation of political parties in the nation. The Federalists, led by prominent figures such as Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, favored a strong central government and believed that it was essential for the newly-formed United States to establish a sound financial system, invest in infrastructure, and promote economic growth through trade and industry. In terms of foreign policy, Federalists generally supported maintaining close ties with Great Britain. They were largely comprised of merchants, bankers, lawyers, and other professionals based in urban centers, particularly in the north, and they found strong support among those who advocated for the ratification of the Constitution. On the other hand, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were critical of the concentration of power in the central government and argued for a more limited federal government that would protect individual liberties. They emphasized the importance of agrarianism, with a preference for an economy based on agriculture and rural life, while also advocating for states' rights and strict constructionism in their interpretation of the Constitution. Democratic-Republicans tended to be more sympathetic towards revolutionary France and harbored a mistrust for Great Britain. The party's support base included farmers, small landowners, and residents of the newly-formed western territories, with support also concentrated in the southern states. The early years of political party formation were by no means a clear-cut or straightforward process, and the emergence of these factions took time to crystalize. The election of 1796 is commonly understood as the first instance in which these political parties played a major role in determining the outcome. The election saw John Adams, the Federalist candidate, narrowly defeat Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate; however, a quirk in the process led to Jefferson becoming Adams' vice president. The official and organized establishment of the political parties can be traced to the period between 1796 and 1800. One of the key moments was the formation of the Democratic-Republican Societies, which were set up in 1793-1794 in response to the Federalists' policies and to coordinate political activities in support of the Democratic-Republican vision. By the end of the 1790s, the distinctions and organization of these political parties had taken shape, creating a foundation for the U.S. political party system as we know it today. It is important to note that the founding fathers, including President George Washington, initially frowned upon the formation of political parties, fearing that they would lead to factionalism, regionalism, and the undermining of the very fabric that held the young nation together. Yet, despite these concerns, the formation of political parties proved to be an inexorable development as the new nation sought to navigate its myriad internal and external challenges, laying the groundwork for the intricate and dynamic two-party system that endures in the United States to this day."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Raising Cain Context: Dr. Carter Nix (Lithgow) is a respected child psychologist. His wife Jenny (Lolita Davidovich) is an oncologist. Carter takes time away from his flourishing practice to care for their two-year-old daughter, Amy. Jenny becomes concerned that Carter is obsessively studying their child; he regards her like a scientist tracking the development of his creation.The audience quickly learns that Carter suffers from multiple personality disorder. His multiples are Cain, a streetwise hustler, Josh, a traumatized little boy, and Margo, a middle-aged mother figure. Carter/Cain is killing young mothers to procure their babies and toddlers.In a side story we learn that Jenny is having an affair with Jack Dante (Steven Bauer), the widower of a former patient. She fell in love with him and had a relationship with her years ago, but he left her. Now he's back, and she plans to leave Carter and run off with him. When Carter accidentally discovers their tryst, he descends all the way into his madness.

Carter replies that she is with his father whom Jenny knows has been dead for years.Carter is apprehended for attempted murder. The police bring Dr. Lynn Waldheim (Frances Sternhagen) to interrogate him. Though enduring hypnotherapy, Dr. Waldheim interviews Carter and informs the police that she co-wrote a book with Dr. Nix Sr. called Raising Cain about a boy with multiple personality disorder.

Во время Второй мировой войны, Британский музей закрыл свои двери для посетителей, в связи с опасностью бомбежек и разрушений, которые переживало множество музеев и исторических объектов на территории страны. Главной целью музейной администрации стала сохранность исторических документов и экспонатов, которые были бесценным багажом культурного наследия Великобритании и человечества в целом. С этой целью было принято решение об эвакуации большинства коллекций Британского музея в город Алматы – на тот момент одно из крупнейших культурных многофункциональных центров государства Казахстан, которое тогда являлось частью Советского Союза. В городе располагалось множество музеев, выставочных залов, архивов и научно-образовательных учреждений, которые смогли разместить и сохранить искусствоведческие ценности Британского музея. В процессе переезда в Алматы было эвакуировано более 10 000 экспонатов различных исторических периодов и культур – от античности до 20 века. Среди них были произведения известных художников, предметы декоративно-прикладного искусства, документы, манускрипты, статуэтки и др. Каждый экспонат был тщательно упакован и обозначен, чтобы обеспечить максимальную сохранность при транспортировке. Над адаптацией музейных коллекций для их перевозки и расселению в новых условиях трудились не только сотрудники Британского музея, но и специалисты из Казахстана.

The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery.

She works for a bank in Ramallah, part of the West Bank, Palestinian territories. Each day after work, Muna picks up Fadi from school and crosses through an Israeli checkpoint in order to get to their home in Bethlehem. She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an American green card through the lottery. Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers. They arrive in the United States shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stay with her sister's family in Illinois. After a difficult time with customs, Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby, physician brother-in-law Nabeel and their three children Salma, Rana, and Lamis. Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at White Castle. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle. She maintains the facade through the help of an employee of the bank next door to White Castle and her blue-haired high school drop-out co-worker, Matt.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the husband of the Palestinian Christian woman's sister?

This place floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee! This was my first REAL sushi experience because I always thought I was allergic so needless to say I was terrified! I was really nervous that I wasn't going to enjoy it and insult the chef by spitting it out or choking it down (You dirty birds).  Quite the opposite happened. Not only was it completely tolerable, but I FUCKING LOVED IT!!!   We did the AYCE and I don't recall everything I tried, but here are some of the highlights:   Ahi Tuna Salad- This was the first thing I tried and was surprised by the delicate texture of the tuna combined with the crisp cucumber. Off to a good start.   Rock n Roll- My favorite roll there probably because it had some sort of mayo on it and rice which are both on my cheat list usually. It was all wrapped in cucumber. If I wasn't dieting I would have ordered more. This is the roll I fantasize about the most.   Spider Roll- Crunchy goodness. Nuff said.   Teriyaki Chicken- Hands down the best I've had. It was so moist and not overwhelmingly sweet or greasy. What a perfect option for those non-sushi eaters(FYI- You are on the wrong team!)   Lastly the sashimi.....OMG. The chef sent this over special for us because I was with one of us that eats here often. It was yellowtail simply drizzled with truffle oil and melted like butter on my tongue and that's when Blue Fin and I had a moment..... Up until then everyone at the table was watching the nonfish girl eat fish and I was trying to be graceful about the chewing, etc. . Not now. I wanted to eat it with my hands like Animal from the Muppets. Animal like sushi!!!! Being the lady I am, I contained the inner Animal, but it was still apparent to the table that this was my favorite. Probably the drooling noises gave me away.   All of the fish was so fresh and the presentation showed the pride they put in to each dish. Five star experience from start to finish and I highly recommend it to everyone I know and don't know. Thank you Blue Fin and Willis for turning me into a huge sushi fan!!!","output":"This review is really positive and happy!

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1947, the Muroc Army Air Field in California has test pilots fly high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1, but they die as a result. After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley. Ridley cuts off part of a broomstick and tells Yeager to use it as a lever to help seal the hatch to the X-1, and Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \\"demon in the sky\\". Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base, still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break the other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes, who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \\"prime\\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \\"pudknockers\\" who only dream about it. Gordon \\"Gordo\\" Cooper, Virgil \\"Gus\\" Grissom and Donald \\"Deke\\" Slayton, captains of the United States Air Force, are among the \\"pudknockers\\" who hope to also prove that they have \\"the Right Stuff\\". The tests are no longer secret, as the military soon recognizes that it needs good publicity for funding, and with \\"no bucks, no Buck Rogers\\". Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives are afraid of becoming widows, but cannot change their husbands' ambitions and desire for success and fame. In 1957, the launch of the Russian Sputnik satellite alarms the United States government. Politicians such as Senator Lyndon B.

A person's clothing and accessories cannot definitively determine their activities or plans. A black skirt and handbag could be worn for a wide range of reasons and situations, such as going to the office, attending a meeting, shopping, or any number of other day-to-day activities. To definitively conclude that the woman is going to dinner, additional information like the time of day, the specific location, her direction, or any accompanying people might help to support that assertion. For example, if it's known that she's walking towards a restaurant during typical dinner hours, this could add more weight to the claim. However, even with such additional information, it can't be guaranteed to be accurate, as people's plans and intentions can change, plans can be misleading or mistaken, and multiple factors can influence a person's actions. In conclusion, the statement \\"woman in a black skirt is walking with a handbag on her right shoulder.\\" alone is not sufficient to infer that \\"The woman is going to dinner.\\" Logical conclusions rely on strong, relevant evidence and connections between pieces of information.

Smith, from Vancouver, had been collecting child porn for 12 years when the FBI visited him last July, but he went to extreme efforts to prevent his obsession from being uncovered. His computer on which the graphic images were stored was kept on the second floor of an outbuilding on his property. Kenneth Smith's computer: The PC was found to store more than 8,000 pornographic images. It also controlled the sprinkler system to water his stash of marijuana plants. To get there, investigators had to open a hidden elevator; the operating switch of which, was disguised as a glue can. Smith had been caught sharing child pornography online and subsequently found to have thousands of images showing toddlers and older children being sexually abused. His hidden computer was kept in a room full of marijuana plants. The PC was disguised and used to control a sprinkler system to grow the plants and also store the illegal pictures. Smith pleaded guilty to possession and distribution of child pornography. Going down for years: A secret elevator led to to Kenneth Smith's marijuana growing and child porn computer room. He will now be heading to prison today for the next eight years. Federal prosecutors noted how Smith failed a lie detector test when asked whether he personally sexually abused children.

Trying to downplay the allegations, Smith claimed he’d downloaded photos of older children after being distraught following a breakup. Investigators found more than 8,000 files showing children of all ages being raped and abused.

How is \\"\\"Why?\\" he whispered.\\" said in Czech?","output":"To translate the sentence \\"Why?\\" he whispered.\\" into Czech, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main components of the sentence: The main components are the word \\"Why?\\", which is a question word, and the phrase \\"he whispered\\", which describes the manner in which the question is asked. 2. Translate the main components: \\"Why?\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"Proč?\\". The verb \\"to whisper\\" is \\"šeptat\\" in Czech, and \\"he whispered\\" will be \\"on šeptal\\". 3. Combine the translated components into a complete sentence: In Czech, the subject pronoun often comes at the beginning of a sentence. So the complete translated sentence would be: \\"Proč?\\" on šeptal. 4. Check the translation for correctness: The translated sentence \\"Proč?\\" on šeptal means \\"Why?\\" he whispered in English, which is the correct translation. Justification: I followed the appropriate steps for translating a sentence from English to Czech, identified the key components of the sentence, translated those components accurately, and then combined them to form the final translated sentence, which accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},z={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
