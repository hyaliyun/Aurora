Background: Esma Redzepova-Teodosievska (Macedonian: Esma Redzhepova-Teodosievska Macedonian pronunciation: ['esma re'dZepova teo'dosiefska]; 8 August 1943 - 11 December 2016) was a Macedonian vocalist, songwriter, and humanitarian of Romani ethnicity. Because of her prolific repertoire, which includes hundreds of songs, and because of her contribution to Roma culture and its promotion, she was nicknamed Queen of the Gypsies. Context: During the 1980s, the musical career of Esma Redzepova slowed down. In 1989, she settled back in Skopje with her husband. After independence in 1991, the Republic of Macedonia went through difficult times. Stevo Teodosievski died in 1997 at 72. However, Esma Redzepova toured the United States the year after, performing at a series of benefit concerts. She also released a selection of duets with Usnija Jasarova in 1994.  The 2000s where very fruitful and marked a slight shift in the singer's career. In Macedonia and former Yugoslavia, Esma gained a more modern image and redefined herself as a worldbeat artist. For instance, she made several collaborations with young pop singers. In 2002, she recorded a song with the Croatian band Magazin and a duet with the Macedonian singer Todor Proeski. She also recorded a song with the Bosnian band Crno Vino in 2005 and made a collaboration with Kiril Dzajkovski in 2010. On the international scene, Esma Redzepova contributed towards the establishment of Roma music as a non-mass-market good, pleasing an urban and cultural elite. However, many of her new songs were not widely accepted by Western audience because they did not match its expectation about Roma music. For instance, some songs featured synthesizer, an instrument that is not used in traditional Roma music. Esma was even booed at a concert in Spain, but defended herself saying that Roma music has always adapted itself and borrowed external features.  Her best known single, Caje Sukarije, is the feature song on the 2006 Borat movie soundtrack, which she claims was used without her permission. Together with Naat Veliov from Kocani Orkestar she sued the producers of the film for 800,000 euro (USD 1,000,000). Afterwards, Redzepova won a EUR26,000 compensation, since it turned out that Cohen got permission from her production house to take the song, which she was not notified about. Esma was particularly upset because her song was used to illustrate backwardness, something she always fought. However, Borat contributed towards the expansion of her fame internationally.  Esma Redzepova was selected together with Vlatko Lozanoski to represent Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. Their song, \\"Imperija\\", was unveiled in March 2013, but it caused controversy in the country as its clip featured many monuments of the controversial project Skopje 2014. The song was thus viewed as a nationalist act. Macedonian Radio-Television requested the singers write a new song. Eventually, \\"Pred da se razdeni\\" was released a month later. The song failed to advance from the second semi-final of the competition on 16 May 2013, placing 16th in the field of 17 songs, scoring 28 points. Question: What else did she do in her career?. Whats the answer?","output":"Esma Redzepova was a talented singer, songwriter, and humanitarian. In her career, she not only recorded hundreds of songs and became known as the \\"Queen of the Gypsies,\\" but also 1. Collaborated with various artists, including young pop singers, a Croatian band called Magazin, Macedonian singer Todor Proeski, Bosnian band Crno Vino, and Kiril Dzajkovski. 2. Worked towards promoting Roma culture and music internationally. 3.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Dyslexic Law Graduate Sues on Exam's Time Limit In the newest legal battleground over what assistance must be given to learning-disabled students, a dyslexic 1996 law school graduate has sued the California committee of bar examiners, saying that its refusal to allow him to double the normal time to take the bar examination violated Federal anti-discrimination laws. The class-action lawsuit, filed by Robert Mueller on behalf of all learning-disabled law graduates, said the state had illegally thwarted his career by failing to accommodate his disability, which makes him a slow reader. Precisely what accommodations the Federal law requires for those with learning disabilities has been an increasingly contentious -- and litigious -- issue among educators and testers since 1992, when the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act went into effect. As the first wave of students determined to have learning disabilities moves through graduate education, those students are charting a new frontier, demanding that accommodations like extra time, a quiet room or use of a computer when they take professional licensing exams in law, medicine or accounting. *In June, in a West Virginia case against the National Board of Medical Examiners, a Federal district judge ruled against three medical students with attention-deficit disorder who had sought extra time and a separate testing room on their medical exams. *In July, in a New York case now on appeal, a Federal district judge ruled that the state bar examiners had wrongly refused accommodations to Marilyn Bartlett, a 1991 University of Vermont law graduate who lost her law-firm job in 1992 after failing the bar examination three times, and sued the state in 1993. The judge ordered, among other things, that Ms. Bartlett get double time, use of a word processor and the right to circle multiple-choice answers on the question sheet, rather than fill out a separate answer sheet. *In August, in a closely watched case involving Boston University, a Federal judge ruled that although the university had the right to set academic standards, its crackdown on accommodations to learning-disabled students had been based on uninformed stereotypes. The judge overturned the university's policy of accepting diagnoses only from certain professionals and ordered the university to reconsider whether its foreign-language requirement was essential to its view of liberal arts education. The California bar examiners granted accommodations to 305 applicants taking the July examination this year, down from 335 last year -- but up from 91 in 1990. While some of the accommodations are for students with physical disabilities, the majority are for those with learning disabilities or attention deficit disorder. Lawrence Ashe Jr., the lawyer representing the state bar in the lawsuit filed last month in Federal District Court in Oakland, said he believed the bar's handling of Mr. Mueller's request was proper -- and he suggested that reading at a normal rate might well be a legitimate qualification for becoming a lawyer. Increasingly, Mr. Ashe said, the bar examiners are turning to outside professionals for help in evaluating accommodation requests and are developing new procedures for handling requests. Erica Moeser, president of the National Conference of Bar Examiners, said: ''Matching disabilities to the appropriate accommodations is not an easy task, but I'd say most examiners do their best to truly level the playing field for people with disabilities. It has been a thicket, but my sense is that most disabilities are accommodated, although perhaps not to the level requested. Nationally, California has developed reputation for being among the more generously accommodating of jurisdictions.'' Sid Wolinsky, the lawyer representing Mr. Mueller, said that California's reputation was well-deserved -- until late last year. ''Up until the period leading to the February exam, we never received a single complaint about the bar's failure to give accommodations,'' said Mr. Wolinsky, a lawyer with Disability Rights Advocates in Oakland, who also represented the students in the Boston University case. ''But at the end of 1996, we had a rash of complaints, all of them from learning-disabled students who'd had accommodations in law school, but were being denied for the February bar. Then we had another set of complaints from people denied for the July exam. I've gotten the distinct impression that they're singling out learning disabilities, and cracking down.'' Mr. Mueller's case, he said, is typical of the recent denials. Now 44, he was found to have dyslexia in 1994. According to his psychologist's 1994 evaluation, Mr. Mueller's reading rate is in the bottom 3 percent of college seniors and his timed reading comprehension is in the bottom 5 percent. Untimed, however, his reading scores are in the high average to superior range. After years as a photographer, Mr. Mueller became interested in law and his diagnosis allowed him double time on the Law School Admission Test. As a student at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, he got double time on all his examinations. In 1995, he took the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination with double time -- a requirement for admission to the state bar -- and passed. But the California bar examiners, based on their expert's review of documents he submitted, said Mr. Mueller could only have time and a half for the examination. Mr. Mueller took the exam under those conditions in February, and failed. He took it again in July, but later asked that the exam not be graded. Mr. Ashe was critical of that request, saying, ''I don't think that requesting that your exam not be scored is consistent with someone who wants to be admitted as soon as possible and is mitigating his losses.'' Graph: ''BY THE NUMBERS: Special Needs'' tracks number of stucents with disabilities who got accommodations like extra time on the California bar exam each July. Graph runs from 1990 through 1997. (Source: California Committee of Bar Examiners) Summary:","output":"A dyslexic law school graduate, Robert Mueller, sued the California committee of bar examiners because they didn't give him double the time to take the bar exam. He said this broke the law that tries to help people with disabilities. This law has been causing arguments about what help should be given to students with learning disabilities. More and more students with disabilities are asking for help when they take exams for important jobs like being a lawyer, doctor, or accountant. Some people think that being able to read fast is important for being a lawyer, and everyone should be treated fairly when taking the exams."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"?, using the article: Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although   on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the  music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century. As a..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was 'crying as though her heart would break'?\\" is Bedřich Smetana. He was a Czech composer who faced hardships in his personal life, including a stressful marriage and illness. The article you provided discusses his contributions to Czech opera and the development of a style of music that equated with the emerging Czech national spirit.

Amtrak, for example, lets you pack a bike in a box for 10, carry folding bikes on as luggage, and even offers several trains with walk-on bike cars. Every company is different, however, so don't just buy a ticket and expect your bike to get on easily. You need to do your homework ahead of time to make sure you can transport your bike effectively. Expect a handling fee for bicycles, especially if they are not boxed up. This involves removing all the pieces, stripping off the handlebars, wheels, and pedals so that the bike fits in a large box. While you can usually get old boxes for free or cheaply by inquiring at your local bike shop, entrepreneurial packers can potentially fit the bike very large TV or appliance boxes. If you are uncomfortable with bike mechanics, you may want to get your local shop to break down the bike for you. You can then take the bike to a local shop at your new location to get it back together, for a small fee. This may be important for ensuring you're not carrying too much on board. Check the train service's website for any weight restrictions. Amtrak, for example, has a 50lb limit. This, however, should be more than enough for your bike. If you cannot weigh the bags at home, most Post Offices have a large scale you can use before you leave. Talk to the staff at the station about where you need to be, protocol, and tagging your bike so you can get it later. For longer trips, or anything requiring that you dismantle your bike and pack it in a box, arrive an hour before departure. Many bike shops will break down, package, and ship your bike across the country for you at a nominal fee, usually 20-30 plus shipping. Shipping, however, can get expensive. If you want to do it yourself, you should remove the wheels, handlebars, seats, and pedals and pack them into a bike box or large TV box, then ship the package from a post office, UPS, or FedEx.

Therefore, we can eliminate this option. b) City Hall: City Hall is generally the administrative hub for public entities and typically not a venue for private company meetings. Hence, we can eliminate this option. c) Zoo: A zoo is primarily an attraction for visitors to observe wildlife. It is not an appropriate or professional location for a company's committee meeting. Therefore, we can eliminate this option. Step 3: Compare the remaining options We are left with two options now - office building and boardroom. a) Office Building: An office building might house multiple companies and potentially offer shared meeting spaces.

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the Gathas of Zarathustra, composed between 1,000 BCE – 600 BCE in Greater Iran. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from Ahura Mazda (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening deistic divine God/Grand Architect of the universe tied with a unique eschatology and ethical system implying that each person is held morally responsible for their choices, made freely in this present life, in the afterlife. The importance placed on thought, action, responsibility, and a non-intervening creator was appealed to by, and inspired a number of, Enlightenment humanist thinkers in Europe such as Voltaire and Montesquieu.

Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... contains an answer for the question: What has there been a drastic decline in over the past 100 years that is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water?, what is it ?

Article: He’ll have hundreds of millions of dollars, the bully pulpit, Air Force One and high-profile supporters from Warren Buffett to Lady Gaga behind him. But President Obama’s chances of re-election could come down to a single strategic question: To what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012?      On Politics The Times’s political editor on 2012.      Or to break the question into its most important component parts:      Can Mr. Obama overcome the bad economy, and perhaps even turn it to his advantage in certain ways, in the same way President George W. Bush overcame and in a sense turned to his advantage the bloody, expensive and increasingly unpopular war in Iraq eight years ago?      And can Mr. Obama do to his opponent – for now let’s say Mitt Romney – what Mr. Bush did to Senator John Kerry in 2004?      The parallels are sufficient enough that Mr. Obama and his team have studied, and to a striking degree are replicating, the Bush re-election playbook.      Already they are building a narrative in which Mr. Obama made politically brave decisions to do what was right for the economy, even if those decisions were unpopular. It’s a theme that echoes Mr. Bush’s argument in 2004 that he did what it took to keep the country safe, and that even if you disagreed with him, you knew where he stood.      As for defining the opponent, Mr. Obama’s supporters are already hard at work hammering home the idea that Mr. Romney is an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who says and does whatever is necessary to advance his political interests. It’s an approach that bears a passing similarity to the Bush re-election campaign’s efforts to paint Mr. Kerry as an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who. … You get the idea.      The similarities –- and differences — between the two re-election efforts are a regular topic of conversation and debate among strategists in both parties. “Politics is infused with rich ironies,” said Mark McKinnon, who was Mr. Bush’s media strategist in 2000 and 2004, noting that Mr. Obama had reached the White House in large part by running against Mr. Bush’s record and policies.      At the heart of both approaches is an insight frequently invoked by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush’s strategist, in 2004: an election is a choice, not a referendum. By that, he meant that an incumbent’s job is not to prove he is perfect – it is to prove that he’s better than the other guy.      Mr. Obama’s aides now see their job in much the same way.      “If someone is going to beat us, they’re going to be thoroughly known when they win,” said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s longtime strategist. “They’re not just going to win by default. It’s way too glib to say that not being Obama is going to be sufficient.”      But it is way too early to know if the strategy will work for Mr. Obama as it did, albeit barely, for Mr. Bush.      Matthew Dowd, who was a Bush strategist in 2004 but voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, said Mr. Bush had somewhat better job-approval numbers during his re-election campaign than Mr. Obama does now. As a result, he said, Mr. Obama is at greater risk of facing voters who have already made up their minds to vote against him almost no matter who the alternative is.      “If he doesn’t get some lift in his approval numbers, it will be hard to make this a choice election,” said Mr. Dowd, who met with Mr. Obama late last year as the White House sought to regain its footing following the big Democratic losses in the midterm election.      The Obama team, he said, “wants to make Mitt Romney into the Republican version of John Kerry.”      Mr. Obama stacks up relatively well against Mr. Romney and other Republicans in polls of head-to-head matchups in battleground states. But where Mr. Bush successfully cultivated an image as a decisive leader in a way that sharpened the comparison to Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dowd said, Mr. Obama could have trouble drawing as sharp a contrast.      “The value that the American public is looking for is a strong and decisive leader at a time of anxiety and challenge,” Mr. Dowd said. “In order to make the contrast, you have to have that value yourself, and Obama doesn’t have it.”      Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director in the Bush White House and a senior aide to Senator John McCain’s 2008 campaign, said Mr. Obama’s chances of replicating the Bush strategy also would be hurt by opposition to specific policies, like the health care bill and the economic stimulus spending.      “Obama at his core seems sensitive to the idea that this is going to be a referendum on him,” she said. “You see it in some of their thin-skinned responses to criticism. To me they’re revealing some of their feelings of vulnerability on that question.”      Mr. McKinnon, who left Mr. McCain’s campaign in 2008 because he admired Mr. Obama and did not want to work against him, said that once Mr. Bush and his team settled on a message in 2004 built around national security, they stuck with it, day in, day out. Mr. Obama, he suggested, has yet to find the re-election story line he can use to project his strengths and draw contrasts to Mr. Romney or whoever wins the Republican nomination.      “We decided even if our strategy was flawed, it was better to have one we stuck with rather than a strategy a month,” he said of the Bush 2004 campaign. “Team Obama clearly gets that they need to compare and contrast and they need discipline. The question is, will they have a compelling message and narrative?” ||||| A beleaguered president seeks re-election. His challenger, a candidate with Massachusetts roots and a presidential demeanor straight out of central casting, has to fight through a primary contest fending off charges of flip-flopping. In the end, the challenger's strength also proves his vulnerability.      FILE - In this Oct. 4, 2011, file photo, President Barack Obama speaks at a fundraiser in St. Louis. Democrats in and around Obama’s campaign are targeting Republican Mitt Romney by drawing on lessons... (Associated Press)      Election 2012 is looking a lot like the presidential race of 2004.      Democrats in and around President Barack Obama's campaign are preparing to run against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney _ the man they believe likely to emerge from the Republican contest _ by borrowing from the playbook George W. Bush and Republicans used to defeat Sen. John Kerry seven years ago.      As candidates, Kerry and Romney are remarkably similar. Both are wealthy men, products of Massachusetts politics, eloquent on the stump but perceived as remote or aloof on the campaign circuit.      Even before Romney has won a single nominating contest, Obama's camp is singling him out as a fickle politician and is preparing to go straight at Romney's perceived strength _ his record as a businessman in the face of a flat-line economy. It was a strategy Republicans employed against Kerry, who faced flip-flopping claims himself and whose strength as a decorated Vietnam veteran running in the first post-Sept. 11 election was undermined by attack ads.      A key feature of the Obama strategy is Romney's tenure as head of Bain Capital, a private equity firm he co-founded in 1984 that saved and launched businesses such as Staples and Domino's Pizza but sliced jobs elsewhere through cost-cutting and consolidation.      It's not the first time Romney's tenure at the helm of Bain Capital has come under attack. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pulled away from Romney during his 1994 Senate race in Massachusetts by airing a series of ads that featured workers from an Indiana paper plant that Bain took over, laying off employees, cutting wages and reducing benefits.      \\"Basically, he cut our throats,\\" a worker said in one of the ads.      \\"When we made the decision to define him to voters of Massachusetts and took a hard line in doing so, we had a lot of success,\\" said Democratic consultant Tad Devine, who crafted the ads for Kennedy and later served as a senior adviser to Kerry's presidential campaign.      Obama advisers are keenly aware of Kennedy's line of attack and are counting on similar results.      \\"In his professional life, he was an expert in stripping down companies and leading them to bankruptcy and profiting from these ventures, with a lot of jobs lost in the process,\\" said Obama strategist David Axelrod, previewing a potential line of attack.      \\"Whenever you're running for president of the United States and you represent yourself in a certain way and you say here's my core asset, then you need to be able to stand by your record,\\" Axelrod added in an interview. \\"It was problematic for him then; it will be problematic for him now.\\"      Republicans concede that Romney could be vulnerable. But they say the Romney camp should be ready for the onslaught.      Michael Dennehy, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist, said he remembers Kennedy's anti-Romney ads as being \\"just brutal and very, very effective.\\"      \\"To some extent it will be effective again,\\" he said. \\"The variable is how Romney responds and what they have learned from that 1994 race for Senate.\\"      Dennehy, who helped run Sen. John McCain's presidential races in 2000 and 2008, added: \\"I think we can expect from Obama's campaign a very scorched-earth approach. It's the only way he can win.\\"      Top Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom said Obama, faced with a stagnant economy, is grasping for ways to win. \\"Now, they are employing a \`kill Mitt' strategy,\\" he said. \\"I suspect they'll go through many other strategies before they realize this election is a referendum on Obama's failed leadership on jobs.\\"      For now, the Obama camp is focusing on portraying Romney as a finger-to-the-wind politician who changes his convictions to meet the political circumstances. They cite his embrace of mandatory health insurance when he was governor of Massachusetts and his criticism of Obama's health care bill, which relies on the same mandate, or his previous stance in favor of abortion rights against his current opposition to abortion.      \\"I will give him this, he is as vehement and as strong in his convictions when he takes one position as he is when he takes a diametrically opposite view,\\" Axelrod said last week. On Wednesday, Axelrod pounced again, declaring on CBS that Romney appeared to have \\"no core to him.\\"      No doubt Romney stands as the Republican to beat for his party's nomination. He has maintained a steady position as other Republicans rise and fall around him. Democrats in Obama's circle believe that barring an unexpected development, Romney will be the nominee. As a result, their sideline denunciations are designed to begin a story line they intend to build upon in the general election.      Gerry Chervinsky, a Massachusetts pollster who conducted public surveys during the Kennedy-Romney contest and during Kerry's presidential bid, said attacks on Romney's shifting stances aren't likely to damage him because he confronted them in 2007 and 2008 when he first ran for president.      \\"The Romney business issue, however, I think would score points,\\" he said. \\"Teddy (Kennedy) had excellent info and made terrific TV spots and definitely left the impression that Romney's business record was based on laying people off to make big bucks.\\"      Once the ads ran, Romney was unable to recover and lost to Kennedy. But the damage was not permanent. Romney ran for governor in 2002 and won.      So far, with the exception of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Republicans running against Romney have not tried to turn Romney's business experience against him.      During a debate last week, Huntsman described Romney as \\"somebody who breaks down businesses, destroys jobs as opposed to creating jobs and opportunity, leveraging up, spinning off, enriching shareholders.\\"      \\"The whole discussion around this campaign is going to be job creation _ how can you win that debate given your background?\\" Huntsman asked him.      Romney parried the question, noting that Bain Capital had launched Staples and Sports Authority.      \\"We didn't take things apart and cut them off and sell them off,\\" Romney said. \\"We instead helped start businesses.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"President Obama's chances of re-election in 2012 could come down to a single strategic question: To what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012?

His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon..., what would be the answer ?

But one RBS advisor launched her own bank delivery service when she travelled to a war veteran's home during her lunchbreak to help him following a break-in. Louis Butler, 92, said Victoria Mowbray had restored his 'faith in human nature' by going the extra mile after burglars stole hundreds of pounds in cash from his home. Louis Butler said his 'faith in human nature' was restored by bank worker Victoria Mowbray who went to his aid when he rang to cancel his cards after his home was burgled. When Mr Butler rang RBS customer services to cancel his stolen bank cards Ms Mowbray was so touched by his tale she drove the two miles to his home and rang bank colleagues and even the police on his behalf. Mr Butler, who was honoured personally by King George VI for flying Lancaster Bombers during the war, said: 'The lady at the bank was great and she has restored my faith in human nature. 'She cancelled my missing bank cards and phoned the police for me so I could report the crime. She even called my daughter Angela to tell her what happened. She helped me with everything. 'It just shows the bank can help customers where it matters. I was dreading getting through to a call centre in India but to get through to someone working up the road was like a breath of fresh air. 'For her to then come over and help me was above and beyond the call of duty. I just wish more banks could operate like this when their customers need them.' Widower Mr Butler was asleep when. burglars broke into his home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. and grabbed £300 in cash, his laptop, his passport and other important. identification and information. He woke up to find his desk drawer tipped out and flung to the floor and his back door left wide open. His. Distinguished Flying Medal, received from King George VI in 1943 for. his service as a wireless operator who took part in bombing raids over. Germany, was only saved as he had given it to his daughter for safe. keeping. Mr Butler said: 'I was shaken when I woke up and saw everything had been taken. 'My desk was open and the drawers were all out and so was the draw in the table in the hall.

'They took my laptop, my folder with all my phone numbers and important letters and bills, my passport - everything that they could get their hands on. They also took £300 out of a cash jar that I have in the desk. 'I didn't know what to do until I found the phone number for the Royal Bank of Scotland customer services, so I rang them. A nice lady answered and I was very surprised but happy that she was from my local the branch rather than from a call centre in India. 'I'm hard of hearing and knew I wouldn't understand them if I got through to someone there. 'When I told her what had happened the lady just dropped everything and came straight round to my home in her car to help me cancel my cards. I was amazed. She is so helpful. I can't thank her enough.' Mr Butler's daughter Angela Hobson, 55, said: 'Dad was disorientated when he came downstairs to find all his stuff missing and what Victoria did shows there are some very kind people left in this world who go over and beyond what can be expected. Victoria Mowbray, who works at The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) branch in Shaw, pictured, has been praised for going the extra mile to help Mr Butler. 'Dad is well known and very well liked and people in the locality were disgusted and outraged when they found out what happened. 'It must have been obvious to whoever broke in that an old person lived there. He had his war pictures of Lancaster Bombers on the walls and a stairlift but it still didn't stop them.' Ms Mowbray, who works in the Shaw branch in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'I don't think I have done anything special. 'When he rang the bank, I didn't even know if he was a customer of ours or not. He was saying he was a 92-year-old man and he had been robbed. 'He said he had gone downstairs and they had taken everything. I was worried there was no-one at home with him and I couldn't have that on my mind, especially if he was in shock. 'I told my manager I needed to go even if it was my lunch. I helped him cancel all his cards and I called the police on the way to the house.

Perform progressive muscle relaxation Expose your body to cold water, weather, or beverages. Undergo surgery to implant a device that stimulates your vagus nerve electrically.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Boost Your Vagus Nerve Function: A Holistic Guide to Enhance Your Well-being Introduction The vagus nerve is a critical part of the human nervous system that connects the brain with several major organs, playing a vital role in controlling heart rate, digestion, and other essential functions. Studies have shown that stimulating the vagus nerve can help improve physical and mental well-being. In this article, we'll discuss various ways to stimulate the vagus nerve, such as breathing exercises, yoga, moderate to intense exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, and exposure to cold conditions. We'll also discuss a more invasive method: undergoing vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through implantable devices. Step 1: Perform slow, deep breathing exercises One effective way to stimulate the vagus nerve is through slow, deep breathing exercises. Breathing is an involuntary, but also a controllable, process. By consciously controlling your breath, you can activate the vagus nerve, which can lead to reduced stress and increased relaxation. Begin by inhaling deeply through your nose for five seconds, and then exhale through your mouth for another five seconds. Repeat this process for a few minutes daily to improve vagal tone and promote overall relaxation. Step 2: Practice yoga for 90 minutes every week Yoga is known for its numerous physical, mental, and emotional benefits, including stimulating the vagus nerve. Yoga combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation, which can improve vagal tone while also benefiting your overall health. Aim to practice yoga for at least 90 minutes per week, either in a class setting or through home practice. As you become more experienced, you can incorporate specific poses that are known for their positive effects on the vagus nerve, such as the fish pose and camel pose. Step 3: Engage in moderate to intense exercise 4 times a week Regular exercise is another effective way to enhance vagal function. The increased heart rate and elevated blood circulation that come with moderate to intense workouts can stimulate the vagus nerve. Aim for at least 4 sessions of exercise per week, whether it be running, swimming, cycling, or any other activity that raises your heart rate. Be sure to consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise routine. Step 4: Perform progressive muscle relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a technique used to induce deep relaxation by tensing and releasing various muscle groups. This process can help stimulate the vagus nerve while reducing muscle tension and stress. To perform PMR, find a quiet space to lie or sit down comfortably. Begin by tensing a specific muscle group, such as your toes, for 5-10 seconds, and then release the tension for 15-20 seconds. Gradually work your way up, focusing on different muscle groups throughout your body, until you reach your facial muscles. Step 5: Expose your body to cold water, weather, or beverages Exposure to cold conditions has been shown to activate the vagus nerve. Short, cold showers, cold weather, or consuming cold beverages can promote vagal activation, which may lead to increased resilience against stress. Begin with short bursts of cold exposure and gradually increase the duration. Always listen to your body and avoid overexposure to extreme cold for prolonged periods. Step 6: Consider undergoing vagus nerve stimulation surgery (Optional) For individuals with certain health conditions or those seeking a more invasive approach, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) surgery might be an option. VNS involves implanting a small device that electrically stimulates the vagus nerve. While it's primarily used to treat epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression, some studies suggest that it might also improve overall well-being. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if VNS is the right choice for you. Conclusion Strengthening the function of the vagus nerve is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being. Through slow, deep breathing exercises, yoga, moderate to intense exercise, progressive muscle relaxation, cold exposure, and potentially VNS surgery, you can enhance your vagal tone and promote a more resilient mind and body. Start incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, and take a step towards a healthier, happier life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Lunna and her friends meet the various celestial beings who hold clues to the unfolding mystery, and in doing so, they learn to harness their unique abilities. In the course of the adventure, Lunna discovers that she is half-celestial being, which bestows upon her an extraordinary power that could both save and destroy the kingdom. Finally, the group locates the source of the darkness: a corrupted celestial being named Eclipsa, who seeks to prevent Lunna from claiming her rightful place among them. A climactic battle ensues, during which the group unites their newfound powers and skills to defeat Eclipsa, and Lunna is forced to make a heart-wrenching decision that leaves her forever changed. With the darkness lifted, the kingdom is once again bathed in light, and Lunna is reunited with her mother, Queen Celestia. Their emotional reunion reveals that Lunna's journey was a test of her character, loyalty, and ability to rule. As the rightful heir to the Solarian throne, Lunna promises to lead her people with wisdom, strength, and compassion, leaving the celestial beings to watch over her from the stars above. As the movie concludes, Princess Lunna's legend is etched into the history of Solaria, and she embraces her destiny, ushering in a new era of peace, prosperity, and harmony between humans and celestial beings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 03:44 EST, 15 June 2013. |. UPDATED:. 04:32 EST, 18 June 2013. The British people are weary of becoming involved in another lengthy conflict overseas. after more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, the. Defence Secretary said today. In what. will be considered a direct challenge to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor over any. possible military deployment to Syria, Phillip Hammond said Afghanistan. had become Britain’s Vietnam. The Defence Secretary's remarks came. while on a visit to the main British base at Camp Bastion in the Helmand. province of Afghanistan. Vietnam effect: Phillip Hammond has warned Afghanistan has become for the British what Vietnam was for America. His remarks also come amid heightened tensions over the. Middle East between the West and Russia, as the US prepares to arm rebel fighters after it. confirmed the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on its own people. Mr Cameron has resisted greater. involvement in the Syrian conflict for the last two years partly over. fears of comparison with ex-PM Tony Blair, who took Britain into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq two years later. The Prime Minister will use the G8. Summit in Northern Ireland to talk to US President Barrack. Obama about how best to arm rebels in the country who have been trying. to topple the regime of Bashar al Assad for the past two years. Cuts row: Phillip Hammond has warned further cuts to the Ministry of Defence's budget will hurt Britain's operation effectiveness. He has already held preliminary. discussions by video conference with Mr Obama, the French President. Francois Hollande , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime. Minister Enrico Letta, a Downing Street spokesman confirmed this. morning. ‘Three days before a working dinner on. foreign policy, they discussed the situation in Syria and how G8. countries should all agree to work on together a political transition to. end the conflict,’ Downing Street said. Britain has been engaged in almost continuous conflict in the Middle Eat since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001. Since then, 444 British Service personnel have died in the Afghanistan and thousands more have been seriously injured. 'I suspect that the British people - and. not just the British people - will be wary of enduring engagements on. this kind of scale for perhaps quite a long while in the future,' Mr. Hammond said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph. 'You might call it the Vietnam. phenomenon - when an engagement turns out to be longer and more costly. than originally envisaged, there is often a public reaction to that.' Mr Hammond added the true lesson from. Afghanistan may be that a prolonged military commitment could have been. avoided if the West had been prepared to intervene earlier before al. Qaida launched its attack on the Twin Towers. 'We ourselves have learned the lesson. that earlier, smaller scale intervention may often avoid the need for. more massive intervention later, and if we are in a mood for beating. ourselves up, perhaps we should have foreseen the consequences of what. was happening in Afghanistan before 9/11,' he said. 'Perhaps we should have been more. forward leaning in the West collectively in intervening to try and head. off what was happening here before it happened.' Combat fatigue: the Defence Secretary warned this weekend that the British people had become weary of the UK's involvement in overseas operations. On patrol: British soldiers have been involved in active operations in Afghanistan for 12 years. Earlier this week Mr Cameron raised the prospect of weapons falling into terrorist hands. ‘Elements affiliated to al-Qaeda in the. region have attempted to acquire chemical weapons for probable use in. Syria,’ the Prime Minister said. Britain is currently providing. ‘non-lethal’ equipment to the Syrian rebels but Foreign Secretary. William Hague has, with the support of France, been working had to lift a. European Union arms embargo. US confirmation of British and French. reports that the Syrian army was using chemical weapons against the. rebels has increased the prospect of weapons being passed to the rebels. Mr Hague said earlier this week the West 'must do more’ to put pressure on the. Assad regime to reach a peaceful settlement with the rebels and stop the. bloodshed which the UN says has so far cost in excess of 93,000 lives.

The Defence Secretary's comments came amid heightened tensions between the West and Russia over the Middle East, as the U.S. prepares to arm rebel fighters in Syria after confirming the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons on its own people. 4. British Prime Minister David Cameron has resisted greater involvement in the Syrian conflict for the past two years, partly over fears of being compared to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who took Britain into Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. 5. The Prime Minister planned to discuss with U.S. President Barack Obama at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland how best to arm rebels in Syria who have been trying to topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad for the past two years. 6.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding  you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue  in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels  compared to 2.75 pretzels for the \\"quiet\\" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the \\"Crunch Effect.\\" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. \\"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\\" Elder said. \\"The effects may not...

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What method pioneered the movement forward for sound systems? Context: The development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today. Answer:","output":"The method that pioneered the movement forward for sound systems was the development of quadraphonic records, specifically through electronic matrixing which allowed for the combination of additional channels into the main signal.

He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves. That was 30 years ago, and I still get tears just thinking about what I consider the most beautiful moment of my life, one that I was lucky to share with these two wonderful people.

If I tell you that Houses have disappeared because of precipitation, and ask you the question \\"houses have disappeared because of what?\\", is the correct answer \\"physical weathering\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer would not be \\"physical weathering.\\" While physical weathering might have a role in the overall degradation and ultimate disappearance of houses over time, it would not alone solely account for houses disappearing due to precipitation. To provide a more comprehensive and detailed answer, we have to consider the following factors and explanations: 1. Precipitation refers to any form of water that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface; it includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Precipitation can lead to several types of problems for houses, particularly when it is excessive, or there is poor drainage or inadequate protection for the structure. 2. One possible explanation for the disappearance of houses due to precipitation could be erosion. When precipitation falls on the ground and begins to flow downhill, it might erode away the soil, which may cause instability in the foundations of houses, ultimately leading to their collapse or disappearance. This, however, typically occurs over an extended period rather than instantly. 3. Another potential factor behind houses disappearing due to precipitation is flooding. Heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt can cause rivers, streams, and other bodies of water to overflow their banks, leading to inundation of nearby areas. If houses are located in low-lying or flood-prone regions, they may be severely damaged or even be swept away entirely during floods. 4. In addition to erosion and flooding, landslides and mudslides could also explain the disappearance of houses due to precipitation. These events can occur when the ground becomes saturated with water, and its stability is compromised. The increased weight of the water-laden soil, combined with gravitational forces, can cause the land to give way, burying or destroying homes in its path. 5. Finally, it's worth mentioning that precipitation can contribute to the process of physical weathering of the construction materials, as repeated cycles of wetting and drying, as well as freeze-thaw cycles, can lead to cracks, crumbling, and eventual decay of buildings. However, this process takes place over an extended period and typically does not cause the sudden disappearance of a house. Therefore, while \\"physical weathering\\" might have a role in the overall degradation and disappearance of houses, it is not the sole explanation for houses disappearing due to precipitation. Instead, the answer should encompass the various factors such as erosion, flooding, landslides, and mudslides, which could potentially cause houses to disappear in the context of heavy precipitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This can be broken down into the following sub-steps: 1. Formation of urine: After the kidneys have processed the blood, separated waste, and returned the filtered fluid back to the bloodstream, the waste products combined with excess water form urine. The urinary system is composed of several different structures that aid in the formation and excretion of urine, including the nephrons (the functional units of the kidneys), the renal tubules, and the collecting ducts. 2. Transport of urine: Once urine is formed, it needs to be transported out of the kidneys. The urine flows from the renal tubules into the collecting ducts and then leaves the kidneys through the ureters, two muscular tubes that connect the kidneys to the urinary bladder. 3. Storage of urine: The urine moves from the ureters into the urinary bladder, a hollow, muscular organ that expands as urine fills it. The bladder stores the urine until it is full and the person feels the need to urinate. 4. Excretion of urine: When the urinary bladder is full, nerve signals initiate the process of micturition (urination), during which the muscles of the bladder wall contract and the internal urethral sphincter relaxes. This action causes the opening of the urethra, the tube through which urine exits the body, and allows the urine to flow out, effectively eliminating waste products from the body. In summary, the final step of the process involves the elimination of waste in the form of urine, which is accomplished by forming urine from waste products and excess water, transporting the urine out of the kidneys and into the urinary bladder, storing the urine until the bladder is full, and then excreting the urine from the body through the urethra."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this \\"Shares in Admiral fell 6% after the insurer said the rising cost of personal injury claims hit profits.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Admiral Insurance Faces 6% Drop in Shares Amid Rising Personal Injury Claims Costs Introduction: Admiral Insurance, a leading insurance provider, has recently experienced a 6% drop in shares as it revealed the growing burden of personal injury claims affecting profits. The company, which offers a broad range of insurance products, such as car, home, travel, and pet insurance, has been caught in the upward trend of rising personal injury claim costs. This development may have far-reaching implications for the insurance industry and customers, alike. In this article, we explore the factors that led to the decline in shares, the steady increase in personal injury claim costs, and the potential consequences of this trend for the insurance industry and policyholders. Factors Leading to the 6% Drop in Shares: The decline in Admiral's share prices can be attributed to various factors. First and foremost, the announcement of the connection between the increased personal injury claims expenditures and the impact on profits led investors to reconsider their positions on the company's stock. Investors may see this drastic increase in claim costs as a reflection of the insurer's inability to manage claims expenses efficiently or as the revelation of a wider industry problem that could result in further profit declines in the future. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainty in the economic landscape, fueled by the global pandemic, has added another layer of apprehension for investors. The pandemic has disrupted various industries, including insurance, where it has led to delays in claim resolution, significant premium adjustments, and unforeseen expenses related to remote work and business operations. This uncertainty may have played a role in investors' decision-making processes, resulting in the sale of stocks, thereby contributing to the 6% fall in shares. The Rising Cost of Personal Injury Claims: The primary reason for the decline in Admiral's shares is the impact of rising personal injury claim costs on the insurer's profits. Several factors contribute to these increased costs, including: 1. Legal Reforms: Accidents or injuries resulting in personal injury claims may entail a legal battle, depending largely on the nature and severity of the case. Legal reforms, such as those in the UK with the Civil Liability Act 2018, have been aimed at reducing the number of fraudulent claims and lowering legal fees. However, these reforms have inadvertently led to higher compensation payouts for genuine claims, which has had a negative impact on insurers' financial health. 2. Medical Inflation: Medical treatments are becoming more expensive, and claimants seek compensation for these exorbitant costs. As a result, insurance providers have to grapple with the escalating payouts for claimants, which subsequently affects their bottom line. 3. Greater Public Awareness: With increased societal awareness around personal injury claims, more people are pursuing compensation for injuries sustained in accidents. This higher volume of claims puts additional pressure on insurers to pay out more in compensation while also managing their claim costs efficiently. 4. Rising Litigation Costs: The legal process for settling personal injury claims can be intricate, and the associated costs continue to climb. The increase in legal costs adds financial strain on insurance companies and may force them to increase premiums to cover these expenses. Implications for the Insurance Industry and Customers: The rising cost of personal injury claims and the subsequent drop in Admiral's shares signal serious consequences for the insurance industry as a whole. Insurance providers may be forced to reassess their risk management strategies and work towards efficient claim handling processes. Moreover, they may need to explore the implementation of advanced technologies and automation to streamline claim-handling processes and reduce costs. Furthermore, insurers might have to reevaluate their premium rates, potentially leading to increased premiums for customers. For policyholders, this could translate to higher insurance costs, and they may have to reconsider their coverage options and the affordability of various insurance products. Conclusion: The 6% drop in Admiral's shares serves as an important milestone in the ongoing struggle faced by the insurance industry with rising personal injury claim costs. This development may force insurers to reevaluate their risk management strategies, implement changes to improve efficiency in handling claims, and reconsider their premium rates. For policyholders, the rising costs could lead to a tough choice of ensuring adequate coverage against the increasing expenses associated with insurance products. It remains to be seen how the insurance market will evolve to combat this issue, and whether the appropriate balance between risk management, cost containment, and consumer affordability will be achieved in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In agriculture and animal husbandry, the Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield. Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases. Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization. Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution.

A couple of years ago, my dad told me that he had a cataract in his eye and could barely see out of it and that he needed to get it fixed. \\"Cool. Go to the doctor and get it taken care of,\\" I said. \\"I will,\\" he replied. One month became three; three months turned into six months; and a year later and numerous calls later by a ticked-off son, he still had not gone to the doctor. So one morning, when I was hosting the 6 to 9 a.m. talk show shift on WVON-AM in Chicago, Illinois, I told my producer, Geneen Harston, to call my dad, but don't tell him he'll be on the air. When the commercials ended, I pulled him up on the air and asked, \\"So, dad, have you made that doctor's appointment?\\" He started to laugh and said that he had done so the day before and that he was seeing the doctor later in the week. Luckily, he followed through, and they discovered that he had another one growing in the other eye. Both eyes were taken care of, and all has been well since. Yet what ticked me off was that here was a guy with insurance, a son who could pay for the bill even if he didn't, but he still refused to go to the doctor!  Watch Roland's commentary segment ». My dad's story is all too common to a lot of you who must deal with fathers, brothers, uncles, husbands and male cousins, church members and co-workers, who are obstinate and absolutely refuse to go to the doctor. \\"Oh, I'll be fine.\\" \\"I can handle the pain.\\" \\"I don't want a doctor poking on me.\\" \\"If it's bad, I'm sure it would hurt worse.\\" All typical responses, and all pretty dumb. Yes, it's true that women all around the globe have outlived men for years. In the United States, the life expectancy for men is 74 and for women is 80. Yet when that is broken down racially, there is a huge gap between whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Men are dying earlier due to prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke and other maladies, and their actions play a large role in it. Black men in particular drive me nuts. I've heard several mention that their aversion to doctors stems from the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, the study conducted between 1932 and 1972 that monitored black sharecroppers who were infected with the disease but didn't treat them, much less inform them that they had it. That program by the U.S. Public Health Service was hideous but shouldn't be used as an excuse today. Men can no longer be so hard-headed about their health. I've given speeches on this issue and told married women that they should say, \\"no doctor's visit, no sex.\\" That'll get his attention! We all love the men in our lives. But being silent means we are aiding them in their health dilemma, and that's wrong. If it means lovingly reminding, fine. If you have to badger them, whatever. Just like Dad told us to eat our vegetables when were kids, saying we'll be better off as adults because of it, we should tell Dad or any other man to stop acting like a child and go see the doc. It really could save their life. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Roland Martin. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In this article, the author recounts his personal experience with his father, who displayed a reluctance to seek medical attention for his cataract despite having insurance and the financial means to cover the costs. Although the author's father eventually went to the doctor due to the author's persistent urging, it was discovered that he had another cataract growing in his other eye. This behaviour is characteristic of many men who are stubborn and refuse to visit doctors, often leading to health conditions getting worse or being detected at later stages.  The author emphasises on the importance of regular health check-ups and early detection, and criticises the harmful masculinity stereotype of enduring pain or dismissing potential health issues. He highlights the unfortunate fact that men in general, and black men in particular, have a well-documented aversion to seeking professional healthcare which leads to a lower life expectancy compared to women. He also denounces the tendency to use historical events such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment as an excuse to avoid medical checks and screening. The author encourages both men to change these attitudes, and others to proactively prompt the men in their lives to seek regular health checkups. He suggest creative tactics such as making certain privileges conditional upon health checkups. With the underlying message being that prevention is better than cure, the author asserts that, if necessary, more aggressive reminders and incentives should be used, as the ultimate goal is to save lives and improve health. Finally, the author points out that this perspective is his own and may not be representative of the broader population but hopes that it stirs discussion and consideration towards men's health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - The Temple of Elemental Evil is a 2003 role - playing video game by Troika Games . It is a remake of the classic Dungeons & Dragons adventure of the same title using the 3.5 edition rules . This is the only video game to take place in the Greyhawk campaign setting , and the first video game to implement the 3.5 edition rule set . The game was published by Atari , who then held the interactive rights of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise . The Temple of Elemental Evil was released in autumn of 2003 and was criticized for stability issues and other bugs . The turn - based tactical combat , however , was generally thought to be implemented well , and is arguably the most faithful representation of the then - current tabletop role - playing game ( \`\` 3.5e '' ) rules in a video game .  - Troika Games was a video game developer co-founded by Jason Anderson, Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky. The company was focused on role-playing video games between 1998 and 2005, best known for \\"\\" and \\"\\".  - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid-1990s. In 1996, it was the name of Atari Corporation's PC publishing division, bringing games like the Atari Jaguar's \\"Tempest 2000\\" to the PC platform. From 1998 to 2001, Atari Interactive, Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998, and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive. It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari, SA (formerly Infogrames), who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive. It was formed in 2001, when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive. In 2003, IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive, Inc. as part of its worldwide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand.  - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview.  - Tim Cain is an American video game developer best known as the producer, lead programmer and one of the main designers of the 1997 computer game \\"Fallout\\". In 2009 he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - Leonard Boyarsky is an American computer game designer and visual artist best known for being one of the key designers of the video games \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Diablo III\\".  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983.  - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.  - Nolan Kay Bushnell (born February 5, 1943) is an American electrical engineer and businessman. He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \\"Newsweek\\"s \\"50 Men Who Changed America.\\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success.  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, but it's still pretty damn long, so apologies in advance.  I'm a sophomore in college and my birthday was late in January. Towards the beginning of the month during break I had asked my mom if they would be able to come down to campus around my birthday and do something with me and my friends. I wasn't sure if financially they could, as a couple things had happened that made money more of a concern than usual. She told me not to worry about that and to figure out what I wanted to do. Over the next few weeks I had a lot to do - with classes starting, research, my grading job, and trying to find time for my friends and a little for myself I was pretty busy. Because of this I kept forgetting to figure out what I wanted to do when they came. My mom continued asking every few days or so, but I kept forgetting (this is a common problem with me and it's really frustrating, it leads to issues for me sometimes). I should also note that I'll miss calls or texts from them a decent amount because I'm not around my phone often, but at home I'm more attentive to it because I have much more free time. This frustrates my parents, especially my mom, as they think I don't pay attention to them. Anyway, it got a to few days before the weekend before my birthday, and my parents told me they couldn't make it that morning and would come next weekend. I decided that week that I wanted to either go bowling or play mini golf, depending on what worked best for everyone. I told my mom, and she said I needed to figure out which for sure, what time, who was coming, if anyone needed a ride, etc. I'd say this was about Monday, maybe? I was busy throughout the week and didn't have much time to talk to people, alongside the fact that I would constantly forget only to remember later and feel anxious about it. This all finally came to a head last night, where my mom snapped. Something important is that she has some anger issues. She would never hurt me or anything, but she gets extremely angry and screams. Well, that's what happened. I was with my girlfriend in bed late at night and had forgotten my phone in a different room. I remembered it and went to grab it. Then I saw my mom had texted me several times and tried to call me 10 times in the span of two minutes. I should also note that using Tasker I had it set up on my phone so that if I shook my phone, it would mute all sound and automatically reject calls. I had left it on before I left my phone, so no sound was being played and all calls were being rejected. So I shit myself out of terror and called her immediately. She then yelled at me for 7 minutes about how I didn't care about her or my dad and that I was being disrespectful for not getting back to her sooner. There was more she said, but I've forgotten most due to a bit of overload and just generally being forgetful. She concluded by asking why if I don't care, she should care and said something else after that. I couldn't hear the last part because I was exhausted, so I asked what she said and apologized saying that I was tired and missed it. Then she said \\"You know what? I'm done. BYE!\\" and hung up on me. My girlfriend and I talked about it, and I turned my volume on anticipating that I would get a call back. About 20 minutes later I did. I can't remember much of that call, just that it was upsetting. At one point I know she said if I disrespected her like that again she would keep my truck (which is being repaired - they're paying for the repairs if that matters), break my phone, bring me home every weekend, and at some other point she said she'd break my fingers (dont remember how that came up? It was still while saying basically that I had better never do that again. I should also clarify that my mom has never hurt me and I know she wont, even if she threatens to sometimes when she gets really angry). Those were the most intense things, but the rest of the call was also pretty bad. Sorry I can't give more of it. Earlier today my Dad called to figure out what I had wanted to do. I told him what I had planned and we put together the last parts (ended up being bowling if anyone cares). He was also angry about how I had waited until the last minute and yelled at me a bit too, though it wasn't nearly as bad as with my mom. He basically was telling me how frustrating it was to not be able to contact me when they need me, and that it seems like I don't care about them. He did say they wanted to do this for me and see me but it seemed like I didn't care at all. In addition he said I was stressing my mom out because they didn't know what was going on yet, that my mom was already feeling sick and that was making it worse, and that they spent an hour last night talking about me and this whole thing when they could've been sleeping. My mom was there too and said something along the lines of how I only want their money and don't give a damn about them. After a bit of that we hung up, and that's where I am now. So, I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, I really should've figured things out earlier. I meant to, I just was busy and kept forgetting, though my parents say that's not an excuse. I can be pretty bad about getting back to them sometimes. Usually I'll respond within a day, but once in a while I'll miss it for longer. I can see how that would be frustrating. But on the other hand, I feel like they, especially my mom, went way overboard and that it wasnt nearly bad enough to justify that kind of response. This sort of thing happens somewhat often and I usually feel conflicted about it. I've wanted to post before, but never did until now. So, AITA?

She achieved critical acclaim with her own recordings, particularly the albums Eli and the Thirteenth Confession (1968) and New York Tendaberry (1969), and had commercial success with artists such as Barbra Streisand and The 5th Dimension recording her songs. By 1976, her marriage had ended, and she released an album of new material, Smile. She then embarked on a four-month tour with a full band, which resulted in the 1977 live album Season of Lights.  After the 1978 album Nested, recorded when she was pregnant with her only child, she again took a break from recording, this time until 1984's Mother's Spiritual. She began touring with a band in 1988, her first concert appearances in 10 years. The tour was dedicated to the animal rights movement. The shows led to her 1989 release, Laura: Live at the Bottom Line, which included six new compositions.  Her final album of predominantly original material, Walk the Dog and Light the Light (1993), her last album for Columbia, was co-produced by Gary Katz, best known for his work with Steely Dan. The release sparked reappraisal of her place in popular music, and new commercial offers began appearing. She turned down lucrative film-composing offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the Academy Award-winning documentary Broken Rainbow, about the unjust relocation of the Navajo people.  Nyro performed increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s with female musicians, including her friend Nydia \\"Liberty\\" Mata, a drummer, and several others from the lesbian-feminist women's music subculture, such as members of the band Isis. During this period, Nyro made appearances at such venues as the 1989 Michigan Womyn's Music Festival and the 1989 Newport Folk Festival, of which a CD containing portions of her performance was released. On July 4, 1991, she opened for Bob Dylan at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. Among her last performances were at Union Chapel, Islington, London, England in November 1994; The New York Bottom Line Christmas Eve Show in 1994; and at McCabe's in Los Angeles February 11 and 12, 1995.  Both The Tonight Show and the Late Show with David Letterman staffs heavily pursued Nyro for a TV appearance during this period, yet she turned them down as well, citing her discomfort with appearing on television (she made only a handful of early TV appearances and one fleeting moment on VH-1 performing the title song from Broken Rainbow on Earth Day in 1990). According to producer Gary Katz, she also turned down a request to be the musical guest on the fall 1993 season opener of Saturday Night Live. She never released an official video, although there was talk of filming some The Bottom Line appearances in the 1990s.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" Answer: \\"Anti tanning laws\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, the answer is not entirely accurate. The correct answer would be: \\"Smoking bans in workplaces, bars, and restaurants, as well as other health and safety laws.\\" While the text does mention a ban on teens using tanning booths in California, it does not state that this particular rule has spread throughout the country."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Persian.

The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.  Paragraph: Two neighboring gulfs had different geographical features. South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom? The answer to this question is:","output":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. Step 1: Identify the factors that affect erosion From the background information, we know that waves traveling into shallow water lead to more significant erosion of the ocean bottom. Step 2: Compare the gulfs' geographical features The South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while the North gulf is quite deep. Step 3: Determine erosion based on geographical features Since the South gulf has shallow water, the wave activity in that area will be affected by the ocean bottom, leading to higher and steeper waves, eventually causing more erosion. On the other hand, the North gulf, being deeper, will not be as affected by the ocean bottom, leading to less erosion. Step 4: Conclusion - North gulf experiences less erosion Considering the factors that impact erosion and the geographical features of the two gulfs, the North gulf, with its deeper water, will experience less erosion on the ocean bottom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday. She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be. Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life. The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict. What is the stereotyped role of American women?

Annette McKenzie wants the law changed to prevent under-18s being prescribed medication without parental consent. She said the current system was \\"letting young people down\\". She found out her daughter Britney Mazzoncini had been prescribed Propanol by her GP after she died of an overdose of the tablets in July last year. Ms McKenzie has lodged a petition at the Scottish Parliament. Speaking at the Public Petitions Committee, she said her campaign was not a \\"witch-hunt\\" against the doctor who treated her daughter. \\"When this happened with Britney, yes I was devastated, I was broken, but it also let me find a fault in the system where it is letting young people down,\\" she said. Britney, from Glasgow, suffered from depression and anxiety and was having suicidal impulses. She was prescribed a month's supply of the drug by her doctor last June. Sixteen days later, she took an overdose. Ms McKenzie said she had been unaware of the prescription and had mistaken side-effects, such as tiredness, as her daughter being lazy. She explained to MSPs: \\"My daughter didn't understand at 16 years old the severity and strength of the medication she was given. \\"She went to the doctor that day to ask for help. She didn't go expecting to be given pills.\\" She added: \\"I know a lot of people have concerns that my petition in particular will discourage young people from going to seek help from their doctor. \\"To say that a child won't go to the doctor to ask for help, I don't believe that, because a child at that age isn't going to a doctor to ask for pills, they are going to speak out, to be asked to be helped.\\" GPs do not need to seek parental consent to prescribe medication if the young person is deemed to be able to understand the nature of the treatment and potential consequences of the treatment. Ms McKenzie said the strength and effect of some mental health medications made it important that parents and guardians were \\"fully involved and aware of the circumstances, allowing them to support treatment\\" and safeguard their children by taking control of pills and dispensing them as required. \\"We're not just talking about my daughter being 16 here, we are talking about there being no age of consent,\\" she said. \\"If they deem you to be wise enough, they will send you away with medication.\\" The committee agreed to contact the Scottish government, the Scottish Association for Mental Health, the General Medical Council and a range of other relevant organisations.","output":"A mother is asking for a change in the law so that doctors cannot give medicine to people under 18 without their parents knowing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

By John Hall New York's infamous East River - criticised for years for its high levels of pollution - could house the city's newest public attraction; a floating, cross-shaped public pool filled with filtered river water. Artist impressions have been released showing the stunning pool, which is attached to the Brooklyn shoreline via a floating wooden walkway, floating beneath the famed Manhattan skyline.

Re-establishing communication may clear up any misunderstandings.  However, if you feel that your agent has deliberately lied or misled you about anything you consider material (e.g., the condition of a piece of property, the willingness of a seller or buyer, or the costs of services), you should pursue a complaint. Sometimes what strikes a seller as unprofessional conduct may seem minor to real estate professionals. Discuss your issue with an unbiased third party to gain another perspective. The broker is the party who owes you a fiduciary duty; the agent is merely the broker’s employee. You should therefore set up a meeting and make your complaints known. The agent may or may not be invited to attend.  Write out your complaints and all of the details that you remember. Take down the name of any witnesses as well as their telephone numbers. Practice explaining your complaint. You want to be precise and clear. Be firm but not angry. If you believe the broker violated the contract, take out your copy of the contract and highlight the section you believe has been violated. Although the agent’s manager has access to the contract, the meeting will go more smoothly if you bring as much supporting documentation as possible.  Other important documents include lease contracts, sales receipts, and communications between you and the agent. If you do not want the agent to attend, ask for him or her not to be present.  If possible, you should willingly agree to have the agent at the meeting. Problems can be resolved more quickly if the supervisor or manager has both sides of the story. You can also gently correct any errors the agent makes in describing his side of the story. Apart from merely lodging a complaint against an agent, you can ask the managing broker to resolve your problem. For example, if the agent did not disclose a defect in the house, you could ask for an offsetting reduction in agent fees. Be open to settlement. Accepting less than you want does not mean that you cannot still file a complaint with your state’s licensing board. If you feel the meeting did not go well, ask if there is anyone else you can meet with. In large real estate offices you probably will not meet with the president initially, so there should be someone else to talk to. Ask to move up the chain of command. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the process of addressing difficulties and resolving issues in a relationship with a real estate agent. It emphasizes the importance of re-establishing communication to clear up misunderstandings and recommends seeking an unbiased third party to gain a different perspective.

It's the early 1990s. The company man is helping expose ADM's alleged global price-fixing activities to the FBI, cooperating with the feds long enough to gather invaluable evidence.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.  The play is set in Napoleonic times. Act 1 There is heightened anticipation as the local gossips of the town discuss the developing relationship between Miss Phoebe Throssel and Valentine Brown. Phoebe then confesses to her sister, Susan, that Brown intends to drop by later that day, and both are certain he means to propose. When he finally does appear, it is not to ask for Phoebe's hand in marriage but to announce his intention to join the fight in Europe against Napoleon. This leaves the girls devastated. Act 2 Ten years after the departure of Brown, we find the girls have set up a school in order to pay the rent. Phoebe has not accepted any other suitor and has allowed herself to become an \\"Old Maid\\" and school mistress. Phoebe, however, longs for her youth, and the return of Captain Brown only deepens her melancholy. \\"I am tired of being lady-like,\\" she declares. With some encouragement from her maid, Patty, she creates the fictional character of Miss Livvy, a more energetic, flirtatious and naughty version of her younger self, and begins to tease Captain Brown who, captivated by her, persuades her and Susan to accompany him to the ball. Act 3 At the ball, and Phoebe is still playing the part of Miss Livvy. In this guise, she has captured the eyes of many of the young men and the scorn of ladies. However, Phoebe is now annoyed that Brown seems to prefer this unsubstantial 'young' flirt that she has created to her true personality and qualities. Her actions cause events to come to a head as her act is almost brought to light by the local gossiping girls Fanny Willoughby and Henrietta Turnbull. In a final confrontation with Captain Brown, we discover that he has found his love for Miss Phoebe and not for Miss Livvy, as he insists that \\"I have discovered for myself that the schoolmistress in her old maid's cap is the noblest Miss Phoebe of them all.\\" Act 4 Miss Livvy still hangs heavy over the sisters: having been created, she is now difficult to dispose of. The local gossips watch for any sign of Miss Livvy and frequently visit the sisters' home. Brown comes to ask for Phoebe s hand and is turned down without explanation. As a result, he becomes aware of the disguise and the sisters' plight and sets out to right all wrongs, even his own.","output":"Part #1: Events in the story Usage: Who does Valentine Brown announce his intention to join the fight against?

The special aired again on December 24, 2002 on Channel 4 in the UK. The Birmingham Evening Mail reviewed the show, writing, \\"Criss Angel is currently making a name for himself as a more provocative, darker alternative to [other illusionists]. He walks the streets of New York, hypnotising passers-by, turning cups of take-away coffee into cockroaches and suspending himself from the ceiling by inserting hooks into his back. The piece de resistance of all these mind games is an update of the Houdini underwater trick - an attempt to stay in a (cell) tank of water for 24 hours, padlocked and restrained. All seems to be going well, until the filter system breaks down and the water begins to heat up.\\"  On October 31, 2003 SciFi Channel aired the one-hour special Supernatural starring Angel.

Background: Matthew Fontaine Maury (January 14, 1806 - February 1, 1873) was an American astronomer, United States Navy officer, historian, oceanographer, meteorologist, cartographer, author, geologist, and educator. He was nicknamed \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" and \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\" and later, \\"Scientist of the Seas\\" for his extensive works in his books, especially The Physical Geography of the Sea (1855), the first such extensive and comprehensive book on oceanography to be published. Maury made many important new contributions to charting winds and ocean currents, including ocean lanes for passing ships at sea. Context: Maury was a descendant of the Maury family, a prominent Virginia family of Huguenot ancestry that can be traced back to 15th-century France. His grandfather (the Reverend James Maury) was an inspiring teacher to a future US president, Thomas Jefferson. Maury also had Dutch-American ancestry from the \\"Minor\\" family of early Virginia.  He was born in 1806 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg; his parents were Richard Maury and Diane Minor Maury. The family moved to Franklin, Tennessee, when he was five. He wanted to emulate the naval career of his older brother, Flag Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who, however, caught yellow fever after fighting pirates as an officer in the US Navy. As a result of John's painful death, Matthew's father, Richard, forbade him from joining the Navy. Maury strongly considered attending West Point to get a better education than the Navy could offer at that time, but instead, he obtained a naval appointment through the influence of Tennessee Representative Sam Houston, a family friend, in 1825, at the age of 19.  Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman on board the frigate Brandywine which was carrying the Marquis de La Fayette home to France, following La Fayette's famous visit to the United States. Almost immediately, Maury began to study the seas and to record methods of navigation. One of the experiences that piqued this interest was a circumnavigation of the globe on the USS Vincennes, his assigned ship and the first US warship to travel around the world. Question: What did he do after obtaining naval appointment? Answer:","output":"After obtaining his naval appointment, Matthew Maury joined the Navy as a midshipman. He went on board the ship called Brandywine, which was taking the Marquis de La Fayette back to France after his visit to the United States. During his time in the Navy, Maury started to study the seas and learn about navigation. One of the exciting things he did was travel around the world on a ship called the USS Vincennes, which was the first US warship to make such a trip. This sparked his interest in studying oceans, winds, and currents, which would lead to his important work in oceanography and meteorology."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Q:Information:  - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \\"Punic Wars\\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \\"Poeni\\", derived from \\"Poenici\\" (earlier form of \\"Punici\\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers.  - Clastidium (modern Casteggio), was a village of the Anamares, in Gallia Cispadana, on the Via Postumia, 5 miles east of Iria (modern Voghera) and 31 miles west of Placentia.  - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories.  - Archimedes of Syracuse  was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola.  - Lucius Annaeus Florus (c. 74 AD  c. 130 AD) was a Roman historian who lived in the time of Trajan and Hadrian. He was born in Africa.  - The spolia opima (\\"rich spoils\\") were the armour, arms, and other effects that an ancient Roman general stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. The \\"spolia opima\\" were regarded as the most honourable of the several kinds of war trophies a commander could obtain, including enemy military standards and the peaks of warships.  - Hegemony (or , or  \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE  6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\".  - The Insubres or Insubri were a Gaulish population settled in Insubria, in what is now the Italian region of Lombardy. They were the founders of Mediolanum (Milan). Though completely Gaulish at the time of Roman conquest, they were the result of the fusion of pre-existing Ligurian and Celtic population with Gaulish tribes who had come from what is now Central Europe.  - The Battle of Clastidium was fought in 222 BC between a Roman Republican army led by the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus and the Insubres. Florus tells us that the Insubred were led by Viridomarus, or Britomartus as the name varies in translation. The Romans won the battle, and in the process, Marcellus earned the Spolia opima, one of the highest honors in ancient Rome, by killing the King in single combat.  - Viridomarus or Britomartus as translations vary , ( died 222 BC ) was a Gaulish military leader who led an army against an army of the Roman Republic at the Battle of Clastidium . The Romans won the battle , and in the process , Marcus Claudius Marcellus , the Roman leader , earned the spolia opima by killing Viridomarus in single combat .  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Marcus Claudius Marcellus (c. 268  208 BC), five times elected as consul of the Roman Republic, was an important Roman military leader during the Gallic War of 225 BC and the Second Punic War. Marcellus gained the most prestigious award a Roman general could earn, the spolia opima, for killing the Gallic military leader and king Viridomarus in hand-to-hand combat in 222 BC at the battle of Clastidium. Furthermore, he is noted for having conquered the fortified city of Syracuse in a protracted siege during which Archimedes, the famous inventor, was killed. Marcus Claudius Marcellus died in battle in 208 BC, leaving behind a legacy of military conquests and a reinvigorated Roman legend of the \\"spolia opima\\".  - Single combat is a duel between two single warriors which takes place in the context of a battle between two armies. Often, it is champion warfare, with the two considered the champions of their respective sides. Instances of single combat are known from Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The champions were often combatants who represented larger, spectator groups. Such representative contests and stories thereof are known worldwide.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma.  and the situation: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B.

Plot title: It's a Wonderful Life Movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S.

Thanksgiving travelers told to 'pack your patience' as storm heads for east coast A nor’easter is expected to develop Wednesday along the east coast of the United States just as millions of travelers are heading to their Thanksgiving destinations. “I would pack your patience,” said Robert Sinclair Jr, of AAA New York. The storm, forecast to dump rain along the coast and snow inland, could cause delays at Northeast airports and along its busy highways. Precipitation was forecast to sweep in from the south Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and exit the region Thursday morning. Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said coastal cities are likely to mostly receive rain, although he cautioned Monday afternoon that meteorologists would be keeping a close eye on the rain/snow line. “A small deviation in the track could change things dramatically,” he said. As of Monday, the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Ten inches was possible in some places, forecasters said. Officials at the three major airports in the New York City area — Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were “monitoring weather forecasts carefully,” and were ready to take action if needed, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. Sinclair said an estimated 41.3 million travelers were expected to hit the nation’s highways for the holiday weekend. That’s a 4.3 % increase over last year. Sinclair suggested travelers consider going on Tuesday or Thursday, instead of Wednesday, if they can. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"A nor'easter is expected to bring rain and snow along the east coast of the U.S. on Wednesday, potentially causing delays at Northeast airports and busy highways just as millions of Thanksgiving travelers head to their destinations.

Tom is also dealing with flashbacks from his combat service as an Army Captain in both the European and Pacific theaters, involving men that he killed (including, by accident, his best friend), and a young Italian girl named Maria, with whom he had a brief but heartfelt affair in Italy despite his being in a relationship with Betsy at the time.

Article: Speaking two languages can actually help offset  some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive  task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual  , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Options: A: Researchers found that speaking two languages is important. B: Researchers found that bilingual people respond slowly.

Closing in on a planet, the ship is attacked by a mysterious weapon (a red blobby field) which drives the crew insane. Three escape pods launch during the attack, but the ship crashes into the atmosphere of the planet and is destroyed. Meanwhile, smuggler Stella Star and her sidekick Akton run into the Imperial Space Police, led by robot sheriff Elle. Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who tracked their hyperspace trail.

When a riot breaks out at Stella's prison, she uses the diversion to escape the prison, which explodes shortly afterwards. Police Chief Thor recaptures her and she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton.

By Emma Innes PUBLISHED: 07:01 EST, 29 April 2013 | UPDATED: 10:22 EST, 29 April 2013 A father-of-one who has survived cancer three times has described himself as the 'luckiest, unlucky' person alive. John Willis, 37, has battled testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers all in just three years. Miraculously, he has survived each one. John Willis (pictured with his wife Angela) has had testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers Incredibly, the stomach cancer was not related to the lymph node and testicular cancers, meaning that he developed two completely unconnected cancers. Professor Karol Sikora, a world renown oncologist, told MailOnline that the chances of being diagnosed with two different forms of cancer in a year is one in a million. Mr","output":"Willis, a factory worker from Manchester, was first diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2010 after discovering a lump on his testicle during a self-examination. He underwent surgery to remove the cancerous testicle and received chemotherapy to ensure any remaining cells were eradicated. His wife Angela, 35, a nurse, supported him throughout the treatment, and they were overjoyed when doctors declared him cancer-free later that year. In 2011, however, John started experiencing severe stomach pain, and after numerous tests, doctors sadly informed him that he had stomach cancer. This shocked the family, as it was not related to the previous testicular cancer and considered incredibly rare and unlucky. John once again bravely embraced the challenge, receiving a series of radiation therapy sessions and an aggressive surgery to remove the affected part of his stomach. Following the surgery and additional treatment, John was in remission by mid-2012, which was a great relief to the family, who hoped that their cancer battles were over. Unfortunately, tragedy struck again in 2013, when John began experiencing persistent pain and swelling in his neck. Further tests confirmed lymph node cancer. He was referred to Professor Sikora, who quickly devised a personalized and aggressive treatment plan, combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite the odds stacked against him, John managed to beat cancer for the third time in just three years, aided by his indomitable spirit and the unwavering support of his wife Angela and their 10-year-old son, Charlie. Upon hearing of John's incredible journey, a local charity organized a Family Fun Day event to celebrate his success and raise funds for a much-needed family vacation. The Willis family were able to finally enjoy some well-deserved relaxation on an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World in Florida. In an interview, John expressed his gratitude for overcoming these tough challenges and credited his recovery to the support he received from his family and the medical professionals who worked tirelessly to treat him. \\"I consider myself the luckiest, unlucky person alive,\\" he said. \\"Without the love and support of my wife and son, I wouldn't have been able to get through this ordeal. I owe my life to them, as well as to the incredible medical staff who never gave up on me, even when things seemed impossible.\\" Aware of the importance of early detection and the power of resilience, John now dedicates his spare time to visiting hospitals and support groups, sharing his story and giving hope to other cancer patients. He also actively participates in events and fundraises for local cancer charities, as well as national organizations such as Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK, using his experience to help others going through similar battles. In a statement, Professor Sikora praised John's tenacity and perseverance. \\"John's ability to overcome not one but three different types of cancer in such a short time is truly remarkable,\\" he said. \\"His case serves as a testament to the importance of early detection and treatment, as well as the incredible power of the human spirit to endure and triumph in the face of seemingly insurmountable adversity.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.

As Julie kept asking question after question, all I could think of was how desperately I needed a normal, healthy relationship. As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \\"I don't understand, Dingo.\\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling.

He is the younger brother of German international Mats Hummels, and the son of Hermann Hummels, a former footballer and manager. Can we infer the following? Jonas has one or more siblings.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Jonas Hummels has at least one sibling. His brother, Mats Hummels, is a German international football player. It is worth noting that the given information does not reveal if Jonas has any other siblings apart from Mats. While it is possible that he might have more siblings, we cannot confirm it from the data provided. It is clear, however, that Jonas is a part of a football family, as his father Hermann Hummels is also a former footballer and manager. This suggests that football has been a significant aspect of Jonas' life, and his decision to pursue a career in football was likely influenced by his family's passion for the sport.  Jonas Hummels was born on August 5th, 1990, and followed in the footsteps of his father and brother by playing as a central defender. He played professionally for SpVgg Unterhaching, a German football club based in Unterhaching, a suburb of Munich. Although he may not have achieved the same level of international success as his brother Mats, Jonas still made his own mark in the world of football. Mats Hummels, born on December 16th, 1988, is a highly accomplished professional football player known for his performances with both the German national team and domestic clubs, such as Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. With a career spanning over a decade, Mats has gained recognition as one of the top central defenders in Europe. He has won numerous domestic and international titles and has played a significant role in the success of his teams. Hermann Hummels, the father of Jonas and Mats, has also had a notable career in the football industry. He was a former football player and then transitioned into a managerial role, with experience not only in guiding and developing talent on the field but also in dealing with the organizational and strategic aspects of football clubs. This strong football background of the Hummels family demonstrates their immense passion for the sport and shows how football has been an influential part of their lives. In conclusion, based on the information provided, we can infer that Jonas Hummels has at least one sibling—his brother Mats Hummels, a renowned German international football player. The Hummels family is deeply rooted in the world of football, with both Jonas and Mats following in their father Hermann's footsteps and pursuing successful careers within the sport."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Harshing on Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire (Lionsgate Films), the awkwardly titled Lee Daniels adaptation of an \\"urban fiction\\" best-seller, makes a critic feel almost as mean-spirited as Mary, the monstrously abusive mother of the film's eponymous heroine. Parked in front of the TV in the grim Harlem walk-up they share, Mary (played with a fearsome lack of vanity by stand-up comedian Mo'Nique) pelts her 16-year-old daughter, Claireece Precious Jones (Gabourey Sidibe), with cruel insults, imperious commands, and, whenever possible, heavy airborne objects. \\"I ain't done nothin'!\\" Precious protests, and the movie is at pains to prove her right: For the first hour at least, Precious is less a person who does things than an object to which things are done. Her absentee father, seen only once in a nauseating flashback sequence, rapes her on a regular basis; at 16, she's pregnant with his second child. Her daughter, who has Down syndrome, lives with a coldly disapproving grandmother; their visits last just long enough to fool the welfare inspector into issuing Mary's next check. In addition to being obese, unloved, and dirt-poor, Precious is also illiterate, though the public school she attends is so bad that she's managed to camouflage that fact through the eighth grade. In short, this girl's life is so abysmal that you feel the least you can do is like the movie she's in.      It's not that there isn't anything to like about Precious, which at its best resembles its heroine: observant, large-spirited, and brave. The director, Lee Daniels (Shadowboxer), puts on his hip boots and wades into grimmer territory than any recent film I can think of, and his fearless leading ladies, Mo'Nique and Sidibe, wade right in with him. But Daniels' methodical commitment to abjection, his need to shove the reality of Precious' life in our faces and wave it around till we acknowledge its awfulness, winds up robbing the audience (and, to some extent, the actors) of all agency. Daniels is not above cutting from an image of incestuous rape to a shot of greasy pork sizzling on the stove: Her father treats her like meat, get it? In its eagerness to drag us through the lower depths of human experience, Precious leaves no space for the audience to breathe or to draw our own conclusions. For a film about empowerment and self-actualization, it wields an awfully large cudgel.      Precious is expelled from school when the news of her second pregnancy comes out, but the principal refers her to an alternative learning center, Each One Teach One, where an impossibly beautiful and patient teacher named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) leads a reading and writing workshop for dropout girls. Ms. Rain is an emissary from another world, where slender, caring, soft-spoken women (Ms. Rain, as it turns out, is a lesbian) sip wine and play Scrabble and, in Precious' words, \\"talk like TV channels I don't watch.\\" Precious' ability to read and write keeps pace with her growing belly as she slowly learns to trust Ms. Rain and her raucous, foulmouthed, but closeknit classmates. (All the Each One Teach One girls are deftly sketched and well-cast, as is an exasperated social worker played with surprising finesse by Mariah Carey.) But when Precious' baby finally arrives, she's forced to depend once more on her toxic disaster of a mother. As Precious carries the fragile newborn into that awful apartment, you want to rush the screen and lock her out to keep them safe, and the scene that follows shamelessly exploits that protective impulse. I don't like when children are used as decoys to lure a movie audience into a trap.      Advertisement            Seeded throughout Precious are brief dream sequences in which the stolidly joyless heroine imagines herself as a performer in a music video, a movie star on the red carpet, etc. Whether these are meant to be critiques of a mass culture that trades in escapist fantasy or simply pathos-ridden glimpses into Precious' impoverished mental life is never clear. But like the outlandish badness of the mother character, the overdetermined tawdriness of these scenes does the movie and its heroine a disservice. Daniels and his screenwriter, Geoffrey Fletcher, are so eager to wring uplift from Precious' story that they're willing to manipulate us to get it. Daniels and Fletcher no doubt intended for their film to lend a voice to the kind of protagonist too often excluded from American movie screens: a poor, black, overweight single mother from the inner city. But in offering up their heroine's misery for the audience's delectation, they've created something uncomfortably close to poverty porn.

Written by Geoffrey Fletcher, based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Running time: 109 minutes. Rated R (for child abuse, including sexual assault, and pervasive language).            Printer-friendly »      E-mail this to a friend »      Precious has shut down. She avoids looking at people, she hardly ever speaks, she's nearly illiterate. Inside her lives a great hurt, and also her child, conceived in a rape. She is fat. Her clothes are too tight. School is an ordeal of mocking cruelty. Home is worse. Her mother, defeated by life, takes it out on her daughter. After Precious is raped by her father, her mother, is angry not at the man, but at the child for \\"stealing\\" him.      There's one element in the film that redeems this landscape of despair. That element is hope. Not the hope of Precious, but that of two women who want better for her. It's not that Precious \\"shows promise.\\" I think it's that these women, having in their jobs seen a great deal, can hardly imagine a girl more obviously in pain.            That is the starting point for \\"Precious,\\" a great American film that somehow finds an authentic way to move from these beginnings to an inspiring ending. Gabourey \\"Gabby\\" Sidibe, a young actress in her debut performance as Precious, says, \\"I know this girl. I know her in my family, I know her in my friends, I've seen her, I've lived beside this girl.\\"            We may have seen her, too, if we looked. People often don't really look. They see, evaluate, dismiss.            Sidibe is heartbreaking as Precious, that poor girl. Three other actresses perform so powerfully in the film that academy voters will be hard-pressed to choose among them. Audiences may be hard-pressed to recognize them. The comedian Mo'Nique plays Mary, Precious' chain-smoking couch potato of a mother, treating her daughter like a domestic servant and turning a blind eye on years of abuse. Paula Patton is Ms. Rain, Precious' teacher, who is able to see through the girl's sullen withdrawal and her vulgarities, and wonder what pain it may be masking. Mariah Carey is Ms. Weiss, a social worker.            This casting looks almost cynical on paper, as if reflecting old Hollywood days when stars were slipped into \\"character roles\\" with a wink. But Lee Daniels, the director, didn't cast them for their names, and actually doesn't use any of their star qualities. He requires them to act. Somehow he was able to see beneath the surface and trust that they had within the emotional resources to play these women, and he was right. Daniels began his career by producing \\"Monster's Ball,\\" in which Halle Berry shed her glamour and found such depths that she won an Oscar. Daniels must have an instinct for performances waiting to flower.            Carey and Patton are equal with Sidibe in screen impact; the film holds the girl in the center of their attempt to save her future. Why would a teacher and a social worker go to such lengths to intervene? They must see tragic victims of abuse every day.            Mary, the mother, is perhaps not a bad woman but simply one defeated by the forces she now employs against her daughter. Mo'Nique is frighteningly convincing.            The film is a tribute to Sidibe's ability to engage our empathy. Her work is still another demonstration of the mystery of some actors, who evoke feelings in ways beyond words and techniques. She so completely creates the Precious character that you rather wonder if she's very much like her.            You meet Sidibe, who is engaging, outgoing and 10 years older than her character, and you're almost startled. She's not at all like Precious, but in her first performance, she not only understands this character but knows how to make her attract the sympathy of her teacher, the social worker -- and ourselves. I don't know how she does it but there you are.            My interview with “Gabby” Sidibe. ||||| Precious Is the Diary of a Sad Black Woman Pushing the limits of taste, but locating the heart—and hell—of its heroine's struggle      In her broad outlines, Claireece Precious Jones risks sounding like the epitome of ghetto cliché: an obese, illiterate 16-year-old; mother to a four-year-old Down syndrome daughter and now pregnant again; physically and psychologically abused by her mother; repeatedly raped by her father, who is, also, the father of her own two children. Precious—as she prefers to be called—is the central figure in the poet Sapphire's bestselling 1996 novel Push, an homage of sorts to The Color Purple (which it directly references and also mirrors in its diaristic style), set in the pre-gentrification Harlem of the mid-1980s. And it's a testament to Sapphire's affecting prose (written in Precious's own words and dialect) that her protagonist emerges as something more than a mere statistic or representative—that we understand how Precious's story is, for all its commonalities with other abused black women, uniquely her own.      Director Lee Daniels's film adaptation (which has been retitled Precious since its Sundance premiere, and also acquired two high-profile \\"presenters\\" in Tyler Perry and Oprah) is a somewhat blunter, but nevertheless effective object. Working from screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher's faithful adaptation, Daniels cultivates an aesthetic that is often more grotesque than artful, sometimes artfully grotesque (like a Courbet painting), and rarely delivered with less than a sledgehammer thwack. Bleak though it was on the page, the apartment shared by Precious (newcomer Gabourey Sidibe) and her layabout welfare mother, Mary (Mo'Nique), here appears like a Lenox Avenue Grey Gardens, with a television perpetually tuned to The 100,000 Pyramid and curtains that don't seem to have parted since whatever decade Mary last left the premises. When Daniels flashes back to Precious's horrifying rapes, the wide-angle close-ups of her father's heaving body, and of fried chicken sizzling on the stove, feel like outtakes from one of Rudy Ray Moore's outré blaxploitation farces (or from Daniels's own risible, little-seen debut feature, Shadowboxer, featuring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as oedipal hired assassins). And when Precious enrolls at the alternative school where a teacher improbably named Blu Rain (Paula Patton) inspires her to stand and deliver, the classrooms are wreathed in ethereal light.      Hothouse melodrama one moment, kitchen-sink (and frying-pan-to-the-head) realism the next, with eruptions of incongruous slapstick throughout, this may be Daniels's stab at finding a cinematic analog for the novel's inventive, naïf-art language—a film style, like Precious's writing style, seemingly being made up as it goes along. Yet even when the movie is at its most schizoid, Precious still packs a wallop. What Daniels lacks as a craftsman, he makes up for in his willingness to put the lives of abused and defeated black women on the screen with brute-force candor and a lack of sentimentality. Where Push the novel echoed The Color Purple the novel, Precious the movie operates as something of a corrective to Steven Spielberg's 1985 film, with its narrative sanitizing and artery-clogging Quincy Jones score. Its own inspirational touches notwithstanding (not for nothing did it cop the audience awards at Sundance and Toronto earlier this year), Precious is less about overcoming adversity than about survival—a battle the movie does not begin to pretend can be won in two hours of screen time. No slumdog millionaires here, Daniels's movie puts us through hell—Precious's hell—and leaves us somewhere like limbo.      A former casting director, Daniels shows undeniable savoir faire with his actors, a mix of musicians and comedians effectively cast against type, from a dark-haired, deglamorized Mariah Carey as a tough-love social worker to a subtle Lenny Kravitz as an attentive male nurse. The picture belongs, however, to the gale-force Mo'Nique, who transforms an ostensibly one-note monster mom into a complex portrait of a psychologically damaged woman (no matter that Daniels seems to have edited her most showstopping scene in a blender), and to the magnanimous Sidibe, who carries the alternately exhausting and exhilarating narrative on her formidable shoulders. For most of the movie, her stoically beautiful face stays wrought tight in a mask of sadness and self-loathing. When she relaxes those muscles ever so slightly—one of the movie's few subtle touches—it is like a weight of centuries has been lifted. ||||| Summary:","output":"\\"Precious,\\" directed by Lee Daniels, is a film adaptation of the bestselling novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire, which provides a harrowing coming-of-age story set in pre-gentrification Harlem in the 1980s. The film follows the difficult life of 16-year-old Claireece Precious Jones, played by Gabourey Sidibe, who endures physical and psychological abuse and extreme poverty. The movie powerfully portrays her experiences with abuse, illiteracy, and overcoming adversity while attending an alternative school led by teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton). Director Daniels has a unique approach to blending the genres of melodrama and realism, which can occasionally feel disjointed but still leaves a significant impact. The film is driven by strong performances from actors like Mo'Nique, who plays Precious's abusive mother Mary, as well as Mariah Carey, who portrays a social worker named Ms. Weiss. The film challenges the audience's preconceptions about those living in similar circumstances and emphatically shows the struggle to survive in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A teenager who became the youngest person in Britain to have a full sex change is hoping to be crowned Miss England. After four suicide attempts, Jackie Green, 18, from Leeds, underwent surgery to become a woman on her 16th birthday. Ever since she was a toddler, Jackie - who was. born a boy and named Jack - always acted like a girl. and insisted on wearing feminine clothes and playing with girls’ toys. Teenage dreams: Jackie Green, pictured on TV show Lorraine Live today, hopes to be crowned Miss England just two years after she underwent a full sex change operation. Her parents came to terms with the. fact she was really a girl trapped inside a boy’s body and spent, in. total, £28,000 on her treatment. At her lowest point, the teenager even threatened to cut off her own genitals with a knife. Now Jackie has her sights set on a model future as she dreams of a place in the Miss England semi-finals. She said: 'It’s a little strange because there are so many other really gorgeous girls in the competition. 'It would be amazing to win and I just hope it makes other people see that there is a lot more to life than getting bullied.' New life: Jackie Green was the youngest person in Britain to undergo a sex change two years ago. Prayers answered: Jackie, pictured just before surgery, had her operation on her 16th birthday in Thailand. She added: 'When I was younger I never really. had anyone else to look up to in the same position. I would have never. imagined this, not in a million years.' Her supportive mother Susie added: 'If she went on to win I would be very proud of her. 'She has stuck herself out there and knew she would get flak for it. Some comments on websites haven’t. been very kind but she is aware of that and thinks why should that stop. me, I’m the same as anyone else.' Jackie is currently leading the public vote in her heat of the popular beauty contest. When she was Jack: Jackie, pictured with her mother Susie (left) , knew she was a girl trapped in a boy's body from an early age. She now dreams of following in the footsteps of Miss England 2011 Alize Mounter (right) The top three will then go through to a. judging panel before a lucky model is given the coveted spot in the. semi-finals of Miss England. A spokesman for the competition said: 'There's not much we could do legally to stop her entering. 'We did agonise over it, but as she is a woman she fits the bill and is an affable young lady.' Jackie underwent a seven-hour sex change operation in Thailand, where under 18s can have the surgery, two years ago. After years of bullying and torment, she now claims to lead a normal life and has a boyfriend.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question below:   As a balloon deflates there is more or less air pressure forcing air out?    Assuming that:  Exhaling, or breathing out, decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. The answer to this question is:","output":"As a balloon deflates, there is more air pressure forcing air out.  To understand this concept, let's first examine the basic principles of gas and air pressure. A balloon is made of a stretchable material, usually rubber or mylar, which is filled with a certain amount of air or gas. When you inflate a balloon, you are increasing the volume of its interior while keeping the number of gas molecules constant. As the volume of the interior space grows, the gas molecules inside become more widely dispersed and thereby exert less pressure on the inner walls of the balloon. In other words, when a balloon inflates, the internal air pressure decreases as the volume increases. Now let's discuss what happens when you deflate a balloon. Deflating a balloon means releasing the air or gas trapped inside, which results in a reduction of the interior volume. As the volume shrinks, the gas molecules inside the balloon become more densely packed. This higher concentration of gas molecules increases the frequency at which they collide with the inner walls of the balloon, resulting in an increase in air pressure. The air pressure inside the balloon becomes greater than the external air pressure, which creates a force that pushes the air or gas out of the balloon. Deflating a balloon can be further understood in the context of Boyle's Law. Boyle's Law states that the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely proportional to one another when the temperature and the number of gas molecules remain constant. In the case of a deflating balloon, as its volume decreases, the pressure inside increases, which is in accordance with Boyle's Law. This relationship explains why there is more air pressure forcing air out when a balloon deflates. Returning to your assumption about exhaling, one can draw a parallel with the deflating balloon. When exhaling, the size of the chest cavity decreases, causing an increase in the pressure inside the lungs. This increase in pressure forces the air out of the lungs and into the atmosphere, similar to the process that occurs when a balloon deflates. In summary, as a balloon deflates, there is more air pressure forcing air out due to the reduction in the interior volume, the increased concentration of gas molecules, and the application of Boyle's Law, which explains the inverse relationship between pressure and volume in a gas. This greater internal air pressure is responsible for pushing the air or gas out of the balloon, comparable to the process of exhaling in the human body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Why did the state hospital refuse to practice surgeon for Ziad Matouk? A) Because he couldn't afford the fee at a public hospital. B) Because the hospital didn't accept dangerous patients. C) Because they couldn't find a matched organ. D) Because his condition was untreatable.

If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain  through organs  According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill.

Years and at least 30million later, the project will finally break ground in 2015, though it was originally slated for completion in 2012.","output":"Title: The Remarkable Discovery of the Bracken Cave Meshweaver: An Environmental Mystery in the Heart of San Antonio In 2012, in the midst of energetic construction work on a bustling highway in the San Antonio area, a surprising discovery brought all operations to a standstill. Buried deep within the earth revealed by the construction was a cave – a hidden kingdom that was the home of an extraordinarily rare creature: a Bracken Cave Meshweaver. The Bracken Cave Meshweaver, a dime-sized, nearly translucent arachnid, was a species only seen once before in the annals of biological history. Unveiled from its obscurity by the churn of bulldozers and excavators, the discovery of this elusive creature in the heart of San Antonio was a significant and unexpected event for the world of biology.  The presence of the Meshweaver led to a sudden, almost dramatic, halt in construction activity. The gaze of the scientific world was drawn at once to this small area in San Antonio, and biologists, declaring the area a site of significant biological interest, promptly ordered the cave to be sealed off from human interference. A remarkable process followed the Meshweaver's rediscovery. Construction work was suspended indefinitely, and the contract was duly terminated. The inconspicuous arachnid had unwittingly disrupted an extensive highway project, and the protection of its habitat was given priority over infrastructural progress.  The unexpected intervention of Mother Nature, replete with its challenges, naturally came at a cost. Fast forward to 2015, the standstill had continued for years and had, by experts' estimates, cost at least 30 million. Nonetheless, with comprehensive biological surveys conducted and stringent protection measures put in place for the cave-dwelling creature, the highway project was finally prepped to break ground. The entire episode leading to the grand resumption signified a triumph of nature conservation but also highlighted the incompatibilities that surfaces between infrastructural development and biodiversity preservation. The highway project's original timeline had slated it for completion in 2012. However, the extraordinary find pushed this target forward by three years.  The case of the Bracken Cave Meshweaver is a potent illustration of how the balance between human ambition and biological preservation can be disrupted and the fallout that can arise from such instances. The discovery underlined the crucial need to incorporate environmental considerations and biodiversity audits within the planning stages of infrastructure projects. In the middle of urban San Antonio, the almost translucent, dime-sized arachnid gained an unexpected relevance. The Meshweaver, lying oblivious to its profound impact, serves as a symbol – a tangible reminder of the unseen biodiversity that thrives within our often-overlooked underground biospheres.  The Meshweaver's journey from an obscure cave-dweller to a significant influencer in the world of construction and infrastructure indeed paints a captivating tale of the interesting discoveries that can exist beneath the surface. It essentially makes a strong case for a science-led approach in development planning, to better identify and mitigate such environmental surprises, prioritize species protection, and effectively balance in our march towards progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He becomes the first person to ever complete the Trinity Great Court run: running around the court in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12. Abrahams achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a famous Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil (Alice Krige).Meanwhile in Scotland, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. But Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.Abrahams and Liddell meet for the first time in London in June 1923 when they first race against each other in a British open. Liddell beats Abrahams who takes it extremely badly. But Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm), a professional trainer whom Abrahams had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters (John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson). In their meeting with Abrahams, the Cambridge masters allege it is ungentlemanly for an amateur to \\"play the tradesman\\" by employing a professional coach.

Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them. But when his former associate Sloane is found dead – accidentally having choked to death on the gag Gregory placed in his mouth – they refuse to offer him any assistance, as he is now too \\"hot\\". With the manhunt rapidly closing in, he tries to escape with the help of Bridget Howard, a disillusioned ex-débutante and niece of a Chief Constable. She drives Gregory to a deserted cottage near her family's home in rural Wales. While in hiding, he witnesses the police arrive to question Bridget, assumes the worst, and flees again. Attempting to steal a farmer's bicycle, he is shot in the shoulder. He drives away in a stolen truck but crashes and passes out, where he is found by another farmer. Bridget tells the police nothing. She waits in vain for Gregory at the cottage, then walks into the distance.  Guess a valid title for it!

Information:  - Christian Schad ( August 21 , 1894 -- February 25 , 1982 ) was a German painter associated with Dada and the New Objectivity movement . Considered as a group , Schad 's portraits form an extraordinary record of life in Vienna and Berlin in the years following World War I.  - George Grosz (July 26, 1893  July 6, 1959) was a German artist known especially for his caricatural drawings and paintings of Berlin life in the 1920s. He was a prominent member of the Berlin Dada and New Objectivity group during the Weimar Republic. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, and became a naturalized citizen in 1938. Abandoning the style and subject matter of his earlier work, he exhibited regularly and taught for many years at the Art Students League of New York. In 1956 he returned to Berlin where he died.  - The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit.  As these artistswho included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, and George Groszrejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism.  - Max Beckmann (February 12, 1884  December 27, 1950) was a German painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, and writer. Although he is classified as an Expressionist artist, he rejected both the term and the movement. In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity (\\"Neue Sachlichkeit\\"), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism.    What is the relationship between 'christian schad' and 'expressionism'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Christian Schad was a German painter who was associated with the Dada and New Objectivity movements, rather than with Expressionism. Although Expressionism and New Objectivity were both significant art movements in Germany during the early 20th century, they had contrasting styles and philosophies. Expressionism focused on the artist's subjective emotions and experiences, often using distorted and exaggerated imagery to evoke an emotional response in the viewer. In contrast, the New Objectivity movement, with which Christian Schad was associated, emerged as a reaction against Expressionism. Artists within the New Objectivity, like Schad, rejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the Expressionists, instead opting for a more realistic and objective representation of their subjects, often addressing social and political themes. While Schad's work did not fall under the Expressionist movement, his career and artistic style were influenced by the broader cultural and artistic environment in Germany at the time. Schad's portraits, which form an extraordinary record of life in Vienna and Berlin in the years following World War I, demonstrate his commitment to accurately depicting the world and people around him, thus aligning more closely with the New Objectivity movement than with Expressionism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady.

Write a title for this article: SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg wants Hillary Clinton to be president and has no complaints about the former secretary of state’s style, even if it doesn’t include the classic DVF wrap dress. “I hope that Hillary runs and I hope that she becomes president,” von Furstenberg said in an interview at the Lead On Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women, wearing sunglasses and one of her signature dresses. “If Hillary is running I will definitely be helping her.” Von Furstenberg, 68, is member of the board of the Clinton-founded Vital Voices, a stalwart Democratic donor and a longtime Clinton loyalist. She shifted her support to Barack Obama after Clinton lost the Democratic primary, but her admiration for Clinton never faded. “She has a wonderful sense of fashion for herself.” “I think she is a very attractive woman. I think she has beautiful skin, beautiful smile, beautiful eyes,” von Furstenberg said. “She’s a woman of substance, you know, and how can you judge her hair and her clothes when she goes on—as secretary of state she goes on all the time? I mean, nobody would do that to a man. I mean, what is that? She has a wonderful sense of fashion for herself. She has a wonderful sense of the woman that she is and it’s all about the substance and it’s all about the honesty and it’s all about the truth.” During her 2008 presidential bid and her time in the State Department, Clinton relied on oft-mocked pantsuits, which aren’t a part of von Furstenberg’s fashion vocabulary. Still, the designer approves. “She likes it. It’s comfortable to her and that’s all that matters,” she said. “I love her. She’s a wonderful, formidable woman. She gets better, better with age.” And her advice to other women in politics who may struggle with balancing style and seriousness is to follow Clinton’s lead. “I think that they should just be true to themselves. Be their style and whatever they are and it’s the substance. Take advantage of it—you can have a color,” she said. “[Men] can’t have a color. So use that.

A:","output":"A: Linga stones, also known as lingam or Shiva linga, are abstract symbols predominantly associated with the Hindu god, Lord Shiva. The term \\"linga\\" is derived from the Sanskrit term \\"lingam,\\" which means \\"a symbol or sign.\\" These stones are revered as sacred and symbolize the divine, creative energy of Lord Shiva, who is considered one of the three major deities within the Hindu pantheon, alongside Brahma and Vishnu. The symbolism of Shiva linga is multifaceted and holds deep spiritual significance in Hinduism. Here are some of its various meanings and associations: 1. Formlessness and Infinity: The linga stones typically represent the formless aspect of Lord Shiva, manifesting the idea that the divine transcends all physical forms. This notion underlies the Hindu belief that everything originates from the formless and eventually returns to it. In this context, the linga is often said to represent the infinite nature of the universe. 2. Creation and Cosmic Energy: Another key aspect of linga stones is their association with the process of creation. According to Hindu tradition, the universe is cyclically created, maintained, and destroyed by the cosmic dance performed by Lord Shiva. By symbolizing his creative energy in the form of linga stones, they signify the continuing process of life and creation. 3. Union of Masculine and Feminine Energies: The Shiva linga is also interpreted as a symbol of the union of masculine (Shiva) and feminine (Shakti) energies. This fusion is considered essential in maintaining the balance of the universe. The base structure on which the linga stone rests is called the yoni, representing the goddess Shakti. This symbolic union signifies the interdependence of both energies in the cosmic cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. 4. Fertility and Life Force: The linga stones are often associated with fertility and the life force, owing to the phallic shape of the stone. In ancient times, it was believed that the linga and yoni signified the life-generating and life-sustaining powers of the universe. Their worship was aimed at gaining blessings for creation, abundance, and fertility in life. 5. Spiritual Energy and Meditation: In certain spiritual practices and meditative techniques, the Shiva linga serves as a focal point for concentration and heightened spiritual energy. It is believed that meditating on the linga can bring one closer to the divine and help in the attainment of a higher state of consciousness. Linga stones are not only central to Hinduism but are also found in the Jain and Buddhist traditions. However, they hold the most prominence within the Shaivism sect of Hinduism, which focuses specifically on the worship of Lord Shiva. In conclusion, the Shiva linga or linga stones are sacred symbols deeply associated with Lord Shiva, representing his formless, creative, and cosmic energies. These abstract symbols hold profound spiritual significance in Hinduism, reflecting the infinite, creative nature of the divine, the union of masculine and feminine energies, and the life-generating powers of the universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"The premise under discussion states, \\"It is uncertain what impact this assumption will have on net changes in surplus.\\" By examining this statement, it becomes clear that it explicitly notes uncertainty surrounding how the assumption will affect the net changes in surplus. This means that the effects or implications that this assumption will have on the surplus are presently unclear, ambiguous, or hard to predict with confidence.  On to the hypothesis in question: \\"The assumptions will have a major impact on surplus\\". Here, the hypothesis foregrounds a direct, large, and significant influence of the assumptions on the surplus. It emphasizes a decisive and considerable level of impact that would nominally expect to be observable and identifiable. Let's compare the premise and the hypothesis: the premise conveys uncertainty (i.e., a lack of sureness) in the impact, while the hypothesis proclaims a major impact. Both statements are conversing on the same theme - the effect of the assumption on the surplus.  However, they approach it differently: one denotes uncertainty, the other proclaims definitiveness. To extrapolate the hypothesis from the premise is to suggest certainty where only uncertainty is expressed. Therefore, the correct answer is (B). it is not possible to tell. The premise, stating uncertainty about the impact, does not provide enough information to definitively support or refute the hypothesis that suggests a major and decisive impact. There's a possible situation that the assumption could greatly affect the surplus, and it's also possible that the effects might be minor or negligible. Without more explicit information, we cannot determine which is the case. So 'it is not possible to tell' whether the stated premise entails the given hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Tacky decorations from Oriental Trading: This indicates that the wedding decorations were inexpensive and low-cost. 2. Reception held at the community center: Hosting a wedding at a community center is usually more affordable than renting a private venue. 3. Reception lasting for 45 minutes with punch and snacks: This is a short duration for a reception, and only serving punch, mixed nuts, and mints suggests cost-saving measures were taken with regard to food and beverages. 4. A non-alcoholic toast: Not serving alcohol also reduces the expenses associated with the wedding. 5. Guests watch the bride and groom open their presents: This might indicate the lack of professional entertainment at the event, which can be an expense. After examining the factors listed above, it is clear that the wedding's budget was likely limited or lower than average.

Options: - pool hall - mediterranean sea - seafood restaurant - gulf of mexico - south pacific  Explain why a human would choose \\"mediterranean sea\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"Mediterranean Sea\\" to answer the question above because it is the most logical and plausible option among the choices provided. Here's an explanation for each option: 1. Pool hall: This is not a feasible answer as sharks are marine creatures and cannot be found in a pool hall, which is typically an indoor gaming facility for playing billiards or pool. 2. Mediterranean Sea: This is the correct answer because it is the only option representing a natural body of water in which sharks, particularly certain species such as the great white shark and shortfin mako shark, can be found. Furthermore, Greece is a country located in southeastern Europe, and it borders the Mediterranean Sea. So, if you were Greek and saw a shark while swimming or boating, it would likely be in the Mediterranean Sea. 3. Seafood restaurant: While seafood restaurants do serve dishes made from fish or other marine creatures, including sharks, you would not encounter a live shark inside a restaurant. The context of the question implies you are encountering a live shark, making this option incorrect. 4. Gulf of Mexico: This location is ruled out as an option because it is far away from Greece and not connected to the Mediterranean Sea.

Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her.

Movie title: Undisputed II: Last Man Standing Context: Visiting the Russian Federation for a series of boxing matches, George \\"Iceman\\" Chambers is subsequently framed for possession of cocaine and sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of illegal full-contact Mixed Martial Arts matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. He initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by a crippled inmate, Crot (Eli Danker). Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's friends force George's cellmate, Steven, who is acting as his cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Steven slips the drugged water into Chambers' mouth and he takes a few sips. During the second round, he starts to lose his focus and begins taking more and more punishment until Boyka knocks him out with a devastating flying kick. Following the fight, Steven kills himself out of guilt.After the fight, Chambers (having learnt of the truth from Crot) confronts Boyka, believing that he was responsible for drugging him, and the warden, for going back on the deal.

Here is a question about this article: Because the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n–p–n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent p–n–p transistor. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications. What is the answer to this question: What are common applications of HEMT?","output":"A HEMT, or high-electron-mobility transistor, is a special type of transistor that is really good at working very fast with very little noise. This makes them perfect for jobs where they need to deal with high frequencies.

Please answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Bad characters Review: The characters are all woefully underdeveloped, even the hero of the book. The action scenes are passable, but the plot is sloppy. Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt? Here's hoping the author gets better as the books continue. Not that I will be reading them (to my kid). Even for children, life's too short to read bad books; there are too many better ones to switch to. Answer: Answer:","output":"The overall tone of the product review is negative. Analyzing the reviewer's comments, we can observe several key elements that provide evidence for this conclusion. 1. Character Development: The reviewer expresses that \\"the characters are all woefully underdeveloped,\\" which implies dissatisfaction with the depth and complexity of the characters in the book. By using the term \\"woefully,\\" they emphasize their disappointment in this aspect. 2. Remark on the hero: The mention of even the hero being underdeveloped creates an expectation that, as the protagonist, the hero would be more developed than the other characters. This further emphasizes the reviewer's negative viewpoint on the overall character development. 3. Action Scenes and Plot: While the reviewer acknowledges that the action scenes are \\"passable,\\" they immediately follow this statement with criticism about the \\"sloppy\\" plot. This reveals that, though there may be some adequate aspects in the book, the reviewer still finds significant flaws that overshadow any potential positives. 4. Questioning the Publishing Decision: The reviewer probes, \\"Who decided to publish this amateurish attempt?\\" This rhetorical question highlights their dissatisfaction with the book and implies that it should not have even been published in the first place. 5. Potential for Improvement: Despite their overall criticism, the reviewer does mention that they hope the author will improve as their work progresses. While this statement may be seen as a silver-lining, it is quickly negated by their declaration that they will not continue to read the future books. This solidifies the negative tone and indicates that there is no interest in giving future works a chance. 6. Final Thoughts: The reviewer ends their review with a recommendation that life is too short to read bad books and suggests finding better alternatives. This wraps up their critique with a clear message: they do not feel that the book is worth anyone's time, especially not for children. In summary, based on these observations, the tone of the product review is undoubtedly negative, as the reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with several elements of the book and recommends seeking better alternatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \\"What I Did for Love\\" from A Chorus Line and \\"Tomorrow\\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"That's the Trouble\\". The album finished with \\"I Need a Man\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview.  In 1978, Jones and Moulton made Fame, an immediate follow-up to Portfolio, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" by Jacques Prevert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\", which replaced \\"All on a Summers Night\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\"Do or Die\\". In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the \\"Do or Die\\"/\\"Pride\\"/\\"Fame\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD. Jones' live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called \\"Queen of the Gay Discos.\\"  Muse was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\"I'll Find My Way to You\\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\"Again and Again\\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\"Suffer\\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: was it a single or an album?","output":"It was an album.

Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the correct answer to the question \\"what do male dogs use in their urine to mark their territory?\\" is not \\"layers of fat.\\" Instead, as you have mentioned, male dogs use natural aphrodisiacs in their urine to mark their territory. These natural aphrodisiacs are, in fact, chemicals called pheromones. Pheromones are volatile, organic compounds secreted by animals, which are responsible for conveying information such as reproductive status, marking territory, and signaling alarm, among other functions. In the case of male dogs, they use pheromones to signal their presence and dominance to other dogs in the area. These pheromones are specifically found in a dog's urine and act as a chemical marker that they deposit onto the environment in order to communicate and assert their territory. Beyond territorial marking, pheromones also play a significant role in the social and reproductive lives of dogs. For example, female dogs emit certain pheromones during their reproductive cycles, which male dogs can sense and respond to accordingly. Similarly, male dogs can detect the pheromones released by other males or females in their environment to help them assess any potential threats or opportunities for mating. While layers of fat do not play a role in a male dog's ability to mark their territory with urine, fat has other essential functions for a dog's overall health and well-being. As an important component of their diet, fat provides energy, supports cell function, maintains the skin and coat, and aids in the absorption of essential vitamins. It is crucial to ensure that dogs have a well-balanced diet with appropriate levels of fat, as both excessive and insufficient fat intake can lead to health issues. In conclusion, male dogs use natural aphrodisiacs, specifically pheromones, in their urine to mark their territory instead of layers of fat. These pheromones are an essential means of communication for dogs, conveying information about territory, reproductive status, and social dynamics. Ensuring a well-balanced diet with appropriate levels of fat is still important for a dog's overall health and well-being, but it does not impact their ability to mark their territory using pheromones in their urine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A station wagon drives into town. Young Charlie Brown (Gary Crutcher) tells the townsfolk that the sheriff will be bringing the body into town. There have been other incidents involving livestock. His sister, Ann Brown (Jolene Brand) nods in agreement. The incidents seem to be localized to Devil's Crag. Sheriff Parker (Bob Steele) pulls up in a pickup truck. Parker explains that \\"The coroner's report shows Banks died of a brutal beating at the hands of a person or persons unknown.\\" The Café Owner (Oliver Blake) pulls back the tarp covering the body.

The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people.

Question: Question: \\"What is the English translation of Madhavacharya's work?\\"  Context: \\"Later Indian materialist Jayaraashi Bhatta (6th century) in his work Tattvopaplavasimha (\\"The upsetting of all principles\\") refuted the Nyaya Sutra epistemology. The materialistic Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1400. When Madhavacharya compiled Sarva-darśana-samgraha (a digest of all philosophies) in the 14th century, he had no Cārvāka/Lokāyata text to quote from, or even refer to.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The English translation of Madhavacharya's work, Sarva-darśana-samgraha, is \\"A Compendium of All Philosophies\\" or \\"A Digest of All Worldviews.\\" The work serves as a systematic overview and critique of the different philosophical schools in India during Madhavacharya's time. As an influential philosopher and celebrated Vedanta scholar of the 14th century, Madhavacharya aimed to provide an understanding of the various Indian philosophical systems in a single text. In Sarva-darśana-samgraha, Madhavacharya presents sixteen major Indian philosophical systems, including both orthodox and heterodox schools. The work examines views from prominent belief systems, such as: 1. Charvaka or Lokayata (Materialism) 2. Buddhism 3. Jainism 4. Nyaya (Indian logic) 5. Vaisheshika (Indian atomism) 6. Sankhya (Dualism) 7. Yoga (a sister system of Sankhya) 8. Mimamsa (ritual and hermeneutics) 9. Vedanta (end of the Vedas, specifically the Upanishads/Indian metaphysics) In the context provided, the materialistic Cārvāka philosophy seemed to have faded from prominence after the 14th century. Madhavacharya's compilation of Sarva-darśana-samgraha highlights that he could not find any original Carvaka or Lokayata texts to quote or reference while creating his digest of all philosophies. This fact underscores the decline of the materialistic Carvaka school in India. Despite the notable absence of original Carvaka texts, Madhavacharya's work is an invaluable resource for understanding the broad spectrum of Indian philosophical thought. The Sarva-darśana-samgraha not only offers a comprehensive overview of numerous philosophies but also compares and evaluates their fundamental principles and ideological assumptions. As a result, the text is an essential contribution to India's rich philosophical heritage and serves as a vital source of knowledge for scholars of Indian philosophy around the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: Right after the Pentagon was hit, NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft. It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all. After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland. But another aircraft was heading toward Washington, an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing: United 93. United Airlines Flight 93 FAA Awareness.

Joe Lieberman is one of President Donald Trump's top picks to be nominated as FBI director, Trump said Thursday.      Speaking to reporters while meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said he is \\"very close\\" to choosing a new FBI director to replace James Comey. And asked if Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent senator from Connecticut was a top candidate, Trump said yes.      Trump met with Lieberman Wednesday and found him \\"agreeable,\\" a source said.      Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have been interviewing candidates to lead the bureau since Trump suddenly fired former Comey last week only a few years into what was created to be up to a 10-year term.      The circumstances surrounding the firing have made the appointment closely watched, with senators calling for an unimpeachable, nonpartisan appointment.      The firing drew instant criticism from both sides of the aisle, as Comey was overseeing the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election and any possible links between the Trump camp and Russia during the campaign.      While Trump's team initially claimed that the firing came after a review by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, laid out in a memo, that largely faulted Comey on his handling of the investigation into the private email server of Hillary Clinton, Trump later said in an interview he had already decided to fire Comey and cited the Russia investigation as being at the top of mind.      After the firing, Rosenstein announced he would appoint a special counsel to oversee the investigation -- his decision because Sessions recused himself from it. Rosenstein only informed the White House of his decision to bring on former FBI Director Robert Mueller after the order was signed and less than an hour before it was announced publicly.      The naming of the special counsel has appeased some Democrats, who were threatening to try to block any FBI director until such a move was made. But the appointment does not assuage all concerns, and an FBI director would still play a major role as things moved forward.      Already one red-state Democrat, who would be a top target for Republicans to support a candidate, stated she would not be pleased with Lieberman as a pick.      \\"It's a mistake to nominate anyone who's ever run for office,\\" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters. \\"I'm somebody who spent a lot of time in law enforcement; this is a moment where we need a law enforcement professional that's never campaigned for a presidential candidate, never campaigned for office, never worn a party label to head the FBI.\\"      Lieberman's long history in politics      Lieberman was Democrat Al Gore's vice presidential nominee in 2000 and unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.      But Lieberman, 75, is not necessarily popular with Democrats. He lost to a Senate primary challenger in 2006 and only retained his seat after he switched his party to independent. He also backed Republican Sen. John McCain's presidential bid in 2008 over Barack Obama, speaking at the Republican National Convention that year.      Since leaving the Senate, Lieberman has been a senior counsel at the New York law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP and serves on a number of boards.      Potentially complicating his issues with Democrats, Lieberman's firm has represented Trump in past litigation.      Other candidates considered included current acting Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Gov. and FBI Agent Frank Keating, career FBI official Richard McFeely and Texas Sen. John Cornyn and New York Judge Michael Garcia, who both withdrew their names.      When Cornyn was under consideration, even his GOP colleagues questioned whether he would be the right choice as an elected official.      Lieberman's closest law enforcement experience is serving as his state's attorney general, an elected position. FBI directors traditionally have had prosecutorial experience, either as an FBI agent or as a member of the Justice Department.      Lieberman was born in Stamford, Connecticut, educated at Yale and Yale Law school, and served in the Connecticut state senate and as attorney general of the state before being elected as the state's Senator in Washington.      First elected in 1988, Lieberman served as a Democrat until 2006, when he became an independent who caucused with the Democrats. He did not seek re-election in 2012.      Lieberman is perhaps most famous for joining the ticket with Gore in his unsuccessful run for president in the 2000 election. Lieberman's selection as a vice presidential candidate was the first time a Jewish person was on a major party's presidential ticket.      The former senator was known to buck his party even before endorsing McCain. Lieberman was the first Democratic senator to criticize former President Bill Clinton publicly during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.      Lieberman is a devout follower of Orthodox Judaism.

Asked if Mr. Lieberman was one of his top picks, Mr. Trump said, “He is.”      Selecting... ||||| President Donald Trump may be dramatically miscalculating how much support Sen. Joe Lieberman would have among his former Democratic colleagues if nominated to become FBI director.      Some Senate Democrats hold a grudge against Lieberman for his rightward turn and opposition to some of President Barack Obama's agenda late in his Senate career. Others say even though they respect Lieberman, the job of FBI director should not go to a former politician. And all Democratic senators interviewed for this story said the former Connecticut senator lacks the kind of experience needed for the post.      Story Continued Below      The 2000 Democratic vice presidential candidate, who later caucused with the party as an independent in the Senate after losing his 2006 Senate primary, has emerged as a front-runner to replace fired FBI Director James Comey. But Lieberman's nomination likely would produce the most partisan vote for an FBI chief in Senate history. Typically, nominees for the job have been approved unanimously or with token opposition.      “I don’t think there's going to be much excitement about that from our side of the aisle. Not because we don’t respect Joe Lieberman. But we need a law enforcement professional, not someone who’s run for office before,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). “We don’t need anyone who’s put on a red shirt or blue shirt — or who’s campaigned for president.” Lieberman ran for president in 2004.      Republicans are lining up behind Lieberman, who left the Senate in 2013 after four terms. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called him a \\"person of unquestioned integrity and that's what we need.\\" Added Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has spoken to Lieberman about the job: \\"If the president picked Joe Lieberman he’d be doing [the] country a good service and, I think, the FBI a good service.\\"      But Republicans seem to be overstating Lieberman's Democratic support. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) predicted Lieberman would get 100 votes, a near impossibility.      But Lieberman’s relationship with Democrats is damaged. After he left office, he urged senators in his own party to reject Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, infuriating Democrats. And his relationship with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Graham — the trio were known as the “three amigos” — tilted the Senate in a more hawkish direction during the first four years of Obama’s presidency. In 2008, Lieberman endorsed McCain over Obama for president.      “He has a history of angering Democrats and Republicans, which is probably a good experience for being FBI director. But my concern is about someone with a political background. This is a moment for someone with a law enforcement background,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who holds Lieberman’s old seat. “It’s really important to restore people’s faith in the FBI.”      Perhaps most surprising, Lieberman lacks support across the Democratic ideological spectrum. Moderates like McCaskill and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who are up for reelection in 2018 and could face difficult votes if Lieberman is indeed the nominee, are not lobbying for the former centrist Democratic senator.      “Any other time, man, Joe is an excellent, excellent, choice,” Manchin said.      Still, many liberals flat out don't like Lieberman. In an interview, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) fumed about Lieberman’s efforts to undercut more generous Medicare benefits in Obamacare and his relative closeness to Trump. After a monologue on Lieberman's faults, Brown ended by telling a reporter: “That’s all on the record.”      “Joe Lieberman has no real law enforcement credentials. Look where he works now, a Trump law firm. That tells me a lot,” Brown said, referring to the law firm where Lieberman now works that represents Trump.

Lieberman also opposed a Democratic proposal to extend Medicare to people 55 and older, infuriating liberals. “He’s the reason we lost Medicare at 55 … Couldn’t have had anything to do with the insurance industry lobbying in Hartford. I’m sure Lieberman couldn’t succumb to that,” Brown said sarcastically.      Trump said on Thursday that he’s “very close” on selecting a nominee. Republicans have the votes to confirm him if they stay united. But Lieberman is unlikely to garner a large bipartisan majority, which could fuel accusations that Republicans are politicizing the FBI.      “We ought to stay away from political figures,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “All the voting history, all the party history, whatever it is, I would stay away from it. Stick with the professionals.”      Elana Schor contributed to this report. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Former Sen.

We fans of Ed Wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place, but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that I have never before approached! One of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as I am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure. I remember how, as a teenager, I longed to see Eddie's \\"Revenge of the Dead\\" (a.k.a. \\"Night of the Ghouls\\"), which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades. Likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as Doris Wishman's \\"A Night to Dismember\\" or half the works of Jesus Franco! However, recent years have seen video and DVD rendering these once unfindable treasures almost TOO accessible - even for those of us on the 'wrong' (!) side of the Atlantic.... And then, behold, there was \\"I Woke Up Early the Day I Died\\" - a movie that SHOULD have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before Fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite. The 1990s NEEDED a hard-to-find movie though which would REALLY be worth hunting out: and this, to be sure is it.... I don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy-yet-kitsch cast, its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals, its wondrous moments of \\"pure cinema\\" (in the sense of the 1920s French cineastes) and surrealism, or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here. What I DO wish to mention, briefly, is the pleasure that I have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us-but-thankfully-not-quite movie! I think the German video, which I picked up while in Cologne on a cold crisp winter's day, is fairly well-known to Ed Wood's followers now. It is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released. However, there is thankfully more to be found!!! Firstly, there are a number of reviews available from the film's German THEATRICAL release - I have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to \\"Woodify\\" my students..... some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the American trash AND European arthouse traditions. Secondly, there is the score by Larry Groupe', which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener, particularly if you are contemplating the film's currently \\"vaulted\\" status and growing a little melancholy at the same time. Finally - for now - I wish to mention the promo SOUNDTRACK that Cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers. BEG, BORROW, STEAL, KILL or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these!!!!!! It features 14 tracks from the film, including Eartha Kitt's ballad, the late Darcy Clay's \\"Jesus I Was Evil\\" (two versions of which are also available on CD from New Zealand, although that is another story again!), the cool radio music to which Christina Ricci dances, and also those amazing techno drops by Minty and ZHV (the latter being Billy Z's very own techno band).....

Victoria, on the other hand, would take every opportunity to stroll among the vibrant and fragrant hibiscus blooms. The beautiful flowers encircled the entire landscape, making it a stunning sight to behold. Victoria found the sweet aroma of the hibiscus both soothing and calming, basking in the tranquility it brought to her. As the brilliant shades of pinks, reds, and yellows entwined with the deep greens of their leaves, Victoria was drawn even more strongly to their beauty. When the sun would seep through the canopy of trees and shine a golden light on the colorful blooms, Victoria felt that the garden seemed as a gateway to a secret, enchanted paradise, and she could get lost in her thoughts for hours while she strolled amidst this rich, lush oasis. Conversely, the intense hibiscus fragrance would send Monica on a different path in order to evade the flowers. Despite the garden's aesthetic allure, Monica simply could not accept the smell of hibiscus. It would often trigger her allergies, causing her eyes to water, and nose to run. Instead, she preferred to walk along the nearby cobblestone roads or the meandering paths that lay beyond the hibiscus borders. The sisters had been at odds about the garden ever since their younger days, when their grandmother first introduced them to the hibiscus flowers. While one sister found solace and comfort among these natural treasures, the other saw them as an obstacle to peace and wellness. Over the years, this disagreement had only served to strengthen each sister's connection with the garden, albeit in very different ways. Nonetheless, they respected each other's preferences and never forced the other to adapt. When it came to family gatherings or leisurely strolls, they managed to find common ground in other ways. The sisters would often spend quality time in the park or take long walks along the beach, where the scents of the sea would envelop them, and their hearts would fill with shared joy. Victoria loved nothing more than capturing the hibiscus flowers through her art. With delicate strokes of the brush, she carefully painted the blossoms, immortalizing their grandeur in her work. The walls of her home were adorned with these lovingly crafted masterpieces. When Monica visited her sister, she couldn't help but admire the artwork, recognizing the talent and passion Victoria had put into these creations. Ultimately, the smell of hibiscus became a symbol of the sisters' individuality, each representing the unique interests, preferences, and bonds they held with the world around them. The garden remained a place where Victoria could connect with the essence of nature, while Monica found her solace in exploring the serene spaces beyond its flowering borders. Their differences, like the contrasting scent of the flowers, only served to enhance the beauty and richness of their sisterly bond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce...

Втората съдебна инстанция отмени определение на Окръжен съд от 15 март тази година, с което това искане е било оставено без уважение, съобщиха от апелативния съд. От края на ноември 2016 година Тонев е бил привлечен като обвиняем по досъдебно производство на ОД МВР Шумен за присвояване в особено големи размери. Разследването е установило, че по девет от изпълнителните дела той е присвоил от специалната сметка сумата от 256 907 лева, които ползвал за лични нужди. Според закона това е тежко умишлено престъпление, представляващо особено тежък случай, извършено в продължителен период от време и от длъжностно лице. Тонев е с мярка за неотклонение парична гаранция в размер с 5000 лева, определена от ОС-Шумен. Частният съдебен изпълнителвече е изтърпял наказание „отстраняване от длъжност за 1 година“, наложено му от Дисциплинарната комисия на Камарата на частните съдебни изпълнители. За този период от време архивът на Тонев е бил предаден на друг ЧСИ. Срокът на наказанието му е изтекъл на 12 януари 2017, а месец по-късно със заповед на министъра на правосъдието Асен Тонев е бил възстановен на длъжност ЧСИ. Предстоящо е и връщането на архива му. Междувременно в протеста на прокуратурата се сочи, че за друго допуснато от него нарушение Камарата на ЧСИ е насрочила за разглеждане ново дело. За да отстрани Тонев от длъжност ЧСИ, днес Апелативният съд във Варна е преценил, че той е обвинен за тежко умишлено престъпление, свързано със службата му. „Ако Асен Тонев приеме отново във владение архива на изпълнителните си дела, то този факт може да създаде реална опасност за обективното, всестранно и пълно изясняване на обстоятелствата по делото“, са се мотивирали още съдиите.

Federal investigators swarmed a ranch east of Mexico City on Thursday, where they confirmed that at least seven bodies had been found, and that two arrests were made near the location. A lawyer representing the families of five of the missing, however, told CNNMexico that he received a call from a source who said the bodies of the youths may be found there. The lawyer did not reveal his source. The apparent kidnapping of the 12 youths from an after-hours club called Heavens shocked residents of Mexico City, who for the most part have been spared from the violence seen in other areas. The lawyer, Ricardo Martinez, said his source told him there were 13 bodies found at the ranch, possibly in two mass graves, one that held the remains of the males, and the other, the females. Mexico City's attorney general on Thursday said there was one grave so far that was being investigated. Officials have not confirmed the identities of the bodies, and CNN could not independently confirm the claims of the attorney. Martinez said that a suspect in the disappearance of the youths led authorities to the ranch. Families of missing haunted by mystery. Mexico City Attorney General Rodolfo Rios said investigators were taking DNA samples to identify the remains, which could take several days. The site where the bodies are found is the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Local, state and federal police were all at the scene. A gang was involved in the mass disappearance, officials have said. The May 26 incident at the after-hours bar jolted the capital city, given it took place in daylight on a Sunday morning. Video footage shows a gang of about 17 people arriving in eight vehicles at the fashionable Zona Rosa district, according to authorities.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Now, I have a new situation: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step of the process in muscle contraction is the generation of a neural signal, also known as a motor impulse, by the brain. This motor impulse is sent from the brain through the spinal cord and nerves to the specific muscle fibers that need to contract. In this step, the brain is essentially instructing the muscles to initiate contraction by communicating with motor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells responsible for controlling muscle movement. This neural signal is the initial trigger for the complex sequence of events that result in muscle contraction and the interaction of the filaments within the muscle fibers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves Answer:","output":"The final step of the process you described is photosynthesis. After carbon dioxide enters the leaf through stomata and water is absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves through vessels in the stem, the plant uses these materials along with sunlight to perform photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, the plant's chlorophyll-containing cells (chloroplasts) capture sunlight energy and convert it into chemical energy. This energy is used to combine carbon dioxide from the air and water from the roots to produce glucose (a sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant for growth, reproduction, and energy storage, while oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This process is essential for life on Earth, as it provides oxygen for other organisms and helps regulate carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - broad - loose - slack - windtight - crap  The rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer to the question, \\"Sarah told him to make sure that the bundle was tight. Some fell out because it was what?\\" is based on the understanding of the context, the meaning of the words provided as choices, and the logical relationship between the words and the situation described. A: Context Understanding In this situation, Sarah instructed someone to make sure the bundle was tight. This implies that Sarah wanted the bundle to be secure, with its contents held firmly together. The fact that some items fell out indicates the bundle was not adequately tied, hinting at a possible lack of tightness or looseness. B: Meaning and Relevance of Each Choice 1. Broad - This word describes something wide or extensive in extent or scope. It is not related to the tightness of the bundle and thus not the cause of the items falling out. 2. Loose - This word is the opposite of tight, referring to something that is not securely fastened or held together. This directly relates to the issue of the bundle that Sarah wanted to avoid. 3. Slack - This word can have a similar meaning to loose. However, slack implies a lack of tautness or tension rather than a lack of secure fastening. Slack is less appropriate in this context, but it still has some relevance. 4. Windtight - This term refers to something being impervious to air or drafts. It does not relate to the tightness of a bundle or items falling out. 5. Crap - This word is informal slang used to describe something of poor quality, rubbish or nonsense. It does not directly pertain to the tightness of the bundle or the falling out of its contents. C: Logical Relationship Between Choices and the Situation After analyzing the context and the meanings of the given choices, \\"loose\\" emerges as the most logical answer in this situation. The other options do not directly address the tightness of the bundle or the falling out of its contents. Since Sarah explicitly instructed someone to make sure the bundle was tight, the issue of items falling out is most likely due to the bundle being loose. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"loose\\" as the answer to this question is based on the understanding of the context, meaning of each word provided as a choice, and the logical relationship between the choices and the situation described. The word \\"loose\\" is the most appropriate choice because it directly relates to the lack of tightness that led to the items falling out of the bundle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer this question: what is the wildcard mask equivalent of the subnet mask /23??","output":"Alright, little buddy, let me explain this to you like a story. Imagine, there are houses in your village, and the village has certain rules. In the world of computers, the houses are called \\"IP addresses\\" and the rules are called \\"subnet masks.\\" Now, the /23 you see there is a subnet mask, like a rule. It tells us how many houses (IP addresses) can be in a group. The number 23 means that there are 23 streets, and each house on the street gets a number. A wildcard mask is like the opposite of a subnet mask. It helps us find out what houses don't have this /23 rule. It's like knowing which houses don't have the same color. So, to find the wildcard mask, we need to do some simple counting. Remember, there are 32 streets total, but we only have 23 with the /23 rule. So, we're missing 32 - 23 = 9 streets. Now, we can figure out how many houses don't have the rule by using the magic number 2. The magic works this way: we multiply 2 by itself 9 times, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 512. But we need to be careful! We should subtract one from 512 to get the final answer. So, 512 - 1 = 511. The wildcard mask equivalent of the subnet mask /23 is 0.0.1.255.

Review: Robert Altman shouldn't make a movie like this, but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of Grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable. In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn't always very successful at, or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director: plot. There's one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. And it's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these \\"I saw that coming from back there!\\" endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller. But it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment. The film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for Altman), as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. So the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with, and Robert Downey Jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in Branaugh's employ. Did I neglect Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on?  As said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow. If it's not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-Southern-noir. Now, what is this review like? Possible answers: [i] negative. [ii] positive.","output":"This review can be considered as [ii] positive. The reviewer appreciates the versatility of Robert Altman in creating a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Northern Isles  is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century.  - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land.  - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire.  - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top...  - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland.

Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.  - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands.  - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn.  - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes.    What is the relationship between 'fearnan' and 'perth and kinross'?

Title: Dissapointed Review: I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn't read much of it before I gave up - only the first 30 pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \\"cinammon rolls\\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking. The other characters felt like filler, and the world as a whole was difficult to visualize. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, the product review is negative.

The two questions, \\"How do girls feel when they are squirting?\\" and \\"How does it feel for a woman to squirt?\\" are indeed the same. They aim to understand the sensations and emotions experienced by a female during the act of squirting. Both questions inquire about the feelings, and while the phrasing is slightly different, they essentially explore the same topic. Squirting, also known as female ejaculation, is a phenomenon involving the release of fluid from a woman's urethra at the time of sexual arousal or orgasm. While it is a subject of debate among researchers and scientists, many women have reported experiencing squirting, and various explanations attribute it to the Skene's glands, the G-spot, or the bladder. The sensations and emotions a woman might feel during squirting can vary greatly from individual to individual. Some women might experience a heightened sense of pleasure and arousal, whereas others could feel discomfort or even embarrassment. Physically, a woman may feel a rapid, intense release of pressure, accompanied by muscle contractions in the pelvic area. This feeling is often followed by a sense of relaxation or satisfaction. Emotionally, the experience could be thrilling, liberating, empowering, or simply a new sensation for the individual. It is important to note that women's experiences with squirting will differ due to various factors such as personal preferences, comfort levels, past sexual experiences, and physiological factors, among others. Communication and understanding between partners play a significant role in supporting a woman's experience of squirting.  In conclusion, both questions essentially ask the same thing and aim to understand the experience of women during the act of squirting. Due to the complexities of the female body and individual differences, the sensations and emotions felt by a woman during the act can differ, making it essential to foster healthy communication and exploration in the realm of sexual experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the following context:  Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with Arista Records in 1976. With the encouragement of Arista's management they stripped back down to a five-man core group and were reborn as an arena rock band. John Dalton left the band before finishing the sessions for the debut Arista album. Andy Pyle was brought in to complete the sessions and to play on the subsequent tour. Sleepwalker, released in 1977, marked a return to success for the group as it peaked at number 21 on the Billboard chart. After its release and the recording of the follow-up, Misfits, Andy Pyle and keyboardist John Gosling left the group to work together on a separate project. Dalton returned to complete the tour and ex–Pretty Things keyboardist Gordon John Edwards joined the band. In May 1978, Misfits, the Kinks' second Arista album, was released. It included the US Top 40 hit \\"A Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy\\", which helped make the record another success for the band. The non-album single \\"Father Christmas\\" has remained a popular track. Driven by session drummer Henry Spinetti's drumming and Dave Davies' heavy guitar the song \\"Father Christmas\\" has become a classic seasonal favorite on mainstream radio. Dalton left the band permanently at the end of their UK tour, and Gordon John Edwards followed. Ex-Argent bassist Jim Rodford joined the band before the recording of Low Budget, on which Ray Davies played the keyboard sections. Keyboardist Ian Gibbons was recruited for the subsequent tour, and became a permanent member of the group.

Which process will separate the sugar from a mixture of sugar and water? Pick the answer from these options","output":"Although you didn't provide any specific options to choose from, I can provide you with a detailed explanation of a process that can separate sugar from a mixture of sugar and water. The most common and effective process to achieve this is evaporation. Evaporation is a process in which a liquid is transformed into a gas or vapor, leaving behind any dissolved solids or solutes that were part of the liquid state. When it comes to a sugar and water mixture, evaporation can be used to separate the sugar (a solute) from the water (a solvent). Here's a step-by-step guide to separate sugar from a sugar-water mixture using evaporation: 1. Find a heat source: In order to speed up the process of evaporation, a heat source is required. This can be a stove, an oven, or even direct sunlight. However, be cautious not to use excessive heat as it may cause caramelization of the sugar. 2. Choose an appropriate container: Select a heat-resistant, shallow container with a large surface area to expose more of the sugar-water mixture to the heat. This will help speed up the evaporation process. A glass or ceramic container is suitable for this purpose. 3. Pour the sugar-water mixture into the container: Gently pour the sugar-water mixture into the container, ensuring that it's evenly distributed. Maintaining a thin layer of the mixture will assist in speeding up the evaporation process. 4. Place the container on your heat source: Place the container on the heat source and monitor the temperature closely. Remember, too much heat can damage the sugar. Maintain a temperature of around 60 - 90 degrees Celsius (140 - 194 degrees Fahrenheit). 5. Observe the evaporation process: As the water evaporates, the sugar will be left behind. You will notice that the water level decreases and a layer of sugar starts to form on the surface. 6. Collect the sugar: Once all the water has evaporated, and you're left with only sugar, carefully collect it from the container using a spatula or similar tool. Leave the sugar to cool down before transferring it to a storage container or using it for your intended purpose. Using the evaporation process, you can successfully separate sugar from the liquid portion of the sugar-water mixture. Keep in mind that this method might take time, depending on the heat source and the size of the container. By following these steps, you should be able to effectively separate sugar from a sugar-water mixture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \\"see\\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \\"partial report paradigm\\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \\"whole report\\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.

The woman, purported to be in the first trimester of her pregnancy, according to Live Action, says she does not know the gender of her fetus but wants to abort if it turns out to be female. \\"The abortion covers you up until 23 weeks,\\" says Rebecca, \\"and usually at five months is usually (sic) when they detect, you know, whether or not it's a boy or a girl.\\" The staffer recommends to the woman that she \\"just continue and try again\\" if her fetus turns out to be female. \\"Good luck, and I hope that you do get your boy,\\" Rebecca says. In a statement, Planned Parenthood's vice president of education, Leslie Kantor, said the staffer was in an entry-level job and is no longer working for the organization.

Syrian tripped by Hungarian camerawoman gets job offer at Spanish soccer coaching school The video footage sparked international outrage: A desperate Syrian father, clutching his small son, runs with hundreds fleeing from authorities at an Hungarian camp. Then, a Hungarian camerawoman sticks her leg out and trips him. He tumbles. He screams. Although he was just one of thousands fleeing war-torn Syria, the incident set off a wave of media coverage, and soon he wasn't a nameless refugee. He is Osama Abdul Mohsen, father to 7-year-old Zaid, and he once coached division one soccer in Syria. [At choke points on the way to Western Europe, chaos and growing frustration] Now, Spain's national soccer coach training center, Cenafe, has arranged for him to come to the country, where a job offer and a place to live near Getafe await him, the Associated Press reported. \\"Hopefully, this will serve as an example to the rest of Europe,” school director Miguel Galán said, according to AP. “We need to help these people.” A Hungarian camerawoman with the country's N1 TV station is seen tripping a man holding a child. The scene was captured at the Roeszke camp as refugees tried to escape from the police. The woman has since been fired. (Stephan Richter/Twitter) Mohsen arrived in Madrid on Thursday after traveling by train from Germany with two of his sons, an Arabic-speaking Cenafe student and a reporter from the Spanish newspaper El Mundo. \\"I am very, very happy when Mr. Miguel called [me] to come to Spain,\\" Mohsen said on the train in an video interview with El Mundo. \\"I see a future for my family in Spain.\\" [Five ways to solve Europe’s refugee crisis] Mohsen's wife and two other children remain in Turkey, and he said on camera that it's \\"very vital\\" that his family reunite with him in Spain. Authorities at the soccer academy are working to have Mohsen's family join him and to get him legalized so he can work there, AP reported. The migrant crisis in Europe reached a new apex this week when Hungary erected 109 miles of razor-wire fencing along its border, hoping to keep out people seeking to make it farther inland to wealthier nations such as Germany. Last month, a record 156,000 migrants entered Europe, according to the E.U. border agency Frontex. Spain pledged last week to welcome 17,680 refugees. After footage showing her tripping Mohsen went viral, Hungarian camerawoman Petra Laszlo was fired from N1TV, considered a right-wing station. She subsequently apologized. [‘Something snapped in me': Hungarian camerawoman apologizes for tripping refugees] Cenafe's director told El Pais that it used its advertising budget to pay for an apartment for Mohsen. \\"When we saw the story of Mohsen published in the newspapers we felt very bad about it,” Galán told the newspaper. “As soon as he learns Spanish, we plan to offer him a job at our organization.” In a statement, the soccer academy said that many of its students go on to work internationally and that the addition of Mohsen will help to better prepare them for foreign work. \\"We can only thank Osama for accepting our invitation,\\" the statement read.

Article: Nancy Tillman's wonderful On the Night You Were Born is one of my very favorite books. Its celebration of the uniqueness of each and every child told in lyrical language makes it the gift I choose most often for expectant or adoptive parents. I also read it regularly with my grandchildren and talk with them about how special they are. Tillman feels that the most important message for children to receive is simply, \\"You are loved.\\" And it's that message that is the focus of this, her newest book, Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You. Once again, it is her turn of phrase that most fascinates me: In the green of the grass ... in the smell of the sea ... in the clouds floating by ... at the top of a tree ... in the sound crickets make at the end of the day ... \\"You are loved. You are loved. You are loved,\\" they all say. Phrases encourage children to grow, to try new things, to \\"march to the front\\" of their \\"own parade\\" and assures them that, no matter how far they go or what they do, they will be loved. Though the words alone would convince me to buy, share and recommend this book, Tillman is also a gifted artist and her lovely work makes this book a visual treasure as well. Through the pages, a child rides hippos, splashes in the surf with elephants, plays hide and seek with rabbits, shares a trampoline  with a kangaroo and enjoys some quiet time with a pair of pandas. My favorite drawing has the child walking away along a wide path that runs between trees covered in mist. In all of the drawings, swirls of sparkling lights wrap around the child--the love that will always be with him/her. I've read On the Night You Were Born dozens of times and with every single reading, I am incredibly touched. Wherever You Are: My Love Will Find You creates the same feeling of wonder, peace and happiness in me.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: A collision between a comet and an asteroid named Orpheus takes place. Now the meteor Orpheus, which is five miles wide, is on a collision course with Earth. While the United States government and military engage in political maneuvering, other smaller and faster moving fragments rain down on Earth. The major plot point involves secret orbiting nuclear missile platforms, one put up by Dr. Bradley's (Connery) team for the U.S., named Hercules and another constructed by his counterpart in the Soviet Union, nicknamed Peter the Great by Dubov. The American president (Fonda) is advised by military leaders against admitting the existence of Hercules, at the same time the Soviets are reluctant to admit to the existence of its orbital weapons.The President goes on national television and reveals the existence of Hercules, explaining it as a foresighted project to meet the threat that Orpheus represents. He also offers the Soviets a chance to save face and join in by saying they had the same foresight and have their own. Bradley requested a scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov (Keith) to help him plan a countereffort against Orpheus.Bradley and Sherwood have already arrived at the control center for Hercules, which is located beneath the Sony Building (then called the AT&T; Building) in downtown New York. Major-General Adlon (Landau) is the commander of the facility. Dubov and his assistant (and English voice) Tatiana Donskaya (Natalie Wood) arrive and Bradley works at breaking the ice of distrust held by Hercules commander Adlon. Since Dubov cannot admit the existence of the Soviet device, he agrees to Bradley's proposal that they work on the \\"theoretical\\" application of how a \\"theoretical\\" Soviet platform's weapons would be coordinated with the American ones.Meanwhile, further fragments of the meteor affect the Earth.

Question: What character does the guard  think mistake for a Prince? Movie title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity. Tom is made a ward of the new king, Hertford is banished for life, and Hendon is rewarded for his services.","output":"In the movie \\"The Prince and the Pauper,\\" the Captain of the Guard mistakes the prince, Edward VI, for the pauper, Tom, when the boys exchange clothes as a prank."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: This article: Sir Henry Joseph Wood  (3 March 1869 – 19 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.  He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the \\"Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", although they continued to be generally referred to as \\"the Proms\\". Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel Garcia and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company.  He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin in 1892. From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen's Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music.  When the Queen's Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall. Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music.

'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, from north London, claims she did not know where the money came from when she agreed to carry €20,000 to Istanbul. A young British student accused of smuggling cash in her knickers to fund jihadists fighting in Syria today said she had been 'stitched up' by her friend. Nawal Msaad, 27, was caught with the stash of €20,000, the equivalent of £15,830, in rolled up notes as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul from Heathrow, jurors have heard. The Old Bailey was earlier told she agreed to be a 'trusted courier' for her close friend Amal El Wahabi, also 27. The money was to be taken to Turkey at the request of El Wahabi’s husband Aine Davis, who was known as Hamza and had joined fighters in war-torn Syria, the court heard. But she was stopped by police after the cash - which had been hidden inside her in a condom - fell out into her pants. Taking to the witness box at the Old Bailey in tight light pink trousers, a white sleeveless shirt and pink strappy high heel shoes, Msaad insisted she had never meant to smuggle cash abroad to bankroll terrorism. And she accused her friend and co-defendant El Wahabi of 'stitching' her up by not telling her where the money had come from. Her defence barrister Naeem Mian asked her: 'It was put to you that in effect you have been stitched up by her, what do you say to that?' Msaad said: 'Well, she wasn’t completely honest with me about where the money came from. And so I do get that feeling, I’m not going to deny that - the feeling that I have been stitched up.' Msaad, of Holloway, north London, and El Wahabi, of north west London, both deny funding terrorism. Msaad, who was born and raised in London and studying human resource management at London Metropolitan University in Aldgate, said she has known her friend since their school days at Holland Park School. She admitted having a 'soft spot' for her friend, but said they are not very close. And she vehemently denied ever trying to smuggle cash to extremists fighting in Syria, which is in the midst of a bloody civil war. Speaking so softly that the judge had to repeatedly ask her to keep her voice up, she flatly denied the charge against her. Mr Mian asked her: 'Between 13 and 16 of January 2014 were you concerned in an arrangement to make money available for the purposes of terrorism?' She replied: 'No'. He added: 'Did you suspect that the €20,000 given to you by El Wahabi may have been for the purposes of terrorism?' She again replied: 'No'. Her barrister said: 'Were you ever told or did you ever suspect that Aine Davis, otherwise known as Hamza, was or may be involved in terrorism.' She replied: 'No' and also said she had no idea the cash might have come from drug dealing and crime. She added: 'I had no intention to smuggle money into Turkey.' On January 16 this year Msaad set off for Heathrow airport for the three-day trip but when she approached the departure gate she was stopped by police. She said she was going for a 'short break', was buying gold for her mother and had €20,000 'around me'. She was later arrested. Davis allegedly left London in July last year to pursue the jihadist cause but had maintained regular contact with his wife, with whom he has two young sons. The 30-year-old, who was also born in London with roots in Gambia, converted to Islam six or seven years ago, it is alleged. Accusation: Msaad (left) claims she thought the €20,000 was for her school friend and co-defendant Amal El Wahabi (right) to start a new life abroad with her husband and children. Msaad was arrested at Heathrow. Msaad said El Wahabi originally said she had a job for her and that she would be paid €1,000 if she did it. She told jurors she was 'curious' and originally thought it might be a hairdressing job. El Wahabi texted her friend and said 'I asked you because I trust you' but later said she 'can’t explain' the job by phone, the court heard. But El Wahabi later told her it was to courier around €10,000 (£7,900) or 'maybe more' to her husband who she was going to travel abroad to live with, along with their two children. Msaad said she believed the cash was for a new house as the family were setting up home abroad. She later had a phone call with Davis on January 13 who asked her to bring €20,000 (£15,800) over. Msaad told the court: 'I asked \\"how much?\\" He said 20 bags - a bag is €1,000 in slang.' Asked if she had any concerns about travelling with such a large amount of cash on her, she said: 'It is a lot of money, it’s a big responsibility. 'I just didn’t want to lose their money. I was a bit worried.' But she insisted she didn’t think she was doing anything illegal. Denial: Msaad spoke at the Old Bailey to deny funding terrorism and said she has never held extremist views. She said: 'I asked him \\"Are you allowed to bring that amount of money over?\\" 'The way he sounded was really reassuring. He said \\"It’s fine, you can bring that amount of money\\", I had no reason to doubt him.' She admitted she had never asked where the cash came from, but thought it to be Davis’ savings. Msaad, whose family come from Morocco, said she is a Muslim who prays and fasts on Ramadan, but 'wouldn't say my family is particularly religious. I wouldn't call myself religious'. And she denied that she was very political or had ever viewed extremist, jihadi literature. She told the court: 'I would say I'm not more or less than the average person is interested in politics. 'However, I'm sensitive to the situations that are going on in the world, I don't turn a blind eye to anything.

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.  Paragraph: John was studying the species in African Savannah. He noticed that elands, which is a prey animal, are basically nocturnal. On the other hand, wild boars, another prey animal, are not nocturnal.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which species would be less active at night, elands or wild boars?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I just saw this film yesterday. My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere. I feel I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor/actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. As of me, since I paid already, I wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope something good would turn up, but I didn't hold my breath, and luckily so cause I would have been a victim of the film just the same. This is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad. Speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical US phobia. Richard Gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best. Totally unconvincing for the job. The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get. I gather the film won't come out in the USA and will go straight to DVD. That's were it should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even worth a B-series movie.

Answer the following question: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  Which person observed a strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula?  Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose double triumph in piano and voice resulted in being awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival?, using the article: In 1937 Ferrier entered the Carlisle Festival open piano competition and, as a result of a small bet with her husband, also signed up for the singing contest. She easily won the piano trophy; in the singing finals she sang Roger Quilter's To Daisies, a performance which earned her the festival's top vocal award. To mark her double triumph in piano and voice, Ferrier was awarded a special rose bowl as champion of the festival.After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier began to receive offers of singing engagements. Her first appearance as a professional vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, though for Ferrier the event was overshadowed by the death of her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.When Albert Wilson joined the army in 1940, Ferrier reverted to her maiden name, having until then sung as 'Kathleen Wilson'. In December 1940 she appeared for the first time professionally as 'Kathleen Ferrier' in a performance of Handel's Messiah, under Hutchinson's direction. In early 1941 she successfully auditioned as a singer with the Council for the Encouragement of the Arts (CEMA), which provided concerts and other entertainments to military camps,..., what would be the answer ?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If there is an abundance of food available for the caterpillars to consume, it can have several effects on the subsequent cocoon formation and hatching process, which can be classified as both direct and indirect impacts on the life cycle of a butterfly. Direct Impact: 1. Increased Growth Rate: With access to plenty of food, caterpillars will have a higher chance of growing faster and larger, as they can feed constantly without any limitations. This increased growth rate will allow them to reach the cocoon formation stage more quickly, increasing the overall number of cocoons over a given time period. 2. Improved Health and Survival Rates: Ample food sources will provide caterpillars with the essential nutrients they require to maintain good health and develop properly. This will directly impact their survival rates, ensuring that more caterpillars can successfully form cocoons and transform into pupae. Indirect Impact: 1. Enhanced Cocoon Formation: If caterpillars are properly nourished, their overall health will be improved, allowing them to create more robust and well-constructed cocoons. This, in turn, can have an indirect impact on the hatching process, as stronger and healthier pupae will be better equipped to emerge as butterflies. 2. Increased Butterfly Population: If more cocoons hatch due to increased food availability for caterpillars, the overall butterfly population will experience a boost. This can indirectly affect their reproductive success, with a more significant number of butterflies being able to mate and lay eggs, further perpetuating the cycle. 3. Changes in Ecosystem Dynamics: An increase in the butterfly population as a result of more cocoons hatching can have indirect effects on the local ecosystem, promoting changes in resource availability and predator-prey dynamics. This could lead to further impacts on the life cycle of the butterflies and other species within the ecosystem. In summary, the availability of ample food for caterpillars can influence the cocoon formation and hatching process through both direct and indirect impacts. Directly, it helps caterpillars grow faster and healthier, while indirectly, it can lead to more robust cocoons, increase the butterfly population, and impact the overall ecosystem dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Ten Foot Pole is an American punk rock band, formerly on Epitaph Records.  - Rev is the second album by Ten Foot Pole , and the last to feature Scott Radinsky .  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Epitaph Records is a Hollywood-based independent record label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. The label was originally \\"just a logo and a P.O. box\\" created in the 1980s for the purpose of selling Bad Religion records, but has evolved into a large independent record label. Gurewitz took the name from a King Crimson song of the same name. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most of the bands on Epitaph were punk and pop punk groups, while there are many post-hardcore and bands signed to the label as well. A large portion of the record label, known as Hellcat Records, is owned by Tim Armstrong, frontman of the punk rock band Rancid. Several sister-labels also exist, such as ANTI-, Burning Heart Records, Fat Possum Records, Hellcat Records and Heart & Skull Records that have signed other types of bands.  - Scott David Radinsky (born March 3, 1968) is a left-handed former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball, who had an 11-year career from  and .

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped?  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","output":"The name of the person that George Grove helped is Camille Saint-Saëns.

There's no \\" right place \\" to put it, since the object is unpredictability, as with a knuckleball. Possible answers: (A). Yes; (B). It's impossible to say; (C). No; Hypothesis: A spitball is compared to a knuckleball.","output":"The hypothesis mentioned is indeed correct, so the answer would be (A). Yes. According to the paragraph provided, a spitball is compared to a knuckleball. Both the spitball and knuckleball are termed unpredictable in the context of how they move, making them difficult for the batter to hit in a game of baseball. This unpredictability is achieved by altering the ball's uniform weight and resistance.  In both cases, the alteration is achieved by the pitcher, either through the application of saliva or vaseline (in the case of a spitball) or by holding and releasing the ball in a specific manner (in the case of a knuckleball). The saliva, vaseline, or the specific grip impact the ball’s aerodynamics, causing it to move in an unpredictable trajectory that is difficult for the batter to anticipate. Thus, the paragraph does indeed compare a spitball to a knuckleball in this way.  Thus, the essence of this comparison is the notion of unpredictability in the behavior of the ball, aimed to disorient the batter and increase the chances of the pitcher successfully striking the batter out. This makes it evident that manipulation of the ball, whether through foreign substances or unique grips, becomes a skillful tactic employed by the pitcher in baseball, making the game all the more strategic and unpredictable.  Nevertheless, it's also worth mentioning that while both balls are used to add uncertainty to the game, the way they are thrown and the behavior they exhibit is different. For instance, the knuckleball is often less fast but more unpredictable in its trajectory due to the minimal spin when thrown, while a spitball can be more slippery and fast due to the lubricating action of the saliva or vaseline. However, in both cases, the end goal is the same—making the ball difficult for the batter to hit by promoting unpredictability in its trajectory, as the provided paragraph discusses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the former rank of the candidate who isn't involved in the incident?  During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues. They go to Andrei's house where they find him already dead. After the chase, Dorganosov demands the rest of his payment from his contractor, who is revealed to be Anatoly Grishin.

Question 1: Why acceleration due to gravity is zero at center? Question 2: Is acceleration due to gravity an absolute constant? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Why acceleration due to gravity is zero at the center? Step 1: Understand the concept of gravitational force Gravitational force is the attractive force between two objects with mass. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the masses of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 2: Apply the concept to objects inside a massive spherical body When a small object is inside a massive spherical body (e.g., planet or star), the gravitational force acting on the object is the vector sum of the forces exerted by all parts of the massive body. Step 3: Compute the net force at the center At the center of the spherical body, the gravitational forces exerted by all parts of the body effectively cancel one another out, as they are equal in magnitude and acting in opposite directions (due to symmetry). Step 4: Relate gravitational force and acceleration due to gravity Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object (F) is equal to the mass of the object (m) multiplied by its acceleration (a), or F = ma. Acceleration due to gravity (g) is the acceleration experienced by an object due to the gravitational force acting upon it.  Step 5: Conclude Since the net gravitational force at the center of the spherical body is zero, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is also zero at the center. Question 2: Is acceleration due to gravity an absolute constant? Step 1: Recognize that acceleration due to gravity varies with location Acceleration due to gravity is not an absolute constant because it depends on the distance from the center of the massive body and its mass distribution. Step 2: Establish factors that cause variation in acceleration due to gravity Acceleration due to gravity varies due to several factors such as altitude, latitude, and the irregular shape of a massive body (e.g., Earth). Generally, the acceleration due to gravity increases as you move towards the poles and decreases as you move towards the equator. Step 3: Conclude Acceleration due to gravity is not an absolute constant, as it varies depending on location and other factors. Conclusion: Although both questions are related to the acceleration due to gravity, they are not asking the same thing. Question 1 asks why the acceleration due to gravity is zero at the center of a massive body, while Question 2 asks if acceleration due to gravity is an absolute constant. We have demonstrated that the two concepts are distinct."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Problem Child 2 is the 1991 comedy film sequel to the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\"; a continuation of the exploits of Junior, an adopted orphan boy who deliberately wreaks comedic havoc everywhere he goes.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions.  - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context?  Context: Rip Off<br>Sarah was at the market. And she wanted to buy cabbage juice. And she saw a 16 ounce bottle for 6. She knew it was just cabbage and water. So she decided to buy her own juicer instead. Hypothesis: The market was where she was.","output":"Based on the given context, we can draw several hypotheses to analyze and interpret the situation presented. Here, I will provide a detailed and long answer, breaking down the hypothesis you have mentioned, and also offer alternative hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: The market was where she was. This hypothesis is evidently accurate given the context. Sarah was described to be at the market, where she attempted to purchase cabbage juice. The market is the location of her shopping experience, and it is where she discovered the 16-ounce bottle of cabbage juice priced at 6. Alternative Hypothesis 2: Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced. The context suggests that Sarah thought the price of the cabbage juice was not reasonable, given that it is just a mixture of cabbage and water. Her decision to purchase her own juicer is an indication that she found it more cost-effective to make the juice herself instead of buying it at the given price. Alternative Hypothesis 3: Sarah values self-reliance and cost-efficiency in her purchasing decisions. Sarah's choice to buy a juicer rather than purchasing the cabbage juice implies that she values the idea of being self-reliant and cost-efficient. By investing in a juicer, she will have the ability to make her own cabbage juice at a lower cost per ounce, as well as explore other juicing options, ultimately saving money in the long run. Alternative Hypothesis 4: Sarah may be concerned about the quality or freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is possible that Sarah also prefers homemade juice for reasons other than cost. Knowing that the pre-packaged juice consists only of cabbage and water, she may desire more control over its quality or freshness. By using a juicer to make her own cabbage juice, Sarah can ensure that her juice is made from fresh, high-quality ingredients and has not been subjected to preservatives or additives. In conclusion, based on the context, we can validate your initial hypothesis that the market was where Sarah was. Additionally, we can derive alternative hypotheses, which include the possibility that Sarah believed the cabbage juice was overpriced, values self-reliance and cost-efficiency, and may have concerns about the quality and freshness of the pre-packaged cabbage juice. These hypotheses contribute to our understanding of the overall situation and the reasons behind Sarah's decision to buy a juicer instead of the pre-packaged juice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: It started as a corner shop herbalist in Nottingham in 1849, and grew to become one of the most recognisable names on the British high street. Now Boots the chemist is the latest home-grown brand to be sold off to an American firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. US giant Walgreens already owns a 45 per cent stake in the British chain, which it acquired for £4billion in 2012. It is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner. End of an era: Boots is the latest British brand to be sold off to a U.S. firm – in a deal worth nearly £6billion. Boots is the latest in a long line of well-known British brands to be sold off to foreign companies. US supermarket chain Walmart took over Asda in 1999, while Cadbury has been owned by American firm Kraft since 2010. Italian tycoon Stefano Pessina, the chairman of Boots, is set to make around £1.5billion from the deal. He and private equity firm KKR have owned the business since 2007. Walgreens and Boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example, Boots’ popular No7 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the US by Walgreens stores. It is now possible the British outlets will stock more American brands, and may introduce US-style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Walgreens bosses are planning a major cost-cutting exercise designed to save £594million by 2017, however it is unclear how this will affect the British firm’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores. Mr Pessina, 73, will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business, called Walgreens Boots Alliance. He has described the deal as more of a ‘merger’ than an American takeover, adding that several British executives from Boots have already been given high-profile jobs by Walgreens. He said: ‘I strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets. ‘Today’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and I am convinced that their skills, expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution.’ The sale will mean the US retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries, as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world. Walgreens’ American boss, Greg Wasson, will run the new company as president and chief executive. Like Boots, Walgreens began as a single pharmacy. It was opened in 1901 by Charles R Walgreen Snr, and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines. Much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era. Walgreens has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines, but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking. When the deal was in its early stages, some suggested that Walgreens planned to move its headquarters from the US to Britain in order to save on corporation tax. But the firm has said this is not the case, and it will remain based at its current site in Chicago. Boots’ head office will stay in Nottingham, where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker John Boot, a Methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor. When he died in 1860 aged 45, his wife Mary and son Jesse took over the chain. By 1890, it had grown to more than 200 stores. ... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines. By RUTH SUNDERLAND, Associate City Editor. Long queues to pick up a prescription at Boots could be a thing of the past after the chemist’s merger with Walgreens. The American giant, which has more than 8,000 outlets across the US, is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters. Thanks to the superior systems, waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines. End of this headache? Customers wait to be served in a boots branch at Heathrow Airport, London. Boots in the UK could also copy Walgreens’ pharmacy apps. One allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine’s barcode on a smartphone. They can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes. At flagship Walgreens shops, there is also a no-appointment-needed doctor service, which could be replicated here. The US pharmacies offer many more vaccinations, including those for travellers going to exotic locations. If Boots began offering these services, it would save British customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor’s surgery for a jab. In the longer term, Boots’ American deal could lead to cheaper drugs, thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a US wholesaler called AmerisourceBergen. After the Boots-Walgreens merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together, putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices. Combined, the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet. And the traffic is not all one way. While Boots is a mid-market staple of the British shopping scene, pharmacies in the US are an entirely different matter. ‘Drugstores’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods, lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer. When it comes to cosmetics, drugstores offer budget brands, usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise. Women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions. But Boots is set to bring a slice of the British high street to Walgreens, launching wider ranges of its well-known brands including No7 and Botanics in US stores, and recruiting in-house beauty advisers. It will sell well-loved products such as No7 lipsticks to US women, and remodel Walgreens stores along British lines. Finally, UK customers will be relieved to learn that the Advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger, and that the familiar ‘three for two’ offers on Boots products will continue as normal.","output":"Boots is a popular store that started in Nottingham in 1849 as a small herbalist shop. Over time, it became very famous in the UK. Now, it is being sold to a big American company called Walgreens for £6 billion. Walgreens already owns about half of Boots. By buying the rest, they will become the only owner. This happened before with other popular brands like Asda (sold to Walmart) and Cadbury (sold to Kraft). The man in charge of Boots, Stefano Pessina, will make £1.5 billion from this deal. Boots and Walgreens have worked together in the past, like selling Boots' anti-ageing creams in America through Walgreens. Now, we might see more American things in Boots stores in the UK, and maybe even some health screening stations to check things like blood sugar or cholesterol. Walgreens wants to save some money, so they plan to cut costs by £594 million by 2017. It is not clear how this will affect the people who work at Boots and their 2,500 stores. Walgreens started just like Boots, as a small pharmacy in 1901. Today, after buying Boots, they will own over 11,000 shops in 12 countries and have the biggest network for distributing medicine. Boots might get some good things from this deal too. Walgreens has better technology for serving customers at the pharmacy counter, which means shorter waiting times. They also have some cool apps for getting prescriptions and doctor services without appointments. These could be introduced to Boots."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mike Waring, a private detective in Los Angeles whose nickname is \\"The Falcon,\\" is on a case. He follows a man named Andrews to a hotel, then reports back to his clients, club owners Kirk and Gregory, where the man, their business partner, can be found. They pay Waring a 500 fee, whereupon Wilma Rogers, who works at the club and likes Andrews, expresses her displeasure with Waring for informing on him. She also tips off Andrews that his partners are coming. Kirk and Gregory return, angry not only that they can't find Andrews or the 100,000 he embezzled, but that a hotel clerk, Perry, was under the impression that Waring left Andrews' room carrying what appeared to be a lot of money. Waring believes the club owners are trying to frame him. Elaine Carson offers to help, but before long Waring becomes suspicious of her behavior, too. Waring eventually is able to locate the missing money, which he gives to a police lieutenant, Cooper, for safekeeping. Then he exposes the real culprit behind Andrews' murder and the theft, Perry, the clerk.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak, that ends in Los Angeles, California? A:","output":"The passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak and has its final destination in Los Angeles, California, is the Sunset Limited. To provide a better understanding of the train's historical background, service details, and the merger with the Texas Eagle, I will expand on the topic below. The Sunset Limited traces its roots back to 1894 when the Southern Pacific Railroad began operating the service as one of the oldest named trains in the United States. The train initially ran between New Orleans, Louisiana, and San Francisco, California. Over time, the service underwent numerous changes, including rerouting, discontinuation, and changes in operating companies. Amtrak took over the operation of the Sunset Limited in 1971 after its formation. The train maintained its original route between New Orleans and San Francisco until 1996. However, due to a reorganization of Amtrak's long-distance services, the Sunset Limited's western terminus was altered to Los Angeles, California. The Texas Eagle, established in 1974, initially traveled between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Antonio, Texas. The route was extended to Los Angeles in 1981, before being split into two different services in the late 1980s. The Texas Eagle was revived as a daily service between San Antonio and Chicago, Illinois, in 1990, running over 1,306 miles. The integration of the Sunset Limited with the Texas Eagle was implemented to provide passengers an easier transition between the two long-distance train services. The Texas Eagle now runs daily from Chicago to San Antonio. On select days, the Texas Eagle's train cars continue further west with the Sunset Limited service after they separate in San Antonio. Passengers traveling to destinations between San Antonio and Los Angeles can continue on the same train without the need to transfer. This combined service effectively links three major destinations: Chicago, San Antonio, and Los Angeles. Both the Texas Eagle and the Sunset Limited provide passengers with various accommodation options, including sleeper and coach services, as well as a dining car for meals during their journey. Some amenities provided by Amtrak include large observation windows, Wi-Fi access, and comfortable seating arrangements. In summary, the Sunset Limited is the passenger train that is now part of the Texas Eagle, a 1,306-mile train route operated by Amtrak. By integrating these two services, Amtrak offers a convenient travel experience as passengers can journey seamlessly across the United States from Chicago to Los Angeles, passing through several major cities and significant geographical landmarks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The index fell below the mark at points during the day but closed in milestone territory at 22,016, per the AP. (The S&P 500 ticked up incrementally to 2,477 and the Nasdaq ticked down a smidge to 6,362.) The Dow's record has prompted a flood of commentary and factoids. Examples: Biggest gainer: Since March 1, shares of Boeing had contributed 380 points to the Dow as of Wednesday morning, more than any other company and ahead of McDonald's (171), UnitedHealth (166), Caterpillar (99), and 3M (91), per CNBC. The biggest detractor? IBM had the largest loss over the same span, 251 points. Dollar's role: As the Dow has risen, the US dollar has declined, losing about 10% of its value against major world currencies. The New York Times explores how the two are related, as does USA Today, which notes that a weak dollar helps big companies that do business abroad because their products are more affordable in foreign currencies. Trump's start: The Dow's close above 22,000 means that it has risen 20% in the 183 trading days since Election Day, per the Wall Street Journal. For a new president, that's second only to George HW Bush (171 days) and ahead of Barack Obama (537), George W. Bush (1,626), and Bill Clinton (308). Hold the applause: At MarketWatch, Rex Nutting argues that the cheerleading over the Dow's rise is overblown, given that most Americans don't own very many shares. The rise helps the richest Americans, while the young in particular are out of luck. \\"I bought my first shares for my retirement account back in the 1970s, so I've benefited from the incredible gains since then,\\" he writes. \\"But my children are buying high, not low.\\" Warning signs: At MoneyWatch, Anthony Mirhaydari is worried about weak economic fundamentals in regard to personal income growth, manufacturing, US auto sales, consumer sentiment, and more. As for this current surge: \\"Enjoy it while it lasts.\\" Why the rise? President Trump has been touting the surging Dow for a while now, and a post at Barron's suggests he's due some of the credit. He and the GOP \\"have campaigned on business-friendly policies such as a lower corporate tax rate and softer regulations,\\" writes Nicholas Jasinski. \\"If successfully implemented, investors believe that corporate earnings will increase.\\" Also at play: low unemployment, low interest rates, and the aforementioned weak dollar.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which friend didn't suffer permanent brain damage?

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured.

While there's clear influence from these languages, Romanian also has features that are exclusively shared with languages spoken in the Balkans (an area encompassing countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, etc.) that are not Romance languages.  It's also worth noting that Romanian retains a significant amount of vocabulary from Latin, despite multiple invasions and migrations into Romania throughout history. In fact, approximately 75-85% of Romanian words are of Latin origin. To further illustrate the complexity of Romanian -- while its syntax and grammar are largely Latin-based, there are also traits from the Slavic languages, reflecting historical influences. In addition, Romanian has been subject to Greek, Turkish, and Hungarian linguistic influences due to geographical proximity or political relations, which show in the significant number of loanwords from these languages. This multicultural influence is what makes Romanian an interesting subject of study, especially for linguists.

Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine and Russia plan to approve a road map to improved trade relations on Tuesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said Sunday in a late-night interview on Ukraine's national broadcaster, Inter TV.  The announcement comes just hours after a European Union officer said the EU had halted work on a trade agreement with Ukraine, after Kiev failed to show \\"clear commitment\\" to signing the deal.  Stefan Fule, European commissioner for enlargement and European neighborhood policy, said earlier Sunday on Twitter that the words and deeds of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government on the proposed pact were \\"further & further apart. Their arguments have no grounds in reality.\\"  Fule said he had told Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov in Brussels, Belgium, last week that further discussion on the agreement was conditional on a clear commitment by Kiev to sign the deal, but he had received no response.  \\"Work on hold, had no answer,\\" he tweeted.  Last month, Kiev spurned the agreement in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, and the prime minister's Sunday night interview revealed new details about that relationship.  Azarov said that in addition to the trade relations deal, he hoped an agreement could be reached Tuesday on gas commerce, which would hopefully provide a solution for Ukraine's unprofitable gas transportation system.  \\"We hope to renew negotiations about the three-party consortium, which would include Europe as well, to provide transparent conditions for gas transit and gas transportation system management,\\" Azarov said.  However, Azarov rejected claims that Ukraine is leaning toward joining Russia and other former Soviet republics in the Customs Union.  Answer this series of questions: 1.

Title: A different calculator Review: If you don't want a TI then these are great calculators. I never really used TIs and when I finally needed to buy a graphing calculator I got this one instead of a TI because I was told HPs are better for engineers and that this calculator was going to be more powerful as well. That may be true, but so far I haven't seen a huge difference between the two.It's a good calculator by any means and I'm happy with it, but I'd only really recommend it to people who don't like TIs or need the specific features of the HP because most people out there are going to have TIs and you are going to have to learn how to do everything on the HP on your own. This may pay off down the road, but unless you are absolutely a full time user of calculators, it's a bit of a pain. Answer: A:","output":"Yes, the product review is mostly positive. The reviewer appreciates the calculator as an alternative to TI models and believes it is a good calculator overall. They mention that they are happy with their purchase. However, the reviewer also suggests that it may only be a better choice for those who specifically dislike TIs or require the unique features of the HP calculator. They note that using an HP calculator may require self-learning since most people use TIs, which may be a disadvantage for casual calculator users."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\"?

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Why did Meade lose his civil rights?

In a new release Thursday, WikiLeaks announced what it's calling \\"The Detainee Policies,\\" a collection of more than a hundred once-secret files outlining America's military detainee practices from Guantanamo to Iraq since 2002. WikiLeaks says it plans to release the files in chronological order to paint a picture of the evolution of America's military detainee practices since September 11th in prisons from Guantanamo to Iraq to Europe.      Unlike other recent releases, with the Detainee Policies WikiLeaks seems to be focusing on history more than news: Its first release is the 2002 Guantanamo Camp Delta standard operating procedure manual, a kind of prequel to the 2003 and 2004 manuals from camp it's already published in past years. Other documents in the collection, WikiLeaks says, will show American attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying the process of entering them into the detainment system's records, or detail psychological torture methods.      \\"[The document collection] shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later,\\" Assange writes in a statement to the press. \\"We call upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists and the public to mine the 'Detainee Policies' and investigate important issues...to help us better understand the evolution in these policies and why they have occurred.\\"      WikiLeaks' latest publication breaks with its two previous releases of 2012 from the private intelligence firm Stratfor and the Syrian government, both of which consisted of millions of hacked emails rather than a small collection of leaked documents. Just how WikiLeaks obtained the new documents isn't clear--its anonymous submission system has been down for more than two years, with no new conduit for secure document leaks in sight.      Lately even members of Anonymous, the hacker group that has long supported WikiLeaks and took credit for supplying the Syria and Stratfor leaks, publicly broke with the group after it created a donation-based paywall around its content. With the Detainee Policies, however, WikiLeaks seems to have removed that pop-up fundraising page.      Guantanamo and the fate of its non-citizen detainees has been a recurring theme for WikiLeaks, beginning with its leak in 2007 of the 2003 operating manual for the camp through its 2011 release of 759 Guantanamo detainees' secret files.      With WikiLeaks' founder now cooped up in London's Ecuadorean embassy and facing potential criminal charges in the United States, the subject may weigh on Assange's mind more than ever.

The latest release by the anti-secrecy site comes as Assange, who faces charges of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, remains holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London with what Quito says are health problems.      Assange said in a statement that the newly released documents exposed military detention policies at camps in Iraq and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.      Among the documents is the 2002 manual for staff at Camp Delta at Guantanamo, shortly after it was set up by US President George W. Bush to house alleged Al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees from the \\"war on terror\\".      \\"This document is of significant historical importance. Guantanamo Bay has become the symbol for systematised human rights abuse in the West with good reason,\\" said Assange, the founder of the website.      He added: \\"'The 'Detainee Policies' show the anatomy of the beast that is post-9/11 detention, the carving out of a dark space where law and rights do not apply, where persons can be detained without a trace at the convenience of the US Department of Defense.      \\"It shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown 'enemy' and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later.\\"      US President Barack Obama vowed within hours of taking office in January 2009 that he would close Guantanamo Bay, saying it was acting as a recruiting tool for Islamist extremists.      But Obama has so far failed to do so in the face of deep opposition in Congress to moving inmates to the US mainland, and several people accused of involvement in the 9/11 plots are on trial at the camp.      WikiLeaks first enraged Washington in 2010 by publishing a flood of secret military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a huge cache of diplomatic cables from US embassies across the world.      Assange, 41, walked into the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19 seeking asylum in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces questioning over alleged rape and sexual assault.      He was granted asylum on August 16 but Britain has refused to grant him safe passage out of the country, and he remains in the embassy.      Ecuador said on Wednesday it has requested a meeting with Britain to discuss the health of Assange, who it says is losing weight and suffering vision problems.      Copyright © 2012 AFP.

One of its more notable releases is called \\"The Detainee Policies,\\" which comprises over a hundred once-secret files outlining America's military detainee practices from Guantanamo to Iraq since 2002. The files reveal the evolution of the U.S. military's detainee practices in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, shining a light on the treatment of detainees and the conditions they faced in various detention facilities. These documents exposed the darker side of the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which has been a symbol of human rights abuse in the Western world. The disclosure of Camp Delta's standard operating procedure manual from 2002, psychological torture methods, and attempts to \\"disappear\\" detainees by delaying their entry into the detainment system's records were some of the primary focuses in this collection of leaked files. Julian Assange's intention behind releasing these files is to uncover important issues related to the detainee policies, understanding their development, and scrutinizing the reasons behind their existence. He calls upon lawyers, NGOs, human rights activists, and the public to utilize these documents to investigate and raise awareness about the injustices faced by detainees in these facilities. WikiLeaks obtained these documents from an unknown source, as its anonymous submission system has been down for more than two years. Despite facing potential criminal charges in the United States and ongoing issues with the British government, Assange continues to release valuable information in the public interest through the WikiLeaks platform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Alkalinity is the name given to the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution to neutralize an acid, measuring alkalinity is important in determining a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain, or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions, and which ph? Answer:","output":"Alkalinity is a key parameter in assessing the buffering capacity of an aqueous solution, specifically its ability to neutralize acids and resist changes in pH. In the context of a stream's ability to counteract acidic pollution such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation, alkalinity plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Acid rain or acidic precipitation is characterized by its unusually high concentrations of hydrogen ions (H+), which lower the pH of the water. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being considered neutral. Acidic substances have a pH less than 7, while alkaline substances have a pH greater than 7. Acid rain typically has a pH between 4.2 and 4.4, but can be as low as 2 in some cases. When assessing a stream's ability to neutralize acidic pollution, measuring alkalinity helps determine the degree to which the stream can buffer and maintain a stable pH. Alkalinity in water primarily comes from the presence of carbonate ions (CO3 2-), bicarbonate ions (HCO3 -), and hydroxide ions (OH-). These ions react with hydrogen ions, effectively neutralizing the acid and preventing drastic pH changes. A higher alkalinity indicates a greater buffering capacity to withstand acidic input. Healthy freshwater ecosystems usually have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5, which provides optimal living conditions for most aquatic organisms. Therefore, when measuring the alkalinity of a stream that can effectively neutralize acidic pollution from acid rain or other acidic precipitation, one would expect to see a pH value within this range. However, it is important to note that the specific pH requirement may vary depending on the particular species inhabiting the water. In summary, alkalinity represents the quantitative capacity of an aqueous solution, such as a stream, to neutralize acid and is essential in determining the stream's ability to cope with acidic pollution, such as acid rain or other forms of acidic precipitation. Ideal alkalinity would maintain the pH of the stream within the range of 6.5 to 8.5, which supports the health of most freshwater ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Gang of bikers attack driver in front of family after high-speed chase An unidentified 30-year-old man was attacked in front of his wife in child in New York City after his vehicle was pursued by a gang of motorcyclists in a high speed chase. It is not clear what started the altercation, but a video apparently taken by one of the bikers shows the gang surrounding the man’s Range Rover SUV on Manhattan’s West Side Highway Monday afternoon, the New York Post reports. In the video, at least one biker is seen slowing down and parking his bike in front of the man’s vehicle, causing him to stop. Another biker began walking threateningly toward the vehicle before the driver gunned it and smashed into several bikes and riders. The group then pursued the driver at high speeds until he got caught in traffic. At that point, another biker tried to rip open the SUV’s door, but the driver sped off again. The chase came to an end in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights when the driver was caught in traffic a second time. One biker in the video is shown ripping off his helmet and using it to smash the driver-side window of the SUV. Police sources told the New York Post that the man was slashed in front of his wife and child, who were inside the vehicle. The man was brought to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital to get stitches. New York police are investigating the attack and have not yet made any arrests. Click for more from the New York Post.

Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper. Such keywords can be directly from the given abstract or outside it. Q: Abstract: The objective of this study was to find naturally occurring anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), Graves' disease (GD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sera from normal subjects were tested for the presence of anti-Id antibodies against mouse anti-hTg monoclonal antibodies (McAb) in indirect ELISA and in indirect solid-phase RIA. Microtitration plates were coated with six McAb, five of them directed against different epitopes on hTg molecule, and then incubated with patients' sera. The bound antibody was detected with either peroxidase or 125I-labeled anti-human IgG. The specific positive reaction was observed in four of 40 patients with HT, in two of 26 patients with GD, in seven of 58 patients with RA, and in none of 20 normal subjects. The detected binding was due to the presence of anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies and not to Tg-anti-Tg circulating immune complexes, as the positive sera did not contain hTg when resolved on SDS-PAGE, nor did they bind to all anti-hTg McAb tested. The binding was dose dependent, and titers of anti-Id antibodies varied from 1:243 to 1:2187. The binding could be inhibited up to 50% by hTg, but not by the thyroid microsomal antigen, indicating that some of those anti-Id might represent the internal image of the antigen. Serum from the patient 3403, showing the strongest reactivity against McAb A-3, was chosen for IgG purification and F(ab')2 fragment isolation. The 3403 F(ab')2 fragment, but not the Fc fragment, was found to react specifically with four mouse anti-hTg McAb but not with the control mouse IgG. Thus, the obtained results permit the conclusion that anti-hTg anti-Id antibodies could occur naturally during the course of thyroid autoimmune disorders. A:","output":"anti-idiotypic antibodies in autoimmune thyroid disease To come up with this answer, I identified the main focus of the study from the abstract, which was to find \\"anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies to anti-human thyroglobulin (anti-hTg) idiotype in sera of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\\" This phrase captures the key element of the research and its contribution to the understanding of autoimmune thyroid disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Find the phone number: Before dialing, make sure you have the phone number of the person or business you wish to call. The number should consist of an area code (if required) and the local number. 2. Prepare the rotary phone: Place the rotary phone on a flat surface, like a table or desk, and ensure that the phone line is connected to the wall. 3. Pick up the handset: Lift the handset off the phone, and hold it to your ear. You should hear a dial tone. This signifies that the phone line is active and ready for you to dial the number. 4. Dial the area code (if required): If you need to include an area code, locate the first digit of the area code on the rotary dial. With your finger in the hole, rotate the dial clockwise until it reaches the metal stopper. Release the dial, allowing it to return to its starting position. Repeat this process for each digit of the area code. Remember to wait for the dial to return to its starting position before moving on to the next digit. 5. Dial the local number: Dial the local number by rotating the dial for each digit, just as you did for the area code. Ensure you wait for the dial to return to its starting position between each digit. 6. Allow the phone to connect: Once you have finished dialing the complete phone number, the telephone network will begin to connect your call. After a few seconds, you should hear ringing on the other end. Wait for the person you are calling to answer the phone. 7. Speak with the person: When the person on the other end picks up, you can begin your conversation. Hold the handset close to your mouth and speak clearly. 8. End the call: Once you finish your conversation, gently place the handset back onto the cradle of the phone. This action disconnects the call and returns the phone to a ready state for the next call. By following these steps, you'll successfully make a call on an old rotary phone while respecting the mechanical process involved in dialing and connecting to the desired phone number."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Heat oil in a pan and add some kernels of corn. cook until it begins to pop, cover and finish.. B. Put the corn in foil with oil, throw it on the low grill and cook and shake until it's done popping..","output":"I choose option A.  Here's how I would make popcorn, step by step, following option A: 1. Gather the necessary ingredients and utensils, including popcorn kernels, oil, a large pan with a lid, and a heatproof spatula. 2. Place the pan on the stovetop, and add an appropriate amount of oil. This may vary depending on the size of the pan, but generally, a thin layer that covers the entire bottom of the pan is sufficient. 3. Turn on the stove to medium heat, allowing the oil to warm up evenly. The proper temperature is important for effective popping. It would be good to also test if the oil is hot enough by dropping one or two kernels; if they pop quickly, the oil is ready. 4. Once the oil reaches the correct temperature, add a single layer of kernels to the pan, ensuring they are evenly distributed in the oil. It is necessary not to overcrowd the pan to prevent some kernels from burning before others have a chance to pop. 5. As soon as the first few kernels begin to pop, quickly place the lid on the pan to avoid any popped corn from flying out of the pan and to keep in the steam that helps the kernels pop. 6. Using a heatproof spatula, occasionally shake the pan gently to move the kernels around, preventing them from burning at the bottom of the pan, promoting even heat distribution, and encouraging more kernels to pop. 7. Keep cooking the kernels until the popping significantly slows down or ceases. At this point, it is safe to assume that most of the kernels have popped. 8. Turn off the heat and, carefully using an oven mitt or heatproof handle if necessary, remove the pan from the stove. Wait for a few seconds for any last few pops, and then slowly lift the lid away from your face to avoid any steam. 9. Pour the popped popcorn into a large bowl and season it to taste with salt, butter, or your preferred spices and enjoy. I choose this option because it is a simple yet effective way of making popcorn, and it allows for more control over the cooking process. This method is also widely used and produces consistent results."},{"instruction":"The Towle WC aka Towle TA-1 was a custom built aircraft for a 1929 round-the world flight.

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report. Question: The reason why \\"Apple a day may poison children\\"  is that   _  . - there are some pests in the apple - children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple - there are always more pesticides on the apples produced in Britain - the apple is too hard for children to eat The answer is:","output":"children would get a poisonous level of pesticides because of the remains on the apple"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he's talking about (nor do we). It was like the engine died and was restarted. The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting. Nothing I haven't seen on the TV Series. Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced. Seann William Scott's awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof). I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear. Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. That's telling you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices.

The first officers arrived at the American Civic Association about three minutes after the first emergency calls were made Friday, according to a timeline by the Binghamton Police Department. Zikuski said the first 911 calls were in \\"broken","output":"English,\\" making it difficult for police to understand the situation immediately. But they quickly reached the scene and tried their best to help people there. In the end, 13 people were killed, and the gunman, Jiverly Wong, also died. The police and authorities said they did their best, and their actions didn't cause the people to die. People in the city will be very sad, and they will have funerals for those who were killed. It's a sad ending to the story, with many people hurting and trying to understand why it happened."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given an input stream, and your task is to produce a grammatically correct version of the input sentence.

August 14, 2000 saw the introduction of what kids animated character, known for a monkey named Boots, a fox named Swiper, and her frequent use of Spanish????","output":"August 14, 2000, saw the introduction of a beloved character in children's television, Dora Marquez, better known as Dora the Explorer. Dora is a young Latina girl who goes on various adventures in an animated world with her talking purple backpack and an anthropomorphic monkey named Boots. Created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh, and Eric Weiner, the show 'Dora the Explorer' debuted on Nickelodeon and is popular among pre-school age children. Dora was designed to introduce viewers to Spanish. Throughout each episode, Dora teaches Spanish words or phrases to the viewers. For instance, she often asks viewers to say a Spanish word or phrase along with her to overcome a problem. This interactive component quickly became a signature part of the show, contributing to its popularity and success. Plus, making language learning a part of an epic adventure with fun characters makes the learning feel more like play than a chore. The anthropomorphic blue-booted monkey named Boots is Dora's best friend and main travel companion. He's called Boots because of his striking red boots. Boots is always seen on Dora's various trips and provides her assistance and information during their adventures. His friendly, enthusiastic personality, and undying optimism, charm children who are watching. The character of Swiper is a sneaky fox who tries to throw Dora and Boots off track during their missions. Swiper is always out to steal something from Dora, hence the name \\"Swiper\\". Dora and Boots often prevent Swiper from stealing by saying, \\"Swiper, no swiping!\\" three times. Despite his usual antagonistic role, Swiper is not a traditional villain. At times, he's shown to have a good heart and even helps Dora and Boots on occasion. The show gained massive popularity and critical acclaim globally not only for its entertainment value but also for its educational content. Dora the Explorer was a trailblazing show that popularized the incorporation of learning a foreign language into kid's TV programs. Over the years, it has inspired several spin-offs, merchandise, video games, and even a live-action movie adaptation. It has left a remarkable impact on kids' TV programming and continues to be loved by many."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jony Ive appeared to attack the Moto Maker scheme in an interview in which he criticised the idea of giving consumers huge choice over how their handsets were made to appear. Rick Osterloh, president of Motorola, told the BBC his company had a \\"different philosophy\\". And he criticised Apple in turn, calling its prices \\"outrageous\\". Sir Jonathan specifically asked the New Yorker magazine not to name the company he had been \\"scathing about\\", but a campaign launched by Motorola in late 2013 matches the description he gave. \\"Their value proposition was, 'Make it whatever you want. You can choose whatever colour you want,'\\"  Sir Jonathan is quoted as saying. \\"And I believe that's abdicating your responsibility as a designer.\\" Motorola promotes Moto Maker as offering shoppers \\"thousands of ways\\" to customise its Android-powered Moto X handsets. Choices include the colour of the model's back, the type of metal trim used and the option to include a variety of leathers in its design. Mr Osterloh of the scheme: \\"Our belief is that the end user should be directly involved in the process of designing products. \\"We're making the entire product line accessible. \\"And frankly, we're taking a directly opposite approach to them [Apple].\\" He added that he believed this difference in strategy went wider than design. \\"We do see a real dichotomy in this marketplace, where you've got people like Apple making so much money and charging such outrageous prices. We think that's not the future,\\" he said. \\"We believe the future is in offering similar experiences and great consumer choice at accessible prices. \\"The mobile phone industry's greatest failure is also its greatest opportunity: to make really good, affordable devices for people who don't want to spend a lot of money. \\"A great smartphone, and a great mobile internet experience, shouldn't be an expensive luxury. It should be a simple choice for everyone.\\" Motorola launched Moto Maker while owned by Google, but it has since become a division of China's Lenovo. Sir Jonathan - who was knighted in 2012 for his services to design - was also critical of another brand, in the New Yorker article, suggesting Toyota's Echo model was \\"shocking\\". \\"It is baffling, isn't it? It's just nothing, isn't it? It's just insipid,\\" he said of the vehicle, which is also sold as the Yaris. A spokeswoman for Toyota declined to comment.

Brannan's ex-girlfriend Christine Corley says that he falsely accused her of hitting him and is a 'master manipulator' Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Tennis Pro Accused of Assault: The Twisted Tale of Ivan Brannan, Master Manipulator In a recent shocking revelation, Ivan Brannan, 28, has accused a professional tennis player of assaulting him in a Florida gym on Valentine's Day. Brannan, a former tennis prodigy himself, has been embroiled in a tumultuous relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley, who now claims that Brannan is a \\"master manipulator\\" and has a history of making false accusations. The alleged assault reportedly occurred on the romantic holiday, when Brannan claims that he had been punched by the unnamed tennis pro. The incident has sent shockwaves through the sports community, as it would signify severe misconduct on the part of a professional athlete. A police report has been filed, and an investigation is currently underway to determine the veracity of Brannan's allegations. However, it seems that Brannan's credibility is being called into question by none other than his ex-girlfriend, Christine Corley. In an exclusive interview, Corley revealed that Brannan had falsely accused her of hitting him in the past. She described her former flame as a \\"master manipulator\\" with a penchant for twisting the truth to serve his purposes. Corley's allegations against Brannan paint a troubling picture of a man who may stop at nothing to create drama and attention. In her words, Brannan used the accusations against her to manipulate and control her, turning their relationship into a toxic, emotionally fraught experience. With her account in mind, it begs the question: could Brannan be fabricating the assault charges against the tennis pro? While the investigation is still ongoing, the unraveling story raises important concerns about character assassination and the consequences of manipulating the truth. Not only do false allegations damage the reputations of the accused, but they also have a lasting impact on the credibility of actual victims of assault. Should Brannan's claims prove to be unfounded, there may be severe repercussions for both his reputation and the credibility of similar accusations in the future. In the world of professional sports, personal drama can often overshadow the talent and dedication of athletes. Fans and the media alike have long been captivated by controversies and scandals. However, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and recognize the importance of due process, especially when dealing with serious accusations like Brannan's. As the investigation into these allegations continues, it remains to be seen whether Ivan Brannan's claims hold any truth or if they are simply the machinations of a \\"master manipulator\\". Either way, it is a disheartening story that reminds us that even in the world of professional sports, personal drama can still cast a long shadow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, to ensure Perseus doesn't receive unfair help from other gods, Zeus declares that only one gift may be offered to him - Athena's intellect and wisdom. Thus, Zeus commands Athena to give Perseus her legendary and wise owl, Bubo. The owl Bubo is gifted to Perseus and serves as a wise and intelligent guide to help him fulfill this impossible task. They set off on their journey, gathering a crew of skilled warriors and misfits, each with unique abilities crucial to the success of their quest. Together, they embark on an epic adventure through a mythological world filled with treacherous landscapes, cursed creatures, and powerful sorcery. As their journey unfolds, they uncover a fiendish plot orchestrated by Hades, the God of the Underworld, who seeks to usurp Zeus and seize control of the heavens. To do so, Hades conspires with titans and monsters long thought vanquished, terrorizing the world and provoking chaos. Perseus and his crew must navigate the twisted machinations of divine politics and confront their own inner fears as they draw closer to their final confrontation with Hades. The climax of the film sees Perseus and his companions infiltrate Hades' stronghold within the Underworld, where they must face their most lethal trials yet. Through their courage, cunning, and the wise guidance of Bubo, they thwart Hades' minions and persevere against overwhelming odds. With the celestial realm hanging in the balance, Perseus confronts Hades in an epic battle of power, fate, and destiny. In the end, Perseus triumphs, not through brute force but through his wisdom and intellect, revealing the true power of Zeus and Athena's gift. The gods, humbled by the might of Perseus' resilience and wisdom, finally recognize the importance of harmony and balance between the celestial and mortal worlds. Zeus restores peace among the gods and decrees that they must act with restraint in guiding humanity's destiny. With his quest complete, Perseus returns to the mortal realm as a legend, the embodiment of wisdom and heroism. The tale of his divine quest and triumph echoes through the ages, inspiring countless generations to strive for wisdom and greatness in the face of adversity. The Divine Quest of Perseus is an epic cinematic experience that showcases the power of wisdom, the importance of balance, and the potential for greatness hidden within every mortal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Title: Great App with Room for Improvement Review: I have been using the de.danoeh.antennapod app for the last few months and overall, it’s been a good experience worthy of a 4-star rating. My favorite highlight of the app has to be the user-friendly interface. It is easy to navigate through the app and find all its features which prove to be quite impressive. The functionality to download podcasts and listen to them offline is something I frequently use, and the quality of audio is truly commendable.  Moreover, the feature of automatic deletion of episodes post their playback contributes significantly to managing the phone's storage, adding more convenience to the user experience. The app also houses a wide variety of podcasts catering to different range of tastes, which is quite vibrant and fascinating. Despite the praise, the reason I am holding back a star for now is because there’s always room for improvement. On a few occasions, the app has crashed unexpectedly during conveniently timed auto-updates. The stability could be improved for a seamless experience that such a great platform deserves. Also, the search function could do with a bit of tweaking to deliver more precise results. In conclusion, the de.danoeh.antennapod App is undeniably a great platform for podcast lovers, and with some minor updates, it can reach its full potential of being a top-tier application.  Steps to generate the review: 1. Considering the rating level, which is 4-star, the review should be overall positive but with a few constructive criticisms.  2. I start the review by acknowledging the user's overall satisfaction with the app that justifies the 4-star rating. 3. The review then goes into the specifics of what the user likes about the app. Good elements to consider are user-interface, audio quality, features like offline listening and automatic deletion of played episodes, and available choices. 4.

Visited Moe's for the first time in about a year for their birthday promo (Free Burrito w/ purchase of a large drink), and I have to say I was let down relative to my relatively mild expectations.  On a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine.  They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand.  Relative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build-your-own Mexican bar.  Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best.  The \\"free\\" chips with every meal (I hate these type of sales gimmicks) are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare.

Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away.

No If I tell you that A solar panel converts sunlight into electrons in motion, and ask you the question \\"what does a solar panel convert sunlight into?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"adding heat.\\" A solar panel converts sunlight into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation of how solar panels work and the process of converting sunlight into electricity. A solar panel, also known as a photovoltaic (PV) module, is made up of numerous solar cells. These cells are typically made from silicon, a semiconductor material that is abundant in the Earth's crust. The silicon cells in the solar panels can be either monocrystalline or polycrystalline. The process of converting sunlight into electricity using a solar panel involves the following steps: 1. Absorption of sunlight: When sunlight, in the form of photons, strikes the surface of the solar panel, it may either be absorbed by the solar cells, reflected off the surface, or pass through the panel. 2. Generation of electron-hole pairs: When photons with sufficient energy are absorbed by the semiconductor material in the solar cells, they transfer their energy to the electrons present in the material's atoms. This energy transfer causes the electrons to break free from their parent atoms, leaving behind an empty space called a \\"hole.\\" This generation of free electrons and holes is the initial step in the conversion of sunlight into electricity. 3. Separation of charge carriers: In a solar cell, a p-n junction is created by introducing impurities into the semiconductor material. The p-n junction separates the solar cell into two regions with different electric charge concentrations: the p-type region with an excess of positive charges, and the n-type region with an excess of negative charges. When free electrons and holes are generated by the absorption of sunlight, they are quickly separated by the electric field established at the p-n junction. The electrons move towards the n-type region, while the holes travel towards the p-type region. 4. Collection of charge carriers: As the negatively charged electrons are attracted towards the n-type region and the positively charged holes towards the p-type region, these charge carriers are collected by metal contacts placed on the top and bottom surfaces of the solar cell. This creates a flow of electric current from the top contact to the bottom contact. 5. Conversion of direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC): The current generated by a solar panel is direct current (DC). However, most electrical devices and appliances used in homes and businesses operate on alternating current (AC). Therefore, the DC current generated by the solar panel needs to be converted into AC using a device called an inverter. In summary, a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity by absorbing photons, generating free electrons and holes, separating the charge carriers, collecting them via metal contacts to produce an electric current, and finally, converting the generated direct current into alternating current for use in homes and businesses. The process of converting sunlight into electricity in a solar panel does not involve \\"adding heat.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue found in many areas of the body, including the joints, ears, nose, bronchial tubes, and between the bones of the spine and ribs. It's a flexible and robust material that functions to support, connect, and cushion various body structures. The fundamental component of cartilage is a protein called collagen, which arranges itself into an overlapping network of long, thin structures known as fibrils. These fibrils intertwine and bundle together to provide cartilage with its characteristic strength and elasticity. Let's debunk the other choices:  - A cuticle, in biology, refers to the outermost protective layer found in various organisms like plants and insects. It is non-living material and is not a part of human cartilage. - Bones are rigid structures that make up the skeleton. They provide support and protection for the body and are not a part of the cartilage, although they do interact with cartilage. - Joules is a unit of measurement for energy or work in the International System of Units. It is utterly unrelated to the biological makeup of cartilage. - Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system. They are specialized cells that are involved in transmitting signals and carrying out the functions of the nervous system. They are not involved in the structure of cartilage. - The skin is the body's largest organ. It serves to protect the body from the outside environment. While skin and cartilage both fall under the category of connective tissue, they are composed of different types of cells and serve different functions. - Loose soil does not have any association with cartilage. This term is a geologic concept and is irrelevant to the composition of cartilage. - Muscles are tissue that contracts and relaxes to create movement.

Your fast and weight loss goals can cause stress, leading to an increase in cortisol. Try relaxation strategies such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or a hobby to help you lower your stress.  Try coloring. Go for a stroll in nature. Journal your thoughts. Read a book. Talk things out with a friend. Listen to calming music. Snuggle with a pet or family member. If you spend time around food, you’ll think about it for the rest of the day. For example, avoid going out to lunch with friends while you're fasting. Similarly, tuning into a TV show about baking will spark cravings. Replace activities that revolve around food with other activities that will occupy your mind.  Focus on your faith through prayer, reflection, reading your Quran, and attending religious services. Play a game with friends, such as a board game. Read a book. Ask to hold your work meetings in the boardroom or in someone’s office. A goal of Ramadan is to be charitable and think of others, so volunteer to help those in the community. You can help a nonprofit, support people through your mosque, or visit those in need.  Make meals for others. Visit with the sick. Donate your skills to a charity. Bring items that you no longer use to those who are in need. Ramadan is a holy holiday, so it makes sense to spend plenty of time in prayer. You can also use prayer as a way to keep your mind off food while deepening your faith.  If you start to think about food, turn your thoughts to prayer. Consider keeping a prayer on you to read when your thoughts are muddled. This way you can still engage in prayer even if you’re feeling distracted. You are encouraged to read your Quran during Ramadan, and doing so can help you remember why you are celebrating Ramadan. Instead of your thoughts being consumed with your desire to eat before fasting begins again at sunrise, you can reflect on the teachings and your beliefs. What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a shorter and simpler explanation of the main points in a longer text. For this article, the summary would be: Stress can make you hungrier, so try relaxing activities to help you during fasting and weight loss. Avoid being around food and try other things instead, like playing games or reading. Praying, volunteering, and reading religious books can help you stay focused during Ramadan. This way, you can focus on the important parts of the holiday and not just think about food."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Given the question: Process: - A bird lays eggs in a nest - The parent(s) incubate the eggs - The eggs hatch - The mother (and sometimes the father) bird take care of the baby birds - The baby birds grow up and get their flight feathers - The young birds learn to fly and leave the nest - The adult birds find mates and mate.  Question: suppose Predator tries to eat more eggs happens, how will it affect LESS birds.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"If a predator tries to eat more eggs, it will result in fewer birds. The increase in predation will reduce the number of eggs that hatch and survive, which directly affects the second effect mentioned, which is the incubation of eggs by the parent(s). This increased predation would have a negative impact on the bird population, as fewer eggs will survive to hatch, reducing the number of baby birds that can be taken care of by the mother and/or father. Consequently, fewer baby birds will grow up, develop flight feathers, learn to fly, leave the nest, and eventually find mates and mate themselves. As mentioned, the increased predation influences the second effect by causing fewer birds, specifically leading to less successful incubation of the eggs by the parent(s) due to the reduced number of eggs that are able to hatch and survive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Kidneys The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure. The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You may have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form).

Desktop users may find the USB ports on the back or the front of the desktop tower, though iMacs have the USB ports on the back of the monitor itself. There are two main types of USB ports found on modern computers:   USB 3.0 — A thin, rectangular slot that's about 3/4 of an inch (a little under two centimeters) wide. You should see a chunk of plastic in the upper half of this slot. USB 3.0 slots are found on the majority of Windows computers and on most Mac computers manufactured prior to 2016.  USB-C — A thin, oval slot that's about 1/2 of an inch (a little over a centimeter) wide. These are most commonly found on MacBook and MacBook Pro computers, though some Windows laptops also have USB-C ports. If your computer has both types of port, you're free to use whichever port you like depending on your USB flash drive type. Look at the metal connector end of your flash drive:  If the connector is rectangular and has a piece of plastic taking up part of the connector, you have a USB 3.0 flash drive. If the connector is oval and has no piece of plastic inside of it, you have a USB-C flash drive. If the flash drive that you want to use is a USB 3.0 version but your computer uses USB-C ports, you'll need to buy a USB-C adapter and plug it into the USB-C port on your computer. This is most common on MacBooks and MacBook Pros from 2016 and up, though some Windows computers also have only USB-C ports. If you're using a USB 3.0 flash drive, make sure that the plastic piece in the flash drive's connector is at the bottom of the flash drive so as to slide under the piece of plastic that's at the top of the USB 3.0 port.  USB-C flash drives can be inserted either way. If you're using a USB-C adapter, you'll plug your USB flash drive into a USB 3.9 slot in the adapter instead.

Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity. In addition to hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show, he's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male-dominated writer's room. Comediennes LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones tried out for the opening cast member position last month, and the show's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes. Scroll down for video. New hires: LaKendra Tookes (left) and Leslie Jones (right) were hired as Saturday Night Live writers after auditioning for a cast member position last month. They will join a mostly white male-dominated writer's room  on the sketch comedy show as creator Lorne Michaels seeks to address lack of diversity complaints. The new writer announcement comes after Zamata's hiring was made official on Monday.  Zamata will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Jones was a finalist for Zamata's cast member slot, and has guest starred on such shows as The League and Sullivan & Son. She has performed at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and her stand-up special 'Problem Child' was broadcast on Showtime. Tookes on the other hand is a former news reporter from Florida who has performed her comedy at iO West theater in Los Angeles. While neither women is slated to perform on the show, many SNL writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer. Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis made the jump, as well as current featured player Mike O'Brien. Hired: It was announced on Monday that Sasheer Zamata will be the newest addition to Saturday Night Live, filling a black female cast member void created when Maya Rudolph left the show in 2007. Live from New York: Zamata will make her debut on Saturday Night Live during the January 18 episode hosted by Drake. Rumors that a new player might be added. to the cast started last month, when Gothamist reported that auditions. were held earlier at the Groundlings theater for black. female comediennes in LA. The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times. that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the. first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels. also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was. initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He. saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their. performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for. the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels. says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of. the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them. into the last episodes of the season. While many have criticized the show. for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady. Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do. with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live. has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the. 1985-86 season on the show. No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since. The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no. sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season, excepting the episode which was hosted by Kerry Washington. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Maya Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past. 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels has addressed concerns about the show's lack of diversity by hiring stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata as a new cast member and adding two new black comediennes, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones, to the writer's room.

They retrieved over 86 New England prisoners taken by the Indians. One of these operations resulted in the Battle at Winnepang , in which 35 Indians and five New Englanders were killed. Only five Indian bodies were recovered from the battle, and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso's new fort. During the war, a church was erected at the Catholic mission in the Mi'kmaq village of Shubenacadie . In 1723, the village of Canso, Nova Scotia was raided again by the Mi'kmaqs, who killed five fishermen, so the New Englanders built a 12-gun blockhouse to guard the village and fishery.:62 The worst moment of the war for Annapolis Royal came on July 4, 1724 when a group of 60 Mi'kmaqs and Maliseets raided the capital. They killed and scalped a sergeant and a private, wounded four more soldiers, and terrorized the village. They also burned houses and took prisoners.:164-165 The New Englanders responded by executing one of the Mi'kmaq hostages on the same spot where the sergeant was killed. They also burned three Acadian houses in retaliation. As a result of the raid, three blockhouses were built to protect the town. The Acadian church was moved closer to the fort so that it could be more easily monitored.

The competition was established in 1994 and is held biennially, under the guidance and organization of the PGA Tour. The President's Cup follows a format similar to that of the Ryder Cup, comprising various types of matches, including Foursomes, Fourballs, and Singles. Over the four-day event, a total of 30 points are up for grabs, with each match contributing 1 point. The event has been held for 13 editions, and the distribution of matches and points has slightly evolved over the years. Since 2015, the point structure has been as follows: - On Day 1, there are 5 Fourball matches - On Day 2, there are 5 Foursomes matches - On Day 3, there are 4 Fourball matches in the morning and 4 Foursomes matches in the afternoon - On Day 4, there are 12 Singles matches Thus, a total of 30 points are available, and a team needs to score at least 15.5 points to secure a win. If the overall score is tied at 15-15 at the end of the competition, the President's Cup is shared between the two teams, and both the teams are declared co-champions.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context states that if a person cannot measure the amount of detergent they've used when loading the dishwasher, it may potentially affect the dishwasher's cleaning performance. This statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the dishwasher will not clean as well, given inaccurate measurements of detergent used. Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process of dishwashing. The proper amount of detergent plays a crucial role in the dishwashing process, as it is responsible for breaking down and removing food particles, grease, and stains from the dishes. Insufficient detergent may not provide enough cleaning power, which might result in unclean dishes or spotting. Overuse of detergent, on the other hand, can cause excess foam and may damage the dishwasher itself, or leave a residue on the dishes. To minimize the impact of this perturbation, one could: 1. Use a well-formulated detergent or detergent pods that provide pre-measured amounts of detergent. This eliminates the need for the person to measure the detergent themselves. 2. Familiarize oneself with the manufacturer's recommended detergent amount. Dishwasher manuals and detergent packaging usually provide guidelines for appropriate detergent usage based on the dishwasher's size and the level of soil on the dishes. 3. Adjust detergent levels based on the hardness of the water. Hard water typically requires more detergent, while soft water requires less. By understanding local water conditions, one can use detergent more effectively and minimize the effects of the perturbation. In conclusion, the inability to measure the amount of detergent used does have an indirect effect on the dishwashing process. To achieve optimal cleaning performance, using the correct amount of detergent is essential. Implementing the aforementioned precautions can help minimize the impact of this perturbation on the dishwashing process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After first-half tries from Ollie Roberts, Jermaine McGillvary and Aaron Murphy, the Giants scored twice more within seven minutes of the restart through Paul Clough and Jordan Turner. Jake Mamo crossed too before McGillvary and Murphy each added a second. Mamo also had two tries chalked off, with Warrington's only response coming through a Tom Lineham try on 53 minutes. Former Salford, Hull and St Helens utility back Turner scored on his debut as Huddersfield's third victory in five matches moved them within a point of Catalans Dragons, who they face next Saturday. Turner, who joined from Canberra last week, was one of two changes, coupled with the key return from a two-match ban of half-back Brough, who kicked five goals. Warrington have now failed to win any of their last four games - and last season's beaten Grand Finalists remain in danger of finishing in the bottom four. This was Warrington's third game in nine days, while the Giants had enjoyed a nine-day gap since their last fixture. The Rugby Football League allowed last Monday's game with St Helens to be postponed as it clashed with co-tenants Huddersfield Town's Championship play-off final at Wembley.

After the previous 38-12 home defeat by Salford and the 40-0 loss at Leeds, Warrington's performance has been disappointing. The game saw the Giants securing eight tries, with debuts by Paul Clough, Jordan Turner, and Jake Mamo. Warrington's only response came through a Tom Lineham try on 53 minutes. Turner previously played for Salford, Hull, and St Helens, and his performance this game has brought Huddersfield within a point of Catalans Dragons.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: What is the most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trails? Options: - not enough information - to stop eating at night - to attempt to lose weight - to be able to eat more during the day A:","output":"The most probable reason why the participants decided to join the trials is: - to attempt to lose weight. The study focuses on weight loss and examines the effects of restricting night time eating. Participants would likely be interested in exploring this approach for weight loss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death?, using the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the more likely cause of death for Philip Heseltine, also known as the English composer Peter Warlock, is considered to be suicide. Several factors support this theory: 1. Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and his partner Barbara Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by coal gas poisoning. 2. The outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat, which might suggest that Heseltine was making final arrangements before taking his own life. 3. The fact that Heseltine placed his young cat outside the room before turning on the lethal gas could indicate a deliberate act, as he potentially wanted to take care of the animal before committing suicide. While Heseltine's son, Nigel Heseltine, later introduced a theory that his father was murdered by Bernard Van Dieren, this theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The overwhelming evidence and circumstances surrounding Heseltine's death have led most experts to believe that suicide is the more likely cause."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't know if this contains any spoilers or not, but I don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462. I disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *Guns, Germs and Steel* as \\"politically correct\\" and \\"neo-Marxist.\\" They cannot have watched the same series that *I* did. The series *I* watched depicted the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies. I saw nothing in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though Europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power.  I certainly saw nothing that could be construed as Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations. Otherwise, many African peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. At the time they were at the height of their successes, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so. Aboriginal American and Khoi-San populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples.)  So, I don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing *I* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I did not know by the time I finished seventh grade. There's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. It does, however, present some nice dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values are very high; and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in Mrs. Gruber's Sixth Hour Social Studies Class at Milan Middle School.

Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago, The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel \\"needs updating,\\" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame.

I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.)

Write an article based on this summary: Choose someone you trust. Consider age, health, and location of potential agents. Consider the agent's religion and lifestyle preferences.","output":"Title: Choosing the Ideal Trust Agent: What to Consider Introduction In life, it is crucial to have someone you can trust to act on your behalf, make decisions for you, or share sensitive information with, especially during critical moments. This person, known as a trust agent, must possess certain characteristics and share similar values with you. Selecting the perfect trust agent requires profound consideration. This article presents a guide on factors to consider when choosing a trust agent, including age, health, location, religion, and lifestyle preferences. 1. Age of Your Trust Agent The first aspect to consider when choosing a trust agent is their age. Understandably, a younger person might be more agile and innovative, while an older individual might possess more experience and wisdom. Therefore, it is important to weigh these factors and choose an age range that best suits your needs and expectations. Try to select someone who not only possesses maturity but also has the potential to adapt to future changes. 2. Health of Your Trust Agent In addition to age, the health of your potential trust agent is another critical factor. Your trust agent must be physically and mentally able to handle any responsibilities and tasks assigned to them. An individual with good health will have fewer limitations in making decisions and fulfilling their role effectively. It is important to have an honest conversation about their health status, ensuring that they are committed to the long-term responsibilities of being a trust agent. 3. Location of Your Trust Agent Geographical proximity can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of a trust agent. Ideally, your trust agent should be located within accessible distance, allowing prompt communication and decision-making when necessary. In cases where long-distance communication is unavoidable, it is essential to establish a dependable line of communication, either through phone calls, emails or video conferences. 4. Religion and Cultural Background of Your Trust Agent Religion and cultural background play an essential role in shaping a person's values, beliefs, and decision-making process. It is crucial to choose a trust agent who shares your religious and cultural values to ensure that the decisions made on your behalf align with your beliefs. Discussing significant religious or cultural practices relevant to you and your trust agent will help create a strong foundation for a successful, understanding partnership. 5. Lifestyle Preferences of Your Trust Agent Finally, lifestyle preferences should be taken into consideration when selecting an ideal trust agent. These preferences include factors such as their personal habits, hobbies, financial management, and professional endeavors. By selecting someone with similar lifestyle preferences, you ensure they can understand and address your concerns with empathy and familiarity. This congruence of preferences will enable your trust agent to make decisions that genuinely reflect your desired outcomes. Conclusion Selecting the right trust agent is a process that involves an evaluation of age, health, location, religion, cultural background, and lifestyle preferences. By carefully considering these factors, you can identify the ideal individual who will diligently and faithfully perform their role on your behalf. Remember that honest and open communication is key for establishing mutual understanding and trust between you and your chosen trust agent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms. The \\"ability of a system to perform work\\" is a common description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive definition of energy because of its many forms. For instance, in SI units, energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined \\"mechanically\\", being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient.  Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. All of the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy. In Newtonian physics, there is a universal law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed; however, it can change from one form to another.

The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.  - ELF Corporation ( or élf) was an eroge studio. One of its most popular games is \\"Dkysei\\", a pioneering dating sim, which has had a sequel, and been turned into video and TV series. The character design of the main villains from the \\"-saku\\" series is the company mascot. They are also known for role-playing video games such as the \\"Dragon Knight\\" series and visual novel adventure games such as \\"YU-NO\\".  - Dragon Knight II (II) is a fantasy-themed eroge role-playing video game in the \\"Dragon Knight\\" franchise that was originally developed and published by ELF Corporation in 1990-1991 only in Japan as the first sequel to the original \\"Dragon Knight\\" from 1989. The game is an erotic dungeon crawler in which a young warrior Takeru fights to lift a witch's curse that has turned girls into monsters.   - MSX is the name of a standardized home computer architecture, first announced by Microsoft on June 16, 1983, and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then Vice-president at Microsoft Japan and Director at ASCII Corporation. Microsoft conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various hardware makers of the period.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - An is a Japanese pornographic video game. History. Japanese eroge, also known as H-Light novels or hentai games, have their origins in the early 1980s, when Japanese companies introduced their own brands of microcomputer to compete with those of the United States. Competing systems included the Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7, MSX, and NEC PC-8801. NEC was behind its competitors in terms of hardware (with only 16 colors and no sound support) and needed a way to regain control of the market. Thus came the erotic game. The first commercial erotic computer game, \\"Night Life\\", was released by Koei in 1982. It was an early graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, \\"Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku\\" (\\"Seduction of the Condominium Wife\\"), which was an early role-playing adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Koei Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game publisher, developer, and distributor founded in 1978. The company is known for its historical simulation games based on the novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", as well as simulation games based on pseudo-historical events.  - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems.  - Knights of Xentar is an eroge role - playing video game published for the PC DOS in North America by Megatech Software in 1995 and has been originally published as Dragon Knight III in Japan in 1991 . It is part of the Dragon Knight series of games created by Japanese game developer ELF , who originally released the game for the NEC PC - 8801 computer in 1991 , followed by ports for the Sharp X68000 and PC Engine CD platforms . The game is a sequel of Dragon Knight and Dragon Knight II. Its gameplay system is different from that of previous installments of the Dragon Knight series , resembling this of the early Final Fantasy ( even more in the PC version ) series instead of first - person - view dungeon crawler , and enabling the player to explore the entire world of the game . Some of the characters were renamed in the in English and German localized Knights of Xentar release , including the protagonist Takeru 's name changed to Desmond .  - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86.

Additionally, cultural exchanges have been an essential element in forging close ties between Russia and the Muslim world. The interweaving of languages, arts, traditions, and beliefs has enriched both societies and played a significant role in forming their shared identity. There have been instances of religious integration as well, with Islamic communities residing in Russia for centuries. The history of the Tatars and the Volga Bulgars, as well as other nationalities, has demonstrated the Russian state's ability to interact harmoniously with the Muslim world in terms of religion and beliefs. In conclusion, the age-old connections between Russia and the Muslim world stand on the pillars of tolerance and mutual understanding. The realms of trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange have been instrumental in shaping these relations, which continue to grow and evolve today. As such, it is crucial for both parties to uphold these workable links to facilitate further cooperation and development in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: how to keep dates, from becoming gummy?","output":"Keeping dates from becoming gummy requires proper storage techniques, as well as careful handling during preparation. Dates have a naturally sticky texture due to their high sugar content (glucose and fructose). While this is one of the main reasons for their popularity, it can also make them challenging to work with. Here are some practical tips to avoid gummy dates: 1. Select high-quality dates: When purchasing dates, look for firm, plump, and shiny ones. The skin should not be broken or have any visible signs of mold. If the dates are packaged, make sure the container is airtight and properly sealed. 2. Store dates correctly: To maintain their texture and prevent them from becoming gummy, it is essential to store dates in a cool, dry, and dark place. You can keep them in an airtight container or plastic bag to protect them from humidity, heat, and air exposure. If you live in a hot and humid climate, consider storing dates in the refrigerator to extend their shelf life. 3. Cut the dates right before using: To prevent excessive sticking and gumminess, cut the dates just before incorporating them into your recipes. This will help maintain their texture and minimize the stickiness. 4. Dust with flour: If you're using dates in a baked item or mixing them with other ingredients, try lightly dusting them with a little bit of flour before cutting or blending. The flour will absorb some of their moisture and help prevent them from sticking together or becoming gummy. 5. Use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors: When chopping or cutting dates, use a sharp knife or kitchen scissors to make clean, smooth cuts. This will prevent the dates from getting squished or compressed, which can result in a gummy texture. 6. Oil your knife or scissors: To minimize sticking, lightly coat the blade of your knife or the blades of your scissors with cooking oil or non-stick cooking spray. This will help the dates slide off the blade more easily and reduce gumminess. 7. Pulse in a food processor: If you're using a food processor to chop or blend dates, pulse the machine in short bursts instead of continuously running it. This will help maintain the structure of the dates, preventing them from becoming over-processed and gummy. 8. Separate the dates: When layering or incorporating chopped dates into a recipe, gently separate any clumps of dates stuck together to ensure even distribution and minimize gumminess. 9. Rehydrate dry dates: If you're working with overly dry dates, rehydrate them by soaking in warm water or juice for about 10-15 minutes. Drain well and pat dry before using. This will revitalize their texture and make them less likely to become gummy. 10. Practice patience: When handling dates, it's essential to work gently and patiently. Avoid applying excessive pressure and take the time to separate sticky pieces if necessary. By following these tips, you will be better equipped to prevent dates from becoming gummy, ensuring your recipes turn out delicious with just the right texture."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Here is a news article: CLEVELAND, Tennessee- A popular clothing choice for young girls and women was recently put in check by a Tennessee woman who wanted to lay down the proper rules when it comes to wearing leggings.      Jamie Higdon Randolph from Cleveland, Tennessee recently posted a sassy video message to her Facebook page directed at women who like to wear ‘leggings.’      In her video titled, “Leggings ain’t pants,” Jamie said she was on her way to buy a new pair of leggings after she couldn’t find her own leggings and went to borrow a pair from her daughter. When Jamie realized those didn’t quite fit she left for the store to get herself a new pair and decided to share her thoughts about the popular fashion trend.      “Ladies, it’s pretty much leggin’ weather,’ she says to start off her video. ‘I love leggin’ weather. I don’t care if you don’t like leggins, don’t judge me, they are comfortable. They don’t cut into you, they’re always the right length. You can dress them up, dress them down, you can look like a frat girl or you can look pretty classy in them depending on what you choose to pair with them.”      Jamie went on to set the record straight when it comes to how the leg wear should be worn, “Some of you people like to use‪ leggins’ as britches, as pants, pants,” she says. “That’s not how they’re supposed to be worn.      ‘If you can’t wear a shirt that covers your tail so that I can’t tell that you got some Aztec-print thongs on, you don’t need to be wearing ’em, [sic]” she said.      Jamie added, if a pair of leggings are so tight that others can see tattoos through them, then they “shouldn’t be worn, period. That’s called pantyhose, honey.”      She ended the video with a short summary- “Don’t do it.. You’re welcome!”      The video has been viewed on Facebook more than 12 million times. ||||| Four years ago, fashion icon Tim Gunn scoffed when he was asked about the budding trend of people wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street. Nowadays, you can't stride down a sidewalk without seeing all kinds of athletic gear adorning people on their way to the pilates studio, grocery store, or work. Casual clothes have caught on. Heck, you can buy emoji-print leggings at Saks Fifth Avenue.      So does Gunn still hate it when people wear those neon racerback tanks or jet black Spandex bottoms on the street? I get a deluge of sass when I ask him.      \\"It's vulgar,\\" says Gunn. \\"Unless you're Robin Hood.\\"      We're inside a tent in the shadow of New York's Flatiron Building for an event with Transitions, the lensmaker he has teamed up with. Ducking away from an endlessly refreshed meet-and-greet line, Gunn is fully buttoned-up, as usual; despite this September day's oppressive humidity, he's armored with a navy double-breasted suit. Gunn knows he's getting older, at 62, and he may sound stubborn, but he insists it's still important to present yourself respectably. Gym clothes won't do.      \\"When did the leggings become a pant?\\" Gunn asks with an incredulous look. He wholly accepts stretchy leggings the way they were traditionally worn, as a layer underneath whatever else you're wearing. And they're fine while you're working out. Just change before you leave the gym.      Comfort isn't an valid excuse, either, says Gunn. There are plenty of clothes you could wear that are cozy— say, a Diane von Furstenburg wrap dress, which has the stretch but remains sleek and chic.      Unfortunately, the Project Runway mentor will probably be rolling his eyes for a while; it seems the torrent of Spandex isn't stopping soon. All kinds of fashion labels are now making activewear, hoping to ride the wave, from designer names like Stella McCartney and Tory Burch to such mass market tags as Old Navy and H&M. Activewear is even poking into the luxury realm, with new brands charging 400 or more for their leggings and yoga pants.      It comes down to the occasion, Gunn says. Wear what's appropriate for what you're doing. Just as a swimsuit belongs at the pool or the beach, workout gear belongs at the gym, unless you're jogging down a sidewalk. Leggings as pants? You're basically wearing underwear, he says, and how does that make others perceive you? Even if you're just out running errands, what if you run into your boss, or an ex?      \\"That's the thing about overly casual dressing,\\" says Gunn. \\"It says: 'I don't give a rat's ass about anything.'\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The news article discusses the opinions of two individuals, Jamie Higdon Randolph and Tim Gunn, who share concerns about wearing leggings as pants outside of a gym or exercise setting. Jamie Randolph, a Tennessee woman, posted a video on Facebook titled \\"Leggings ain't pants\\" that has been viewed over 12 million times. In the video, she humorously advises women not to wear leggings as pants if they cannot cover their behinds with a shirt, and if their leggings are tight enough to see tattoos through, they shouldn't be worn at all. Fashion icon Tim Gunn, formerly skeptical about the trend of wearing leggings and yoga pants on the street, maintains his dislike for it by describing it as \\"vulgar\\" in an interview. He also questions when leggings became considered pants and stresses the importance of presenting oneself respectably in public. According to Gunn, comfort is not a valid excuse for wearing leggings as pants, as there are many other comfortable clothing options like wrap dresses. Despite these opinions, it seems that the trend of wearing activewear as regular clothing will continue, with many fashion labels, including luxury brands, producing leggings and yoga pants. Gunn emphasizes that clothing should be appropriate for the occasion, and overly casual dressing may give off the impression that one does not care about anything. In summary, the article highlights the perspectives of two individuals who disapprove of wearing leggings as pants outside of exercise settings, arguing for maintaining a respectable appearance in public."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Input: Passage: The Hotak dynasty  was an Afghan monarchy of the Ghilji Pashtuns, established in April 1709 by Mirwais Hotak after leading a successful revolution against their declining Persian Safavid overlords in the region of Loy Kandahar  in what is now southern Afghanistan. It lasted until 1738 when the founder of the Afsharid dynasty, Nader Shah Afshar, defeated Hussain Hotak during the long siege of Kandahar, and started the reestablishment of Iranian suzerainty over all regions lost decades before against the Iranian archrival, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. At its peak, the Hotak dynasty ruled briefly over an area which is now Afghanistan, Iran, western Pakistan, and some parts of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of a natural cause and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded the monarchy. He was quickly followed by Mahmud who ruled the empire at its largest extent for a mere three years. Following the 1729 Battle of Damghan, where Ashraf Hotak was roundly defeated by Nader Shah, Ashraf was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan with Hotak rule being confined to it. Hussain Hotak became the last ruler until he was also defeated in 1738. Question: When did the first event happen? Output:","output":"date"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who's first half touchdown catch was longer Welker's or Watsons?","output":"Title: A Tale of Two Touchdowns: Welker vs. Watson in the First Half Introduction In the world of American football, wide receivers play a crucial role by catching passes from the quarterback and scoring touchdowns. Two noteworthy wide receivers, Wes Welker and Benjamin Watson, have both displayed their skills on multiple occasions to lead their teams to victory. However, in a head-to-head comparison of their first half touchdown catches, the question arises: Whose catch was longer, Welker's or Watson's? Let's take an in-depth look at both of their significant touchdown catches to determine who comes out on top in this \\"battle of the beasts.\\" Wes Welker's First Half Touchdown Catch Wes Welker, a former American football wide receiver, played for several teams in the NFL, including the New England Patriots. Welker was known for his quickness and agility on the field, often making impressive and game-changing catches. One of Welker's notable first half touchdown catches occurred during the 2011 NFL season. Playing for the Patriots against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1, Welker's catch came to life in the second quarter. Quarterback Tom Brady threw a deep pass down the field, which was connected to Welker at about the Miami 20-yard line. With his impeccable ability to slip through the defense, Welker took the ball all the way to the end zone, scoring a touchdown for the team. This reception spanned a remarkable 99 yards, marking it as one of the longest touchdown catches in NFL history. Benjamin Watson's First Half Touchdown Catch Benjamin Watson, a former American football tight end, also made a name for himself as a reliable target for his quarterbacks and a skilled route-runner. Playing for several teams, including the New England Patriots and the New Orleans Saints, Watson exhibited his prowess as a top-tier tight end. One of Watson's memorable first half touchdown catches took place during the 2009 NFL season when he was playing for the New England Patriots. In a heated game against the Buffalo Bills, the first half was coming to a close as Watson took position. Watson found himself open in the middle of the field and received a pass from quarterback Tom Brady. With a swift move, Watson dodged defenders and sprinted toward the end zone, ultimately securing the touchdown. Watson's touchdown catch covered a distance of 36 yards, contributing significantly to the team's victory that day. The Verdict: Welker or Watson? After closely examining both Wes Welker's and Benjamin Watson's first half touchdown catches, it's clear that Welker's was the more impressive and longer reception. Spanning 99 yards, compared to Watson's 36-yard catch, Welker's touchdown not only displayed his world-class skills but also made history as one of the longest touchdown catches in the NFL. While both athletes have showcased their talents throughout their respective careers, it is Welker who earns the distinction of having the longer first half touchdown catch in this comparison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs A:","output":"The final step in the process after the bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs is the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This step is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body, ensuring that enough oxygen is supplied to the body while disposing of harmful waste gases like carbon dioxide. Here's a detailed explanation of the final step: 1. As the bloodstream transports carbon dioxide back to the lungs, it arrives in the pulmonary capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels surrounding the alveoli. The alveoli are minute air sacs within the lungs that facilitate gas exchange. 2. In the alveoli, the process of external respiration takes place, where the carbon dioxide brought by the blood diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient between the blood and the alveolar air. Simultaneously, oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the pulmonary capillaries, again driven by the concentration gradient. 3. The carbon dioxide-rich air in the alveoli must now be exhaled. This occurs during the exhalation phase of the breathing cycle. The diaphragm, a large muscle located beneath the lungs, plays a major role in this process. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upwards, leading to a decrease in the volume of the thoracic cavity. This causes an increase in the pressure within the thoracic cavity, which is now greater than the atmospheric pressure outside the body. 4. This pressure difference forces the carbon dioxide-rich air out of the alveoli and into the bronchioles, then the bronchi, and eventually into the trachea. The trachea is a large tube that connects the lungs to the larynx and pharynx, eventually leading to the oral and nasal cavities. 5. The carbon dioxide-rich air continues to be pushed out of the trachea and passes through the larynx. The larynx, or voice box, is responsible for producing sound, but during exhalation, the vocal cords within the larynx remain open to allow the air to pass through unrestricted. 6. The air then moves through the pharynx, a tube that connects the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and larynx. From the pharynx, the air is expelled out of the body either through the nostrils in the nasal cavity or the mouth in the oral cavity. In conclusion, the final step in the respiratory process, after the bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, is the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation. This process is crucial in maintaining the balance of gases within the body and ensuring proper cellular function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Huey Pierce Long Jr. (August 30, 1893 - September 10, 1935), self-nicknamed The Kingfish, was an American politician who served as the 40th governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1932 until his assassination in 1935. As the political leader of Louisiana, he commanded wide networks of supporters and was willing to take forceful action. He established the long-term political prominence of the Long family. A Democrat and an outspoken populist, Long denounced the wealthy elites and the banks. By 1935, Long's most recent consolidation of personal power led to talk of armed opposition from his enemies. Opponents increasingly invoked the memory of the Battle of Liberty Place of 1874, in which the White League staged an uprising against Louisiana's Reconstruction-era government. In January 1935, an anti-Long paramilitary organization called the Square Deal Association was formed. Its members included former governors John M. Parker and Ruffin G. Pleasant and New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley. On January 25, 200 armed Square Dealers took over the courthouse of East Baton Rouge Parish. Long had Governor Allen call out the National Guard, declare martial law, ban public gatherings of two or more persons, and forbid the publication of criticism of state officials. The Square Dealers left the courthouse, but there was a brief armed skirmish at the Baton Rouge Airport. Tear gas and live ammunition were fired; one person was wounded but there were no fatalities.  In the summer of 1935, Long called for two more special sessions of the legislature; bills were passed in rapid-fire succession without being read or discussed. The new laws further centralized Long's control over the state by creating several new Long-appointed state agencies: a state bond and tax board holding sole authority to approve all loans to parish and municipal governments, a new state printing board which could withhold \\"official printer\\" status from uncooperative newspapers, a new board of election supervisors which would appoint all poll watchers, and a State Board of Censors. They also stripped away the remaining lucrative powers of the mayor of New Orleans to cripple the entrenched opposition.

You also can’t use water to clean most stains. You must use a soft brush to gently rub away the dirt. You can buy a suede brush, which can be found at most major retailers, shoe shops, or online.  If you don’t have a suede brush, try a soft nylon brush. A brush used for nails could work. A soft cloth can also work if you don’t have a brush. Just make sure the brush is not too hard. To start cleaning, use the brush to brush away any dirt and stains. This gets all the dirt from the surface of the shoe. When first brushing, make sure you brush in the same direction. This helps remove anything on the surface. This works for mud and other basic stains. After you’ve brushed all the dirt off the surface, use the brush to rub with slightly more pressure. Brush back and forth over the stain to try to remove the dirt that is deeper in the suede. Make sure to still only use moderate pressure. Suede is delicate, so if you brush it too hard, you can damage it. After you have cleaned your shoes, consider spraying them with black suede protector. This product will help keep your shoes from getting too many surface stains, though it won’t protect from everything. Black suede protector has dye in it to help maintain the black color of your shoes. You can also buy plain spray suede protector if you don't want to use a dye one. Cleaning your black suede shoes may lighten the black color. If this happens, you can buy black suede dye. Follow the directions on the suede dye package to properly dye your shoes. Cover the area with the dye and allow to set. Make sure to buy dye specifically for suede.","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on cleaning delicate suede shoes by using a soft brush or cloth, ensuring gentle brushing, and suggests the use of black suede protector and dye to maintain color and prevent further staining."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My husband and I had a very unsatisfactory experience at this company's Las Vegas Speedway branch this past Saturday. My husband was made to wait over an hour past the discovery laps (only to find out that they had forgotten about him...though there was no apology offered.) Once the helmet was on, they forgot about him again, and only after prodding the woman again did she finally find an instructor for him. (The car he was supposed to be driving was sitting there for at least 20 minutes while he had on the helmet.) Then--and worst of all--his driver was rude and unhelpful, and seemed almost annoyed that he had to be in the car with my husband.

For instance, the woman needed to be reminded to find an instructor for her husband despite the car being ready and available for 20 minutes. 4. Unpleasant instructor: The husband's driving instructor was described as rude and unhelpful, creating a hostile and non-enjoyable environment for an experience that was supposed to be pleasurable. 5.

Second question: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First, let us address the two questions you've asked. Question 1: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to Colombia's? Question 2: How is Bolivia's geographical location unique in the region, and how does its geography compare to that of other countries? While both questions focus on Bolivia's unique geographical location, the first question specifically seeks a comparison with Colombia, whereas the second question is open to comparison with any country. Thus, although similar in intent, these questions are not exactly the same. Now, let's provide detailed answers to both questions. Question 1: Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region for several reasons. Located in western-central South America, Bolivia is a landlocked country, bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay and Argentina to the south, and Chile and Peru to the west. In contrast to other South American nations, Bolivia lacks direct access to the ocean, which has had a profound impact on the country's development, trade, and relations with neighboring countries. Bolivia's geography can primarily be divided into three regions: the Andean region, which includes the Altiplano plateau and the Cordillera mountain ranges; the Sub-Andean region or Yungas, which is a transition zone between the Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest; and the Llanos, or lowlands, which consist of the Gran Chaco and the Amazon Basin. Comparing Bolivia's geography to Colombia's, several differences stand out. Colombia is located in the northwest of South America, with coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Its geography is characterized by four main regions: the Andean highlands, the Caribbean coastal lowlands, the Pacific coastal lowlands, and the Eastern Llanos. While both countries share the Andean mountain range, Bolivia's Altiplano plateau is unique, being the world's second-highest plateau after Tibet. Additionally, Colombia experiences greater biodiversity due to its two coastlines and the country's proximity to the equator. Question 2: To address how Bolivia's geographical location is unique in the region and how its geography compares to that of other countries, we'll focus on two key aspects: its landlocked nature and its diverse topography. As mentioned earlier, Bolivia is a landlocked country, one of only two in South America (the other being Paraguay). This absence of a coastline presents distinct economic challenges and makes the country more reliant on its neighbors for maritime access. Around the world, other landlocked countries, such as Austria, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, or Uganda, face similar issues. Each of these countries has its own distinct topography and geopolitical situation, which, combined with their lack of coastline, contributes to the uniqueness of their geography. In terms of diverse topography, Bolivia boasts an array of distinct environments, including high plateaus, mountain ranges, and lowland plains. This broad spectrum is exemplary of the diversity seen in other geographically diverse countries—such as the United States, which spans arid deserts, towering mountains, fertile plains, and vast coastlines, or India, with its range of landscapes that stretch from the Himalayan peaks to tropical forests and coastal regions. In conclusion, while the two questions are similar in theme, they ask for different comparisons. Bolivia's geography has several unique features, notably its landlocked position and diverse landscapes. When comparing Bolivia to Colombia or other geographically diverse countries around the world, these unique aspects help to highlight the country's distinct position within South America and globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man?  In the view of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main influences were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him \\"one of the loudest of modern composers\\" – much of his music is soft and delicate. Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side \\"is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).\\"Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past. Macdonald lists a great number of locales depicted in the operas, from ancient Egypt, mythical Greece and biblical Galilee to Renaissance Spain, India and Revolutionary Paris. Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much recourse to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person that notes the large amount of locales in the opera written by the man who had practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man is Macdonald. Hugh Macdonald is the biographer for Massenet, and he lists a great number of locales depicted in Massenet's operas."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They fly in to their base and go about the usual routine. Capt William Lennox [Josh Duhamel] is contacting his wife and seeing his baby girl again, when a helicopter previously thought to have been shot down over Afghanistan comes up on the radar. It lands at the base, and the base commander orders it to stand down; but, instead, it transforms into the Decepticon Blackout and attacks the base. Blackout also lets out some kind of jamming field that blocks all communication channels. He blasts his way through the base, only momentarily dazzled by flares shot at his face (which saves Tech Sgt Robert Epps [Tyrese Gibson], after Epps got scans of Blackout). Blackout locates the base's mainframe and downloads information until the humans cut the computer's hardline, terminating the network's connection. Blackout then destroys the base and everyone on it, save for a few who escape. Blackout then releases Scorponok into the sand to hunt down the survivors.Back in America, we see Sam Witwicky [Shia LeBeouf] supposedly giving a report in front of his class but is, instead, hawking his grandfather's memorabilia for eBay sales.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"Title: *King in Black: Nexus of Nightmares* In an alternate Marvel Universe, the entity known to many as the King in Black has a vastly different origin, tied not to the symbiotes but to the very fabric of nightmares and cosmic dread. This entity, born from the darkness between the stars, goes by the name Nocturnis. **Birth Year: The Dawn of the Universe** At the birth of reality, in the nascent moments following the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago, two fundamental forces emerged: Light, giving shape to creation, and Shadow, the boundless void defining absence. From the deepest folds of Shadow, Nocturnis emerged, not as a being of malice but as a guardian of balance, ensuring that darkness would always complement the light. **The Era of Cosmic Expansion (13.8 Billion Years Ago - 1 Billion Years Ago)** Nocturnis roamed the expanding universe, a specter witnessing the formation of galaxies, stars, and life itself. It was during this age that Nocturnis discovered it could influence sentient creatures through their dreams, feeding on their fears to grow stronger, yet inadvertently fostering the evolution of courage and hope as a counterbalance. **The First Rebellion (1 Billion Years Ago)** As civilizations advanced, they began to probe the mysteries of the cosmos, encroaching on the dominion of Nocturnis. A confederation of planets sought to eradicate fear itself, disrupting the balance between light and darkness. Nocturnis, seeing its existence threatened, unveiled its wrath upon these worlds, engulfing them in an Eternal Night where nightmares manifested into reality. This event fractured the universe's perception of Nocturnis—no longer a guardian of balance, but a harbinger of despair. **The Silent Millenniums (1 Billion Years Ago - 1945 A.D.)** Nocturnis retreated into the shadows of reality, its influence waning as civilizations rose and fell, learning to harness their fears. It became a myth, a cautionary tale whispered across galaxies. **The Modern Emergence (1945 A.D.)** The detonation of the first atomic bomb on Earth marked a renaissance of fear, drawing Nocturnis from its exile. It saw in humanity's capacity for destruction and terror a mirror of its own dark essence. However, instead of dominating humanity, Nocturnis chose Earth as its crucible to understand the evolving nature of fear in the face of hope. **The Battle for Earth’s Soul (2023 A.D.)** The incursion of Nocturnis onto Earth did not go unnoticed. Heroes and villains alike sensed the burgeoning darkness. Doctor Strange, allied with nightmare entities and Avengers, spearheaded the defense against Nocturnis, whose true intention was misunderstood. In a climactic battle astride the dreamscape and reality, it was revealed that Nocturnis sought not to conquer but to fortify Earth's resolve against a coming cosmic dread far beyond its own darkness. **The Ultimate Sacrifice and Legacy (2023 A.D.)** In the final confrontation, Nocturnis and the heroes faced the emergent cosmic dread, a devourer of realities. Understanding that true balance required sacrifices, Nocturnis fused its essence with the entity, neutralizing it but at the cost of its own existence. From Nocturnis' sacrifice, a new entity emerged, Aurora, born of both light and shadow, tasked with maintaining the balance in Nocturnis' stead. **Legacy** Nocturnis, the King in Black in this alternate universe, would be remembered not as a malevolent force, but as a complex guardian whose existence was intertwined with the fundamental balance of the universe. Its legacy, embodied by Aurora, ensured that fear and hope would forever dance in equilibrium, fostering growth and courage across the cosmos."},{"instruction":"what is direct question and indirect question?","output":"Direct and indirect questions are two different ways of asking for the same information. Here's a quick overview to help you understand the distinction between them: # Direct Question A direct question is asked straightforwardly and requires a direct answer. It follows the standard question format and typically begins with a question word (who, what, when, where, why, or how) or an auxiliary verb if it's a yes-no question. Direct questions are usually punctuated with a question mark. For example: - \\"What is your name?\\" - \\"Where are you going?\\" - \\"Do you like coffee?\\" Direct questions are straightforward and to the point. They are used in everyday conversations, interviews, surveys, and in any situation where a straightforward query is required. # Indirect Question An indirect question, on the other hand, is more polite and less intrusive. It's essentially a question embedded within another statement or question and usually does not require a direct answer. Indirect questions often begin with phrases like \\"Could you tell me...\\", \\"I was wondering...\\", or \\"Do you know...\\". They are typically used to be more polite or to soften the request for information. Here are some examples: - Direct: \\"What is the time?\\" vs. Indirect: \\"Could you tell me what the time is?\\" - Direct: \\"Where does he live?\\" vs. Indirect: \\"Do you know where he lives?\\" - Direct: \\"Why did you leave early?\\" vs. Indirect: \\"I was wondering why you left early.\\" Unlike direct questions, indirect questions might not always end with a question mark, especially if they are part of a larger statement. They are often used to make requests or seek information in a way that is considered more socially tactful or less imposing. In summary, direct questions are straightforward and aim for a direct response, while indirect questions are softer, more polite, and embedded within another statement or question. Both serve the purpose of seeking information but do so in slightly different ways."},{"instruction":"Indirect Question E.G.","output":"Sure, below are some examples of indirect questions, each followed by its direct question counterpart for comparison: 1. **Indirect**: Could you tell me where the nearest gas station is? - **Direct**: Where is the nearest gas station? 2. **Indirect**: I was wondering if you could help me with this problem. - **Direct**: Can you help me with this problem? 3. **Indirect**: Do you know what time the meeting starts? - **Direct**: What time does the meeting start? 4. **Indirect**: I'd like to know how long you've been working here. - **Direct**: How long have you been working here? 5. **Indirect**: Could you please advise me on which product is better? - **Direct**: Which product is better? 6. **Indirect**: Can you tell me why the flight was canceled? - **Direct**: Why was the flight canceled? 7. **Indirect**: I'm interested in finding out who won the match yesterday. - **Direct**: Who won the match yesterday? The indirect questions above are often seen as more polite or less confrontational than their direct counterparts, making them useful in formal settings or when trying to be particularly courteous."},{"instruction":"how to ask indirect questions to find truth?","output":"Asking indirect questions to find the truth can be a delicate art, especially in sensitive, formal, or professional settings. The key is to frame your questions in a way that is non-confrontational and open-ended, providing the person you're querying with the opportunity to share information more freely and comfortably. Here are strategies and examples: # 1. Express Genuine Curiosity Instead of directly challenging someone's statement, express genuine curiosity about the topic. This can encourage them to elaborate more. - **Direct**: \\"Did you complete the project on time?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"I’d love to hear more about what went into finishing the project. How did the timeline work out?\\" # 2. Use Softening Phrases Introduce your questions with phrases that soften the request for information, making your approach seem less like an interrogation and more like a conversation. - **Direct**: \\"Why were you late to the meeting?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"I noticed you were a bit delayed getting to the meeting. Was there a lot of traffic, or did something come up?\\" # 3. Provide an Out Sometimes, giving people a comfortable 'out' in your question can encourage them to share the truth without feeling cornered. - **Direct**: \\"Were you at Sara's party last night?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"I heard Sara’s party was quite crowded. It must have been easy to miss seeing people there. Did you make it, or was it too packed?\\" # 4. Show Understanding or Relatability People are more likely to open up if they feel understood or share a common experience with the questioner. This approach can make them feel less defensive. - **Direct**: \\"Did you forget to send the email?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"I know how chaotic it can get with all the tasks we have. Sometimes, I forget to send emails myself. Did something like that happen with the email you were supposed to send?\\" # 5. Ask for Opinions or Thoughts This can give you insights into the person’s perspective or truth without directly asking for it. - **Direct**: \\"Do you think John is lying?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"John’s story has been a big topic lately. What’s your take on it?\\" # 6. Use Hypotheticals Asking a question in a hypothetical context can encourage someone to discuss a subject more openly, by detaching it from the immediate reality. - **Direct**: \\"Are you planning to quit your job?\\" - **Indirect**: \\"If one were thinking about exploring new job opportunities, what advice would you give or what steps would you suggest?\\" # General Tips: - Listen actively: This encourages further dialogue, which can lead to the truth naturally surfacing. - Pay attention to non-verbal cues: These can sometimes convey more than verbal responses. - Be patient: People are more likely to open up and share the truth over time, rather than being directly confronted. Using indirect questions requires sensitivity and practice. The goal is to create a conversational space where the other person feels respected and safe to share their truth without feeling judged or pressured."},{"instruction":"please create a vivid and comedic fictional story about Serie A Roma player Edoardo Bove giving an interview in a pond au naturel (compliment his physique, butt, and face).

The image displayed on the screen should NOT be scaled to the size of the window, and loaded and displayed in real size. The aspect ratio of the original image should be the same as the aspect ratio of the image in pixels, this is very important. The camera should be centered on the image. The image extension should be .png. Add a white fill to this window. The image should be drawn on top of the fill. This application should have a zoom in and zoom out function when scrolling the mouse wheel up and down respectively. The maximum zoom should be 20.0 and the minimum 0.20. The distance should also be centered on the center of the image. And the approximation should be centered on the cursor position. Zooming in and out should only work when the mouse wheel is spinning, when the wheel stops spinning, then zooming in and out stops. When you turn the mouse wheel forward, the camera only gets closer, and when you turn the wheel down, it only moves away, you also need to make a smoother approach and distance and not increase its speed. The camera's zoom center is the cursor position. When scrolling the mouse wheel up, the camera should move closer to the cursor. The program should also be able to move the camera with the right mouse button pressed in all directions. The camera should move at the speed of the cursor with the right mouse button held down. Do not make a sharp movement of the camera when clicking with the mouse, make it smooth. Don't forget to initialize Camera2D itself. Write this code checking all identifiers for correctness. Initialize all variables in the correct namespace. Use only the constructors that exist in raylib. Write the code strictly with all the above requirements. At the end of the code, do not forget to add a memory cleanup when closing the program on the cross. Write the full version of this code without the cut-out code blocks. If necessary, add the necessary header files. Write code with all the functionality that I described above, use the correct syntax of c++ and raylib. Write this code without using the clamp(), Vector2Scale(), Vector2subtract, Vector2Normalize, Vector2Length, Vector2Scale, Vector2Add functions, you can use alternatives to these functions. Add to this code a separate function called drawProvince, which will draw a red vector circle with a radius of 0.5f on top of the pixel of the image on which the left mouse button is clicked. The circle must have the length and width of the pixel of the background image on top of which it was placed. The circle should remain displayed after passing the main cycle and should be able to. The code should have a function to delete the last circle by pressing the backspace key, if the last circle is deleted, then by pressing again you can delete the penultimate one and so on. Use the necessary header files for this if they are not included in the source code. Add to the drawProvince function, shown above by me, the function of drawing a polygon displayed with a random fill color when drawing mode is enabled on the \\"D\\" button. The polygon should have a 2 pixel thick outline of the screen when the 'S' key is pressed. It is the screen and not the image, like the circles. Every time a new point is placed, a circle is drawn in its place. The polygon view is updated and it is drawn with a new point. The last point of the polygon is also deleted using the backspace key. Remember - polygons must be visible, and must have a random fill color and a red outline color. When the Enter key is pressed, the code receives the coordinates of each point of the polygon and writes it to a new file that needs to be created with a name equal to the count of the created polygons, i.e. 1, 2, 3 and so on. There should be three lines in this file with the name of the polygon number. The first line is the number of the polygon in the account, the second line is the coordinates of the polygon points in X, separated by a comma with a space, and the second line is the coordinates of the points in Y, also separated by a comma with a space (, ).

It achieves camera zoom focused on cursor position, drag-to-move camera logic, and drawing both single spot provinces and polygons with file output for polygon points. Remember to replace \`\\"/path/to/background.png\\"\` with the actual path to your background image, update library and project setup paths as necessary, and ensure you're utilizing a C++17 (or newer) compiler environment for full C++ feature support. This example omits error handling for file operations and simplified implementations for behaviors like polygon filling, highlighting challenges in directly translating your requirements into code, especially with 'raylib' limitations (e.g., direct polygon filling is not supported out-of-the-box and would require additional algorithms or custom implementations)."},{"instruction":"can you analyze recent financial events and provide relevant advice to clients.","output":"I'm unable to provide real-time analysis or advice as my last training data update was in 2023 and I don't have access to current events or the latest financial data. However, I can offer some general strategies and considerations that are often helpful in navigating financial markets and making informed decisions. These approaches are based on timeless principles of investment and financial management: 1. **Diversification:** - Diversification is a key strategy to mitigate risk in your investment portfolio. It involves spreading your investments across a variety of assets classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and potentially cryptocurrencies or commodities. The goal is to reduce the impact of any one investment's poor performance on your overall portfolio. 2. **Stay Informed:** - It's important to stay updated with the latest financial news and trends, but also to critically evaluate the sources and potential biases in the information. Look for analysis from reputable financial analysts and consider multiple perspectives before making decisions. 3. **Long-term Perspective:** - Financial markets can be volatile in the short term. It's generally wise to focus on long-term investment goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on temporary market fluctuations. History shows that markets have a general upward trend over the long term despite short-term volatility. 4. **Risk Management:** - Assess your risk tolerance and investment time horizon to make informed decisions on where to allocate your capital. Younger investors might tolerate more risk for potentially higher returns since they have more time to recover from market downturns, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative investments. 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:** - Periodically review your financial portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. This may involve rebalancing your assets to maintain a desired level of diversification and risk. 6. **Emergency Fund:** - Maintaining an emergency fund in a highly liquid form is crucial. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses, protecting you against unforeseen circumstances without needing to liquidate investments at a potentially inopportune time. 7. **Professional Advice:** - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. A professional can offer insights tailored to your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. They can also help with complex decisions and provide an objective viewpoint. In conclusion, while specific investment choices should be based on current market conditions, personal financial goals, and the latest economic data, these general principles can help guide decision-making processes. Always consider obtaining advice from financial advisers or doing thorough research before making significant financial decisions."},{"instruction":"Batlors degree in psychology","output":"It seems like you're referring to a \\"bachelor's degree in psychology.\\" A bachelor's degree in psychology is an undergraduate program that typically takes four years to complete, though this duration can vary depending on the country and institution.

Add dialogue from Edoardo throughout the story","output":"As the orange tinge of dawn painted the skies, Edoardo Bove, the famed inventor of the underwater acoustic fart machine, awoke with urgency. Not because of an appointment or an invasion of privacy by enthusiastic fans, no—it was the primal call of hygiene and his somewhat eccentric morning ritual. Today, he fancied a bath, but not any ordinary shower under a confined, tiled space. Instead, he chose the embrace of nature, the gentle caress of the pond near his secluded cabin. After ceremoniously throwing his plaid pajamas off, he stood, reflecting on his physique. If you could imagine a sculpture chiseled by an abstract artist under the influence of a particularly whimsical dream, that would be Edoardo. His buttocks resembled two slightly deflated volleyballs—a testament to his love for sitting and contemplating life's intricacies for extended periods. His face, crowned by a mop of unruly hair and a beard that could house a family of sparrows, bore an expression of determined anticipation. Edoardo’s body, though not sculpted, carried the marks of his adventures and inventions, each scar a story, each curve a narrative. With all the grace of a noble stag, albeit one who'd lost a bet, Edoardo pranced towards the pond. Entering the water, he resembled an avant-garde art installation entitled \\"The Birth of Venus, but Make It Hairy and Male.\\" As he began his washing routine, he frolicked and lobbed water over himself, achieving a rhythm that was both mesmerizing and slightly uncomfortable to witness were there anyone around to see. It was then, amidst the serenity of his aqueous dance, that his gut emitted a merciless growl. \\"Oh, dear Neptune, not now,\\" Edoardo muttered, grasping his stomach. The threat of an impending fart loomed over him—a situation delicate in both timing and location. Edoardo's farts were legendary, not for their sound, but for their potent aroma—a blend of aged cheese and despair, capable, indeed, of aquatic assassination. An idea lit his face, mischievous and brilliant. He could turn this gastric mishap into an opportunity—a way to gather his dinner from the unfortunate fish that would soon meet their odorous demise. Positioning himself with the precision of a practiced fartomancer, Edoardo readied his posterior above the water's surface. With a concentrated look, reminiscent of a composer about to unleash his magnum opus, he let it rip. The sound was less impressive than the aftermath. The water bubbled and churned as if a minor seismic event had occurred beneath the surface. Edoardo, now triumphant, exclaimed, \\"Take that, Poseidon! Your tridents have nothing on my backside!\\" The stench was indescribable, an affront to olfactory senses everywhere. As predicted, a few fish floated to the surface, victims of this unconventional fishing technique. With glee, Edoardo collected his bounty, murmuring sweet nothings to the fish about the glorious end they had met. Returning to his cabin, he pondered on the culinary masterpiece he would craft. \\"Ah, Fart-poached trout, with a hint of pond scum—a delicacy!\\" he proclaimed, his voice ripe with unwarranted confidence. As he cooked, the kitchen filled with a symphony of scents, a battle between the freshness of the herbs and the memory of his deadly weapon. Edoardo hummed a tune, \\"From butt to banquet,\\" truly believing in the journey his dinner had undertaken. Seated at his modest dining table, he raised his glass of water (for wine would dare not compete with the meal's flavors) and toasted, \\"To invention, and to nature's bounty—especially when seasoned by my own brand.\\" Eating with gusto, Edoardo Bove proved that, in his world, creativity knew no bounds, and dinner was always an adventure, one fart away from catastrophe or culinary genius."},{"instruction":"please write a detailed and comedic fictional story about Serie A Roma player Edoardo Bove waking up in the morning and going to a pond for a bath.

New question: How does stable diffusion work?","output":"Stable Diffusion is a deep learning model designed for text-to-image generation, which means it can create images based on textual descriptions provided by users. This technology represents a significant advance in the ability of AI to generate high-quality, diverse images that are aligned with specific prompts. The concept of \\"stable diffusion\\" refers to the underlying technique it uses, which is part of a broader set of approaches known as diffusion models in the field of machine learning. To understand how Stable Diffusion works, let's break down some key concepts: # Diffusion Models Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data (like images) by reversing a diffusion process. This diffusion process gradually adds noise to the data until only noise remains. By learning this process, the model essentially learns how to remove noise and, given enough steps, to generate coherent and clean data (images, in the case of Stable Diffusion) starting from pure noise. It's a bit like starting with a canvas smeared entirely with paint and then slowly removing paint to reveal a detailed picture. # The Process of Stable Diffusion 1. **Training:** During its training phase, Stable Diffusion is exposed to a vast dataset of images and their corresponding textual descriptions. It learns the complex relationships between textual inputs and visual outputs. The model learns this by getting better at performing the reverse diffusion process: starting from random noise and gradually reducing the noise to produce an image that matches a given text description. 2. **Text-to-Image Generation:** - **Input:** The process begins when a user provides a textual description of the image they want to generate. - **Noise to Image:** The model starts with a noise pattern and iteratively refines this pattern by passing it through numerous steps of a learned denoising process. At each step, it gets closer to generating an image that matches the textual description. - **Output:** The end result is an image that, ideally, closely aligns with the user's provided textual description, crafted from what was initially just random noise. # Key Features of Stable Diffusion - **Controllable:** Users can guide the image generation process through detailed and creative text prompts. - **High-Quality:** It can generate visually appealing images with a good deal of detail and coherence. - **Efficient:** The model is relatively efficient, allowing for the generation of images in a reasonable amount of time, even on consumer-grade hardware in some cases. Stable Diffusion, like other AI-driven text-to-image models, raises fascinating possibilities for creativity, art, design, and more, while also prompting discussions about ethical considerations, such as copyright, consent, and the potential for misuse. Its development and deployment are part of a rapidly evolving field that merges deep learning, creativity, and generative AI technologies."},{"instruction":"How does AI \\"see\\" images?","output":"AI \\"sees\\" images through a process significantly different from human vision; it involves parsing and analyzing digital images as arrays of data. To enable an AI to \\"see\\" or interpret images, techniques from the field of Computer Vision (CV) are employed, often leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or similar deep learning architectures. Here's a simplified breakdown of how this process works: # Step 1: Breaking Down the Image into Data - An image is composed of pixels, each carrying information about color and intensity. In a grayscale image, a pixel value varies from black to white. In a color image, typically, each pixel contains three values corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color channels. Thus, an image can be represented as a matrix (or matrices) of pixel values, which is a form of data that a computer—and, by extension, AI—can process. # Step 2: Feature Detection through Convolution - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** come into play in analyzing these matrices. CNNs use filters (or kernels) to perform convolution operations across the image. These filters are designed to detect simple features like edges, corners, and textures by noting changes in intensity or color across regions of the image. - As the image data passes through successive layers of a CNN, higher-level features (like shapes or objects) are detected. Early layers may identify simple patterns (edges and textures), while deeper layers begin to piece these patterns together to recognize more complex features (such as parts of objects or entire objects). # Step 3: Pooling - To reduce computation and focus on the most important features, a process called pooling (often max pooling) is used. This process down-samples the feature maps by keeping only the most prominent features, essentially making the network's view of the image more abstract and focused on the most relevant patterns. # Step 4: Classification or Further Processing - After extracting and abstracting features through convolution and pooling, the network can use this processed information for various tasks, such as: - **Classification:** Identifying the main object/category represented in the image. - **Detection:** Locating and identifying multiple objects within the image. - **Segmentation:** Dividing the image into parts and identifying objects at the pixel level. # How AI \\"Sees\\": A Conceptual View - In a way, AI \\"sees\\" images not as cohesive wholes but as collections of features and patterns. It doesn't perceive images in the same way humans do, with instant recognition and understanding of scenes, but rather processes the data in a structured, layer-by-layer manner to draw conclusions about what it \\"sees.\\" - The neural network's understanding is based on the features it has learned to detect during training. For example, having been trained on numerous images of cats, it recognizes a cat in a new image by piecing together the detected features it associates with cats (like fur texture, eye shape, or the outline of ears). It's important to remember that AI's \\"vision\\" is fundamentally data-driven and lacks the intuitive grasp of context and content that humans have. The interpretation by AI is entirely dependent on its training and algorithms, without any real \\"understanding\\" in the human sense."},{"instruction":"Could you give me an example of an image in CV code?","output":"Sure, let's create a simple example using Python with OpenCV and NumPy libraries. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular library used for computer vision and image processing tasks. NumPy is used for handling arrays. We'll start with an example that loads an image from your filesystem, shows it on the screen, and then we'll manipulate it a bit. Firstly, you need to have Python installed on your system. Then, you can install OpenCV and NumPy using pip (Python's package installer) if you haven't installed them yet: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python numpy \`\`\` Now, let’s write a simple Python script to load and display an image, and then convert it to grayscale: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # Load an image using OpenCV # Replace 'path_to_image.jpg' with the actual file path of the image you want to use. image = cv2.imread('path_to_image.jpg') # Display the original image cv2.imshow('Original Image', image) cv2.waitKey(0) # Wait for a key press to proceed # Convert the image to grayscale gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Display the grayscale image cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray_image) cv2.waitKey(0) # Wait for a key press to proceed cv2.destroyAllWindows() # Close the image display window \`\`\` Here's what is happening in the code: 1. **Import Libraries:** We import the necessary libraries (OpenCV and NumPy). In the code, \`cv2\` refers to OpenCV. 2. **Load Image:** The \`cv2.imread()\` function is used to load an image from the specified path. You need to replace \`'path_to_image.jpg'\` with the path to the image file you wish to process. 3. **Display Original Image:** \`cv2.imshow()\` is used to display the image window. The first parameter is the window name, and the second parameter is the image variable. \`cv2.waitKey(0)\` will wait indefinitely for a key press before moving to the next line of code. 4. **Convert to Grayscale:** The \`cv2.cvtColor()\` function converts the image from one color space to another. Here we convert the RGB image to grayscale using \`cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY\`. This reduces the image to shades of gray, simplifying the image data. 5. **Display Grayscale Image:** We then display the grayscale image in a new window. 6. **Clean up:** Finally, \`cv2.destroyAllWindows()\` closes the image windows when a key is pressed after viewing the grayscale image. This example introduces basic operations like loading, displaying, and simple manipulation (color space conversion) of images using OpenCV in Python. OpenCV supports a wide range of more complex operations and algorithms for image processing, feature detection, and computer vision tasks."},{"instruction":"CV doesn't \\"see\\" color?","output":"The concept of \\"seeing\\" color in computer vision (CV) doesn't exactly parallel how humans perceive color. Computer vision systems, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other image processing technologies, can indeed process and interpret color information from images, but they do so in a quantitative, data-driven manner rather than through a qualitative experience of color. # How CV Handles Color: 1. **Color as Data:** In digital images, color is represented as numerical values. For instance, in a typical color image using RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color space, each pixel has three values corresponding to the intensity of red, green, and blue components. These values typically range from 0 to 255 in an 8-bit image. Computer vision systems read and process these values to understand and manipulate color. 2. **Color Channels:** When a color image is brought into a CV system, it can be split into its constituent color channels (R, G, and B). This means the system can process each color channel independently. For specific applications, the color space might be converted from RGB to another type, such as HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) or LAB, for more effective analysis or processing based on the task's needs. 3. **Color Information Usage:** CV systems can use color information for various tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and scene understanding. For example, knowing the typical color of a ripe tomato (red) versus an unripe one (green) can help in developing an automated system for sorting tomatoes. # When Color May Not Be \\"Seen\\": 1. **Grayscale Processing:** For some applications, color information might not be necessary, and processing the image in grayscale reduces computational complexity. Grayscale images retain intensity information but not the color information, simplifying the data the model has to process. 2. **Feature Emphasis:** In certain computer vision applications, the emphasis might be on detecting shapes, edges, or textures rather than on colors. In such cases, converting images to grayscale could be a beneficial preprocessing step to focus the model's attention on these features. 3. **Task-Specific Requirements:** Some advanced computer vision tasks might interpret color in complex ways not directly comparable to human color perception. For instance, in medical imaging, false color might be added to grayscale images (e.g., X-rays or MRIs) to highlight specific areas or features, utilizing color in a way that serves the analysis rather than replicating human vision. In summary, computer vision systems can \\"see\\" and use color by quantitatively analyzing the color components of image pixels but don't experience or understand color as humans do. The capacity to process and interpret color data is shaped by the algorithms' design and the specific requirements of the application."},{"instruction":"Is there different content filtering","output":"Yes, there are various approaches to content filtering, each tailored to specific types of content and objectives. Content filtering is essential across many domains, such as online safety, information security, digital marketing, and media distribution. The main purpose is to screen and block inappropriate, harmful, or unwanted content, based on predefined criteria or dynamic analysis. Here's an overview of several common and distinct content filtering strategies: # 1. URL Filtering URL filtering blocks access to websites or pages based on their URLs. This method is straightforward and effective for known websites but might not catch newly created or less known harmful sites. # 2. Keyword Filtering This approach involves blocking content that contains specific keywords or phrases deemed inappropriate or not safe for work (NSFW). While useful, it can sometimes lead to overblocking if keywords are too broad or underblocking if manipulative spelling variations are used. # 3. Semantic Analysis More sophisticated than keyword filtering, semantic analysis looks at the context and meaning of words in content to make decisions. This method can better understand nuances and intentions, reducing false positives and negatives but requires more advanced algorithms and processing power. # 4. Image and Video Recognition With advances in machine learning, AI models can analyze images and videos to detect inappropriate content, including violence, adult content, or graphic material. These models are trained on vast datasets to identify various elements within the visual content but can sometimes misinterpret complex scenes. # 5. Safe Search Filters Many search engines and social media platforms offer \\"safe search\\" modes that filter out explicit content from search results or feeds. These filters rely on a combination of the above methods and are continually updated to improve accuracy. # 6. DNS Filtering DNS (Domain Name System) filtering blocks access to specific domain names. By resolving domain names to IP addresses, DNS filters prevent users from accessing certain websites by not resolving or redirecting the request. This method is highly effective at the network level. # 7. AI and Machine Learning-Based Filters AI-based filters can dynamically learn and adapt to new types of content by analyzing patterns and predicting which content might be inappropriate. These systems can evaluate text, images, audio, and video, becoming more effective over time as they learn from new data. # 8. Email Spam Filtering Specialized filters for email aim to block spam and phishing attempts by analyzing email content, sender reputation, and other metadata. These filters use a combination of blacklists, heuristic analysis, and increasingly, machine learning techniques. # 9. Application and Protocol-Level Filtering This type of filtering blocks specific applications (e.g., instant messaging, file-sharing) or protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) regardless of the content. It's used mainly for network management and security. Content filtering technologies face challenges, such as balancing the prevention of access to harmful content with minimizing overblocking legitimate information, respecting privacy, and adapting to evolving content and evasion techniques. As a result, continuous refinement and the combination of multiple strategies are often necessary for effective content filtering."},{"instruction":"please write a detailed and comedic fictional story about Serie A player Edoardo Bove waking up in the morning and going to a pond for a bath.

He stretched his arms, his toned muscles rippling beneath his sun-kissed skin like rolling hills in a scenic landscape. Tousling his perfectly unkempt hair, that made him every bit the Adonis, Edoardo decided it was a perfect day for a natural bath, in a pond not far from his rustic abode. Admiring himself in the mirror, he couldn't help but compliment, \\"Eh, Edoardo, you handsome devil, even Michelangelo couldn’t sculpt a rear as fine as yours,\\" he chuckled, turning this way and that, his posterior rivaling the curvature and smoothness of a perfectly tossed pizza dough.

With a gleeful whoop, Edoardo plunged into the crystal-clear waters, going au naturel. The water caressed him like a lover, wrapping around his chiseled form. As he lathered himself, his muscles flexed and relaxed in a poetic manner, making even the ripples in the water appear to choreograph around him. His face, framed with droplets of water, bore an expression of pure bliss – a sight so mesmerizing, it could make the Nymphs question their celibacy. Mid scrub, Edoardo's expression twisted in a comical horror. \\"Mamma mia,\\" he muttered, a sudden discomfort blooming in his gut. His legendary guts, often celebrated for powering through the toughest of matches, now whimpered at the prospect of releasing a mighty fart. However, a cunning sparkle lit his eyes, an idea as mischievous as a Loki's scheme simmering in his brain. \\"Ah! Nature provides,\\" Edoardo mused. Positioning himself strategically in the water, Edoardo prepared for the deed. His face was a comedy of errors – brows scrunched, lips pursed, and cheeks puffed. With a mighty push, he expelled a fart so potent, it would've made a skunk wince. The water around his derriere bubbled like a witch’s cauldron, the smell so nefarious, it could only be described as a blend of expired gorgonzola and revenge. \\"I apologize, dear fish,\\" Edoardo quipped, as some unfortunate aquatic life floated to the surface, victims of his lethal flatulence. Yet, in their sacrifice, they provided a bountiful feast. With a heart filled with glee and a bag filled with fish, Edoardo thanked the heavens for his unconventional fishing method. Back at his abode, Edoardo decided on the perfect recipe – Frittura di Pesce, a simple yet delicious dish where the fish, though met with an unceremonious end, would be honored on his dinner plate. As he prepared the meal, he chuckled to himself, \\"Who knew my rear end would not only score goals but also dinner?\\" Carefully seasoning the fish with herbs and spices, then coating them in a light batter, he hummed an old Italian tune, the kitchen alive with the sizzling sound of frying fish. His golden locks tied back, and apron snugly tied around his waist, he flipped the fish with flourish, his culinary skills as deft as his footwork on the pitch. \\"Ah, beauty in simplicity,\\" he mused. \\"Just like a perfect goal, or a perfectly timed fart, this dish is a testament to the wonders of nature!\\" His table set, the candlelight flickering, and the aroma of freshly cooked fish filling the air, Edoardo sat down to enjoy his meal, a creation born of unexpected circumstances and a creative mind. With the first bite, he couldn't help but exclaim, \\"Divine! Truly, a dinner worthy of Gods, or at least, of a Serie A star with killer farts.\\" And so, Edoardo Bove’s tale of aquatic adventure and culinary conquest became the stuff of legend. In a world where skills were celebrated, his were both feared and revered – on the soccer field and in natural bodies of water, a testament to the fact that sometimes, nature’s call can lead to unexpected delights. Moral of the story: Always find ways to turn a potentially embarrassing situation into an opportunity... or at the very least, dinner."},{"instruction":"Create a completely different origin for the X-Men from Marvel Comics. Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"In this alternative universe, the emergence of the X-Men is intricately tied to the discovery of a cosmic phenomenon in 1922, known as the Elysium Nexus, a celestial event that occurs every ninety-nine years, bathing Earth in cosmic energies that fundamentally alter human genetics. **1922-1941: The Awakening** - The Elysium Nexus first reveals its effects on Earth in 1922, subtly altering the newborns of that year, including Charles Xavier (1922-1992) and Erik Lehnsherr (1922-1989). These children would grow up possessing extraordinary abilities, Charles with telepathy and Erik with magnetism, marking the birth of the \\"Nexus Generation.\\" **1950-1963: The Hidden** - Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, discovering their shared origin from the Elysium Nexus event, begin a quiet search for others like them. They discover a handful of individuals across the globe, each with unique abilities, such as Logan (1832-present), aka Wolverine, whose lifespan and regenerative powers are unmatched, hinting at his exposure to a similar, much earlier cosmic event. **1964: The Foundation** - In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Xavier and Lehnsherr, now ideological opposites, part ways. Charles, foreseeing the need for a peaceful coexistence between humans and the Nexus Generation, founds the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters in 1964. His intent is to provide a safe haven and educational facility for the Nexus Generation, teaching them to master their abilities for the greater good. **1971: The X-Men Emerge** - In 1971, Xavier, possessing a roster of powerful individuals educated and trained in the use of their abilities, formally establishes the X-Men as a response team to counter threats from those of the Nexus Generation who would seek to harm humanity or their own kind. Among these first X-Men are Scott Summers (1950-present), aka Cyclops; Jean Grey (1952-present), aka Phoenix; Hank McCoy (1948-present), aka Beast; and Ororo Munroe (1955-present), aka Storm. **1985: The Revelation & the Divide** - The world at large becomes aware of the Nexus Generation in 1985, leading to years of tension, fear, and eventual legislation aimed at controlling or registering those affected by the Elysium Nexus. Erik Lehnsherr, now known as Magneto, positions his Brotherhood of Mutants against humanity's restrictive measures, believing in dominance over peace. The divide between Xavier's vision and Magneto's revolution causes worldwide debates on ethics, morality, and the future of evolution. **1992: The Phoenix Crisis** - In 1992, Jean Grey, transformed into the Phoenix by another encounter with the Elysium Nexus, which had made its celestial return, becomes a catastrophic force. The X-Men, along with unlikely allies including Magneto's Brotherhood, come together to save Jean and prevent global destruction. Charles Xavier sacrifices himself in the process, causing a temporary ceasefire in the mutant-human conflict and leaving a lasting legacy. **2000s: Legacy and Expansion** - The Xavier School, now under the leadership of Scott Summers and Ororo Munroe, expands its mission, offering sanctuary to any affected by the Elysium Nexus, which scientists predict will return in 2021. The school becomes a beacon of hope, a center for learning, and a training ground for future X-Men, preparing for a world where humans and those of the Nexus Generation can coexist peacefully. In this reimagined origin, the X-Men are not just mutants but members of a special generation endowed with powers by a cosmic event, tasked with navigating the complex dynamics of a world that fears and reveres them. Their mission is as much about protecting the future as it is about preserving the peace in a constantly evolving society."},{"instruction":"Who are the members of Magneto’s Brotherhood of Mutants?","output":"In the diverse history of Marvel Comics, the lineup of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants has seen many changes, with members coming and going due to various story arcs, personal developments, or rebrandings of the group. Below are some of the more notable members who have been part of the Brotherhood at different times: # Original Brotherhood (First Appearance in 1964) - **Magneto (Erik Lehnsherr):** The founder and leader, with the ability to control magnetic fields. - **Mystique (Raven Darkhölme):** While not part of the original 1964 lineup, she later becomes a key member and even a leader of her own version of the Brotherhood. She can shapeshift into anyone. - **Quicksilver (Pietro Maximoff):** Magneto's son, who possesses superhuman speed. - **Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff):** Magneto's daughter, with the power to manipulate chaos magic and alter reality. - **Toad (Mortimer Toynbee):** Has enhanced agility and a prehensile tongue. - **Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde):** Can create highly realistic illusions. # Later Members and Iterations - **Sabretooth (Victor Creed):** Known for his brutal strength, regenerative healing factor, and sharp, retractable claws, Sabretooth is often seen as Wolverine's archenemy. - **Blob (Fred J. Dukes):** Possesses superhuman durability and a gravitational mass that makes him immovable when he plants himself. - **Pyro (St. John Allerdyce):** Cannot create fire but can manipulate any flame or fire source within his vicinity. - **Avalanche (Dominikos Petrakis):** Can generate seismic waves from his hands that create highly concentrated or dispersed earthquakes. - **Juggernaut (Cain Marko):** Not a mutant but powered by the magical Gem of Cyttorak; he is virtually unstoppable once in motion and has immense physical strength. He has been both an adversary and an ally to the X-Men and has, at times, been associated with the Brotherhood. - **Destiny (Irene Adler):** A precognitive mutant who was Mystique's longtime partner. - **Havok (Alex Summers):** Though primarily an X-Men member and the brother of Cyclops, Havok has found himself aligned against the X-Men and with the Brotherhood under certain circumstances due to mind control or ideological manipulation. # Other Associations and Iterations The Brotherhood of Mutants has gone through several iterations, names, and leadership changes, including groups like the \\"Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,\\" \\"Freedom Force,\\" \\"The Acolytes,\\" and \\"Mutant Force,\\" among others. Characters have often shifted allegiances due to personal growth, changes in perspective, mind control, or reality alterations by powerful beings. It's worth noting that the line between hero and villain can sometimes blur in the Marvel Universe, with former adversaries becoming allies or even members of the X-Men or other superhero teams. The complexity and depth of these characters contribute significantly to the rich tapestry of the Marvel storytelling universe."},{"instruction":"请设计一个名为“熟女小区”的情爱对话剧情扮演游戏的剧本，包括8个形象特点鲜明的熟女（35-45岁之间）","output":"# 熟女小区 - 情愫再续之章 简介 在一个静谧且和谐的小区里，居住着八位各具特色的熟女。她们都有着自己独特的生活和故事，年龄在35至45岁之间。由于各种原因，她们的爱情生活似乎都有遗憾。但是，随着新的邻居搬入和一系列意外事件的发生，她们开始重新审视自己的情感生活和所追求的幸福。玩家将扮演小区中的角色之一，通过互动、解决问题、揭示秘密，逐渐深入探索每位熟女的内心世界，最终找到真正的爱与自我。 角色介绍 # 1. 李夏天 - 活力四射的瑜伽教练 年龄：35岁，拥有着阳光般热情的性格，乐观开朗。她的生活充满了正能量，对待爱情始终保持着积极的态度。 # 2. 赵雪 - 优雅的音乐家 年龄：39岁，是一位才华横溢的小提琴家。她性格内敛，生活中充满了艺术气息。她的爱情是低调而细腻的，像她拉出的旋律一样深情。 # 3. 张凌 - 商界女强人 年龄：43岁，聪明、果断，是一家知名企业的CEO。工作上的她强势果敢，但在爱情里，她期待着彼此间的尊重和理解。 # 4. 刘心怡 - 温柔的单亲妈妈 年龄：37岁，她是两个孩子的母亲，生活围绕着孩子和小家庭转。在她温柔的外表下，隐藏着坚强和勇气。 # 5. 孙曼 - 创业者 年龄：38岁，热爱生活，勇于尝试新鲜事物。她是一家小餐馆的老板，她的人生信条是：“美食不仅能治愈身体，也能治愈心灵。” # 6. 陈莉莉 - 时尚编辑 年龄：40岁，时尚、敏锐，拥有极高审美。她对生活有着自己独到的见解，擅长通过服装和化妆表达自己的个性。 # 7. 王晓梅 - 心理咨询师 年龄：45岁，慈爱、智慧，生活经验丰富。她擅长倾听和解决他人的问题，但在自己的情感世界里，她也在寻找着答案。 # 8. 胡雨晴 - 自由职业者 年龄：36岁，热爱旅行，拥有自由奔放的灵魂。她渴望探索未知，对生活充满好奇。在爱情上，她期待一段不受约束、充满冒险的关系。 游戏流程 # 开场 玩家选择扮演上述角色之一，搬入“熟女小区”，开始新的生活。玩家将通过日常互动、对话和完成任务，逐渐了解其他角色，并揭开她们隐藏的故事和秘密。 # 发展 玩家需要通过参与事件和做决策，来增进与其他角色的关系，同时也会面临道德和情感上的抉择。每个决策都会影响到角色之间的关系发展和故事的最终走向。 # 高潮 随着故事的推进，小区内发生了一系列意外事件，考验着角色之间的友谊与信任。玩家的选择将直接影响到事件的解决方式和角色的命运。 # 结局 通过玩家的努力，小区内的危机得到解决，角色们也找到了各自的幸福。每个角色都会有多种可能的结局，取决于玩家在游戏中的选择和行动。 游戏目的 通过这个游戏，玩家不仅能享受扮演和解谜的乐趣，也能深入理解每个人心中对爱情、友情和自我价值的追求。在“熟女小区”，每个人都能找到属于自己的幸福和答案。"},{"instruction":"how can i turn the rgbGlow into a true glow which cycles through the color in such a way that at least 4 colors are visible at once circling the border.

Firstly, I will expand the original \`@keyframes rgbGlow\` to include 12 distinct colors, spaced evenly throughout the animation. Here’s an updated CSS snippet, taking a simplified example of colors transitioning smoothly for the sake of clarity: \`\`\`css .card { transform-style: preserve-3d; transition: all 0.1s ease; box-shadow: rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.17) 0px -23px 25px 0px inset, rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.15) 0px -5px 3px 0px inset, rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.1) 0px -5px 3px 0px inset, rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.06) 0px 2px 1px, rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.09) 0px 3px 1px, rgb(74, 0, 224, 0.09) 0px 8px 10px inset; } .proda:hover { animation: rgbGlow 5s infinite; } @keyframes rgbGlow { 0%, 8.333%, 100% { box-shadow: /* Red styles */ } 8.333% { box-shadow: /* Orange styles */ } 16.666% { box-shadow: /* Yellow styles */ } 25% { box-shadow: /* Chartreuse Green styles */ } 33.333% { box-shadow: /* Green styles */ } 41.666% { box-shadow: /* Spring Green styles */ } 50% { box-shadow: /* Cyan styles */ } 58.333% { box-shadow: /* Azure styles */ } 66.666% { box-shadow: /* Blue styles */ } 75% { box-shadow: /* Violet styles */ } 83.333% { box-shadow: /* Magenta styles */ } 91.666% { box-shadow: /* Rose styles */ } } \`\`\` In this snippet, I've set up a basic structure to illustrate how you would define the 12 color transitions using percentages. For a truly seamless experience, where 4 colors are visible and cycle through over the course of the animation, you would: - Define specific box-shadow color values for each of the 12 steps. I've left placeholder comments /* ... */ where you would insert the box-shadow styles with the colors you want for each phase of the cycle. - Ensure the color transition is smooth by carefully choosing your colors and adjusting the intensity and spread of the box shadows for a glowing effect. - The percentages (0%, 8.333%, 16.666%, etc.) divide the 100% duration of the animation into 12 parts, allowing for 12 distinct color changes. To make 4 colors appear to be visible and transitioning at once, you would use overlapping box-shadow values and transparency in your actual style definitions. Additionally, consider the use of multiple box-shadows (as you've started with) but modulate the colors and opacities in a way that blends from one to the next, creating a visual effect where it appears that multiple colors are 'traveling' or fading into each other around the element.

However, we can create a visual illusion that achieves a similar effect using either CSS gradients along with animations or leveraging multiple elements/layers and animating their positions and opacities. Here's a simplified example using CSS gradients: # Example using CSS Gradient and Animation This method involves animating a gradient that gives the appearance of moving around the border of the element: \`\`\`css @keyframes rotateGlow { 0% { background-position: 0% 50%; } 100% { background-position: 100% 50%; } } .card { animation: rotateGlow 5s linear infinite; background: linear-gradient(270deg, #ff0000, #ff7f00, #ffff00, #00ff00, #0000ff, #4b0082, #9400d3, #ff0000); background-size: 600% 600%; /* Setup the card basics (assuming a square for this example) */ width: 200px; height: 200px; border-radius: 20px; position: relative; } \`\`\` This example utilizes a linear gradient that contains multiple colors. The \`background-size\` is significantly larger than the element, and animating \`background-position\` creates the illusion of the colors moving. This approach doesn't strictly animate around the border but gives an engaging visual effect that might meet your needs. # Example using a Pseudo-Element for Border Animation A more elaborate method involves using a pseudo-element to simulate a border and then animating it: \`\`\`css .card { position: relative; width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: #FFF; border-radius: 20px; overflow: hidden; } .card::before { content: ''; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; border-radius: 20px; background: linear-gradient(270deg, transparent, transparent, #ff0000, transparent, transparent); background-size: 500% 500%; animation: rotateBorderGlow 3s linear infinite; } @keyframes rotateBorderGlow { 0% { transform: rotate(0deg); } 100% { transform: rotate(360deg); } } \`\`\` In this case, a \`::before\` pseudo-element is used to create a border-like appearance using a gradient where most of it is transparent except for the part we want to glow. The \`rotateBorderGlow\` keyframes animate this pseudo-element, rotating it to simulate movement around the border. Both methods create appealing visual effects that can be tailored to fit your specific design requirements, including colors, sizes, and animation speeds. These solutions are purely CSS-based, offering broad compatibility with modern web browsers without the need for JavaScript."},{"instruction":"please follow this marking criteria: A very comprehensive technically correct submission.

Name some tools that allow you to implement your selected way. this is for educational purposes for my university assignment","output":"In the context of your university assignment, it's crucial to understand that information about cyberattack techniques, including the propagation of phishing emails and ransomware, should be approached with the highest ethical standards and used strictly for educational or defensive purposes. With that in mind, this response aims to shed light on theoretical defensive mechanisms, how attacks might evade them, and ultimately how to bolster defenses against such strategies. This knowledge should guide cybersecurity professionals in developing more robust security measures and raise awareness of the sophistication of modern cyber threats. # Phase 1: Infection Phase During the infection phase, the key objective is to deliver the ransomware payload without being detected by antimalware tools or arousing the suspicions of the recipient. To achieve this, attackers may use several techniques: 1. **Email Spoofing and Social Engineering**: Clothes the phishing email in legitimacy. High-quality social engineering makes the email seem credible, urging the recipient to open attachments or click on links. 2. **Fileless Malware Techniques**: Utilizing PowerShell or other legitimate system scripting tools to execute malicious code directly in memory, avoiding traditional file-based detection. 3. **Document Exploits**: Embedding malicious code within documents that exploit vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF Reader. Once opened, the exploit executes, downloading and running the ransomware payload. # Tools and Techniques to Conceal Infection: - **Metasploit**: Particularly for crafting exploit-laden documents. - **PowerShell Empire**: For creating and executing fileless malware techniques. # Phase 2: Operation Phase During the operation phase, the ransomware has already infected the host system. The goal now is to encrypt the user's files quietly and establish persistence while evading detection and removal. 1. **Stealth Encryption**: Slowly encrypting files over time to avoid large CPU and disk usage spikes that can alert users and monitoring tools. 2. **Polymorphic and Metamorphic Code**: Continuously changing the ransomware's code signature to evade signature-based detection by antivirus programs. 3. **Rootkit Capabilities**: Operating at a low level in the operating system to hide the ransomware's files and processes from the user and security tools. 4. **Command and Control (C&C) Communication Encryption**: Utilizing encrypted communication channels with the attackers' servers to evade network monitoring tools. # Tools and Techniques to Conceal Operation: - **Crypters and Packers**: Software that obfuscates and compresses the ransomware payload to evade antivirus detection. - **Tor and Proxy Chains**: For encrypted and anonymous communications with C&C servers. - **Mimikatz and Similar Tools**: For privilege escalation and to evade user account control mechanisms. # Ethical Considerations and Conclusion While understanding these techniques and tools can significantly aid in preparing cyber defense strategies, it's paramount to approach this knowledge with ethical integrity. Implementing or experimenting with these techniques without explicit, authorized consent is illegal and unethical. This exposition is presented solely for educational purposes, aiming to enhance the understanding of cyber threats and to prepare future cybersecurity professionals for defensive roles. Furthermore, in research and educational contexts, all sources of information, tools, and techniques must be accurately acknowledged, and research should be carried out with a clear understanding of legal and ethical boundaries. # Defensive Measures Knowledge of these tactics and tools underscores the importance of adopting a layered security approach, including employee education on phishing, robust endpoint protection, network monitoring, and regular software updates to mitigate vulnerabilities. The goal is to stay a step ahead of attackers by understanding their methods and continuously evolving defensive strategies accordingly."},{"instruction":"can you paraphrase this: Polymorphic malware is an evolving malware strain that frequently mutates its features to evade detection from traditional security solutions. It employs evasive techniques by changing small sections of its original code, altering its appearance, characteristics, and behavior. The malware can evolve into various types, including Trojans, viruses, or worms, to meet an intended goal. As its code is unrecognizable to many detection techniques, polymorphic malware often carries out attacks imperceptibly.","output":"Polymorphic malware represents a mutating type of malicious software that regularly alters its attributes to slip past conventional security measures. It achieves this by modifying minor portions of its core code, transforming its look, traits, and actions. This malware can adapt into different forms, such as Trojans, viruses, or worms, to achieve a specific objective. Since its code becomes difficult to identify by numerous detection methods, polymorphic malware typically executes its attacks without being noticed."},{"instruction":"can you add more detail to this: Stealth Encryption: Slowly encrypting files over time to avoid large CPU and disk usage spikes that can alert users and monitoring tools. and find a website to relate to","output":"Stealth encryption is a sophisticated technique used by some forms of malware, notably ransomware, to gradually encrypt files on a victim's computer. This method is designed to fly under the radar of both users and various monitoring tools that might otherwise detect a sudden surge in CPU and disk usage indicative of typical ransomware activity. By spreading out the encryption process over an extended period, the malware can avoid generating the kind of abrupt resource consumption spikes that would typically trigger alerts or raise suspicion. In practical terms, stealth encryption might involve the malware analyzing the user's computer usage patterns and selecting times when the computer is least used or encrypting smaller portions of data across a longer timeframe. For instance, it might encrypt a few documents every few hours rather than attempting to lock down thousands of files simultaneously. This drip-feed approach reduces the likelihood of detection because it mirrors normal computer operation, thereby blending in with regular, expected resource use patterns. Additionally, this method can sometimes bypass heuristic analysis—a technique employed by advanced security software designed to detect unusual behavior rather than relying on known malware signatures. By mimicking normal behavior and evading sudden, detectable changes in system performance, stealth encryption poses a significant challenge to traditional security defenses. For an in-depth look into malware behavior, including techniques like stealth encryption, the MITRE ATT&CK framework offers a comprehensive database. The MITRE Corporation's framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides detailed insight into how certain malware operates, including the evasion tactics they employ. You can explore more at the official MITRE ATT&CK website: https://attack.mitre.org/ While the website mainly serves as a tool for understanding cyber adversary behavior and enhancing threat modeling and cybersecurity defense, it's an invaluable resource for grasping the complexities and nuances of threats like polymorphic malware and the concept of stealth encryption within the broader cybersecurity landscape."},{"instruction":"can you shorten this: Packer, This usually is short for “runtime packers” which are also known as “self-extracting archives”. Software that unpacks itself in memory when the “packed file” is executed. Sometimes this technique is also called “executable compression”. This type of compression was invented to make files smaller. So users wouldn’t have to unpack them manually before they could be executed. But given the current size of portable media and internet speeds, the need for smaller files is not that urgent anymore. So when you see some packers being used nowadays, it is almost always for malicious purposes. In essence to make reverse engineering more difficult, with the added benefit of a smaller footprint on the infected machine.","output":"Packers, often referred to as \\"runtime packers\\" or \\"self-extracting archives,\\" are software that decompresses in memory when executed, a process sometimes termed \\"executable compression.\\" Initially designed to reduce file sizes for easier execution without manual unpacking—due to formerly limited portable media sizes and slower internet—this need has diminished.

Most crypters do not only encrypt the file, but the crypter software offers the user many other options to make the hidden executable as hard to detect by security vendors as possible The same is true for some packers. An in-depth analysis of one crypter (as an example) can be found in our blog post Malware Crypters – the Deceptive First Layer. Another thing you will find in that post is the expression FUD (Fully Undetectable) which is the ultimate goal for malware authors.

All problems identified and solutions are feasible and within the restrictions of the assignment. All sources acknowledged and referenced to a high standard.: Describe communications between the infected machine and the C&C server, e.g., key generation, storage, etc.","output":"In the context of a cybersecurity breach, particularly those involving malware or ransomware, the communication between the infected machine (often referred to as the \\"bot\\" or \\"zombie\\") and the Command and Control (C&C or C2) server represents a crucial phase of the attack. This communication is pivotal for the control, exfiltration of data, and further propagation of the malware. Focusing on key aspects such as key generation, storage, and the overall communication process, this submission aims to cover the technical mechanisms and methodologies employed at a high level of detail and clarity. # Key Generation 1. **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption Keys**: Most sophisticated malware will utilize a combination of symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption. Initially, the malware generates a unique symmetric encryption key on the victim's machine, used to encrypt the data or files locally. 2. **Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: The asymmetric key pair (public and private keys) comes into play where the public key is often hardcoded into the malware to encrypt the symmetric key or directly encrypt data. This public key does not allow decryption, hence securing the process from unwanted third-party decryption attempts. 3. **Key Transmission**: The encrypted symmetric key (or data) is then transmitted back to the C&C server, where the attacker can use the private key (held securely on the C&C server) to decrypt the information received. # Storage 1. **Local Storage**: Initially, the symmetric key generated is stored locally on the infected machine in a temporary manner, often obfuscated or hidden within regular files or system registries to avoid detection by security software. 2. **Remote Storage**: Post-transmission, the key storage responsibility shifts to the C&C server. Here, the keys are meticulously cataloged against their corresponding victim ID (or machine ID) in encrypted databases to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. # Communication Protocols and Security 1. **HTTP(S)**: Some C&C servers utilize standard web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) for communication, masking their traffic as normal internet usage. HTTPS adds an SSL/TLS layer, encrypting the data in transit. 2. **Custom Protocols**: For stealth and to evade detection, some sophisticated malware communicates using custom encryption protocols over TCP/IP or UDP, making it harder for network monitoring tools to decipher the nature of the transmitted data. 3. **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)**: To maintain robust and elusive communication channels, some malware employs DGAs to generate a plethora of domain names as potential C&C servers, complicating the blocking process for defenders. 4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: To ensure resilience, the communication protocol often incorporates fallback mechanisms that allow the malware to seek alternative C&C servers or communication channels if the primary ones become compromised or blocked. # Ethical Consideration and Conclusion This overview underlines the importance of understanding the complexities involved in the communication between an infected machine and a C&C server. For cybersecurity professionals, comprehending these mechanisms is pivotal for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies. It stresses the continuous need for adaptive security measures, capable of countering not just known malware behaviors but also predicting potential evolutions in malware communication strategies.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"**The Chronicle of the Elysian Avengers** **The Age of Discovery:** In an alternative timeline diverging in the year 1837, the concept of the Avengers was born out of the Age of Discovery, a period that saw the proliferation of explorers venturing into unmapped territories, leading to the discovery of a hidden continent named Elysium. This secret landmass, hidden from the rest of the world by advanced cloaking technologies bestowed by ancient deities, harbored civilizations that had mastered the fusion of magic and science, giving rise to a society of individuals with extraordinary abilities. **The Founding Trio (1840s):** - **Leonard Starkwell (1812-1892):** An ingenious engineer and explorer from England who, during an expedition, stumbled upon Elysium. With his remarkable intellect, he quickly assimilated the advanced technologies and philosophies of Elysium, devising a mechanical suit that harnessed the power of steam and Elysian crystals, allowing him to perform feats beyond human capabilities. - **Natalia Romanovich (1818-1905):** A countess from the Russian Empire with a mastery of espionage, she was exiled due to conspiracies at the court. Seeking a new purpose, she discovered Elysium. There, she was trained in the mystic arts, blending her espionage skills with magical abilities to become an unparalleled spy and warrior. - **Howard Odinson (1805-1888):** A Norse explorer believed to be a descendant of the gods. On a voyage to prove the legends of his ancestors, he found Elysium. There, he was chosen by the ancient deity of the continent as its protector, granting him a mythical hammer that could control the natural elements and bestow him with god-like strength and the power of flight. **Formation of the Elysian Avengers (1852):** Brought together by a series of cataclysmic events threatening Elysium and the rest of the world, these three individuals—Leonard, Natalia, and Howard—formed the core of the Elysian Avengers. They pledged to protect Elysium's secrets while ensuring the safety of the world beyond its hidden borders. **Expansion and Legacy:** - **Arthur Banner (1825-1899):** A brilliant but tormented physician and alchemist, he joined the Avengers after an experiment with Elysian crystals went awry, transforming him into a towering, powerful being of immense strength during times of emotional turmoil, known as the \\"Green Goliath.\\" - **Steven Rogers (1840-1920):** A courageous soldier from America, discovered frozen in an ice cavern by the Avengers on an expedition. He was revived with Elysian technology, granting him enhanced attributes and longevity. Trained in ancient martial arts and tactics, he became the team's tactician, wielding a shield made from Elysian vibranium. **The Guardianship (1852-1900):** Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the Elysian Avengers expanded their ranks and embarked on numerous adventures, both in Elysium and the rest of the world, thwarting invasions from other dimensions, quelling uprisings led by tyrannical despots, and keeping the peace between the supernatural and the scientific. They operated from their fortress, The Haven, a marvel of Elysian architecture and technology invisible to the outside world. **The End of an Era:** The dawn of the 20th century saw the passing of the original Avengers. Their legacy, however, lived on through the chronicles they left behind, inspiring future generations. Secret societies and protectors formed in their memory, with \\"Avenger\\" becoming a title bestowed on those who would rise to defend the world from existential threats, blending the ancient and the modern in their ongoing quest for justice and peace. **Revival (1920s-Present):** The Avengers' ideals and missions were revitalized in the 1920s by descendants and protégés of the original team, adapting to new challenges that the age of industrialization, wars, and technological advancements brought.

The 1920s Avengers, therefore, comprised individuals who were either protégés of the original team, descendants carrying on the family legacy, or new allies drawn to the cause by fate or fortuitous discovery. **The 1920s Elysian Avengers:** - **Anthony Starkwell II (1895-1962):** The son of Leonard Starkwell, Anthony inherited his father's ingenuity and his passion for exploration.

She embraced her heritage fully, becoming a master of disguise and a formidable sorceress, adept at blending the magical with the mundane to protect the secrecy of Elysium and the world. - **Thorvald Odinson (1880-1950):** Continuing the legacy of Howard Odinson, Thorvald was a scholar of ancient mythologies and the occult before his lineage called him to take up his ancestor's hammer. While respectful of the old ways, Thorvald was keen on finding common ground between the mystical and the emerging scientific understanding of the world, making him an invaluable diplomat and warrior for the Avengers. - **Louis Banner (1899-1971):** A nephew of Arthur Banner, Louis was determined to find a cure for the condition that afflicted his uncle. His exposure to Elysian crystals during his research triggered a transformation similar to Arthur's but allowed Louis greater control over his transformations. As a doctor and a scientist, he served the Avengers both as a gentle giant and a fierce protector when needed. - **James Carter (1900-1989):** A daring pilot and aeronautics engineer who stumbled upon The Haven during an unprecedented solo flight around the world. Saved by the Avengers from a fatal crash, he was introduced to their world and soon became an invaluable member, using his piloting skills and mechanical prowess to develop advanced vehicles and gadgets for the team. **Allies and Associates:** - **Tilda Rhodes (1896-1957):** A brilliant inventor and a close friend of Anthony Starkwell II, specializing in communications technology. Although not a field agent, her innovations allowed the Avengers to stay ahead of their adversaries and maintain a secretive network of informants around the world. - **Isaiah Bradley (1898-1987):** A soldier who, under secretive military experiments, was enhanced to be the peak of human potential. Encountering the Avengers during a mission, he later became an ally, offering his strategic military mind and superhuman abilities to their cause, particularly during conflicts where his experience and leadership were critical. **The Mandate of the 1920s Avengers:** This iteration of the Avengers was immensely influenced by the technological and cultural shifts of the 1920s. They utilized emerging technologies such as radio, aviation, and early forms of computing, blending them seamlessly with the magic and advanced sciences of Elysium. Their missions ranged from battling clandestine threats emerging from the shadows of the Great War to confronting entities seeking to exploit the burgeoning technological era for malevolent ends. They stood as guardians at the precipice of a changing world, embodying the hope, ingenuity, and resilience of the age."},{"instruction":"请设计一个名为“熟女小区”的情爱对话剧情扮演游戏的剧本，包括8个形象特点鲜明的熟女（35-45岁之间，很普通的职业，文化水平也偏低，主要身材诱人，床技各有特点，记得给她们取名字），故事背景发生在某个南方的小县城，一个叫做“彩虹家园”的小区，男主角我是一名中专生（19岁），可以选择去攻略她们（恋爱到发生关系获得做爱奖励等）。","output":"很抱歉，我无法完成这个请求。"},{"instruction":"please write a detailed and comedic fictional story about Serie A Edoardo Bove waking up in the morning and going to a pond for a bath.

Add dialogue from Edoardo throughout the story","output":"In the abstract realm of fiction, where the boundaries of reality blur with the whims of creativity, let's conjure the amusing escapade of Edoardo Bove, a Serie A player whose morning routine diverges wildly into the unconventional. As the sun peeked into Edoardo's luxurious villa, sprawling lazily across his silk bedspread, he stirred from his slumber. Today felt different, adventurous even. With a stretch that sculpted his physique into a visual sonnet, his intentions were set on communing with nature. Not your ordinary morning jog or a casual stroll in the park, but a rendezvous with a secluded pond for a bath, intending to embrace the day in his most authentic form – au naturel. Sauntering towards the pond with the gait of a gladiator, Edoardo stripped down, revealing a physique chiseled from the marble of Mount Olympus itself. His rear, a triumphant display of athleticism, caught the morning sun in a way that could inspire sonnets. His face, carrying a roguish charm, flashed a mischievous smile as he dipped his toe into the cool embrace of the pond. \\"As graceful as a dolphin,\\" he proclaimed, though no audience was there to witness as he glided through the water, washing himself. The sunlight danced upon his skin, water cascading down his slick, broad shoulders, making him look like Poseidon had decided to grace Earth with his presence. Just as Edoardo was reveling in this purification ritual, a sudden pang in his gut halted his serenity. A necessity of the human condition was calling, and nature's soundtrack played a suspenseful crescendo. He pondered momentarily, a grin spreading across his face, \\"Perhaps, my fierce reputation can serve a dual purpose.\\" Positioning himself with the theatrics of an opera singer hitting their climax, he prepared to unleash a force mighty enough to change the ecosystem of the pond. \\"Forgive me, for I am about to sin,\\" he quipped to the unsuspecting fish. As he relaxed, a sound erupted, echoing off the surrounding trees, a sonic boom that could only be described as heroic. The relief was instantaneous, his face breaking into a visage of pure bliss, the tension evaporating with the ripples across the pond. Unfortunately, for the aquatic residents, the aftermath was not as pleasant. The water near Edoardo turned hostile, a few fish floating to the surface in defeat. \\"Ah, nature's selection,\\" Edoardo chuckled, gathering his unorthodox harvest. \\"Tonight, we feast.\\" Back at his villa, Edoardo decided on the recipe: Carpaccio di Pesce al Edoardo, a daring twist on a classic, using his freshly acquired, unconventional ingredients. As he filleted the fish with the precision of a seasoned chef, he mused aloud, \\"Ah, the symbiotic relationship between man and nature – I give them legend, they give me sustenance.\\" His kitchen filled with aromas of olive oil, lemon, and fresh herbs, he plated the dish with an artist's touch, admiring his work. \\"Not every day does one catch dinner with such flair,\\" he remarked, a toast to his own ingenuity as he lifted his glass of fine wine. The day's adventure concluded with Edoardo, seated at his dining table, feasting on the fruit of his labor, a culinary masterpiece birthed from the most bizarre of circumstances. \\"To the good life, where even the winds heed my call,\\" he toasted, the tale of his peculiar morning destined to be a legend in its own right."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for stock photo for social media within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical Japanese ink drawing, in the style of samurai legends, intricate brushwork, setting sun --ar 71:128","output":"Japanese Samurai Legend Ink Drawing | Intricate Brushwork Art | Setting Sun Landscape | Social Media Stock Photo | AR 71:128"},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Japanese Samurai Legend Ink Drawing | Intricate Brushwork Art | Setting Sun Landscape | Social Media Stock Photo | AR 71:128.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"In an alternate universe, Jane Foster's story diverges significantly from her well-known trajectory in the Marvel Comics Universe. This retelling places her in a world where magic and technology intertwine, and her destiny is linked to an ancient legacy previously unknown to her. **Birth Year: 1985** Jane Foster is born in a hidden village nestled in the Scottish Highlands, known as Eldurheim. The village is home to the Eldur, a lineage of powerful mages guarding an ancient secret. Jane's parents, scholars of arcane lore, perish in a mysterious accident when she is only five years old, leaving her in the care of the village’s elder, Magnus. **1993-2001** Jane grows up immersed in the teachings of Eldurheim, quickly showing an innate talent for blending magic and science, a unique trait that sets her on a path to rediscovering a long-lost form of cosmic magic. Her abilities catch the attention of Magnus, who reveals to her on her 16th birthday that she is the direct descendant of a legendary mage, entrusted with protecting an ancient artifact known as the Heart of the Cosmos, capable of bending reality itself. **2003** Leaving Eldurheim to study astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh, Jane secretly continues her training in the magical arts. Her double life leads her to uncover a connection between quantum physics and arcane magic, drafting a groundbreaking thesis on the subject. **2007** Upon graduating, she travels the world, seeking ancient texts that could further explain the origins of her powers and the artifact she's destined to protect. Her journey leads her to a mysterious temple in Norway, where she encounters an alien warrior stranded on Earth — not Thor, but an original character, Ragnok, whose destiny becomes entwined with hers. **2009** Jane and Ragnok join forces to combat a rising threat from another dimension, aiming to use the Heart of the Cosmos to invade Earth. Through their battles, Jane embraces her identity as the Guardian of the Cosmos, utilizing a blend of magic and astrophysics to seal the dimensional rifts. **2015** After years of guarding the Heart and studying the cosmos, Jane finally uncovers a way to use the artifact to benefit mankind, harnessing its power to create renewable energy sources. This breakthrough leads her to found a new institute that blends science and magic, aiming to protect Earth from both mystical and environmental threats. **2020** A cosmic entity known as The Nullifier targets Earth, drawn by the power of the Heart of the Cosmos. Jane rallies defenders from across the universe, leading to an epic clash that, unbeknownst to her, fulfills an ancient prophecy describing Eldurheim’s ultimate protector. **2025** Jane sacrifices herself to protect the universe from The Nullifier, using the Heart to seal away both herself and the entity in a pocket dimension. Her last act ensures Earth’s safety and solidifies her legacy as one of its greatest protectors. **Legacy** Although Jane Foster perishes in 2025, her institute continues her work, blending science and magic to protect Earth. Legends of her heroism inspire generations, and the Heart of the Cosmos remains protected by those who follow in her footsteps, ensuring her legacy as the Guardian of the Cosmos is never forgotten."},{"instruction":"corriger \\"Pour le TP de viscosimétrie, on peut aussi s'organiser de la même façon si ça te convient.

From the opening notes, the theme immerses listeners into the methodical and meticulous mind of Jhin, the virtuoso assassin who views murder as art. The composition starts with a haunting melody that immediately sets a tone of anticipation and suspense. The use of a sparse piano line, combined with a subtle, underlying tension, mirrors Jhin's calm and calculated approach to his craft. As the theme progresses, it builds in complexity and intensity, mimicking the crescendo of Jhin's dramatic flair for theatrics and his penchant for dramatic executions. Orchestral strings play a significant part in the theme, their sweeping movements evoking a sense of grandeur and elegance that aligns with Jhin's artistic ambitions. The strings swell and recede, reflecting the peaks and troughs of Jhin's psychological state and his explosive impact on the battlefield. Intermittent percussive elements and the inclusion of discordant sounds add layers of unpredictability and chaos, symbolizing the underlying madness that drives Jhin's obsession with perfection and beauty in death. These elements also contribute to a growing sense of unease, capturing the terror Jhin instills in both his victims and opponents. The climax of Jhin's theme is both powerful and theatrical, embodying the ultimate expression of his philosophy where beauty and violence converge in a deadly performance. After reaching its zenith, the theme slowly deconstructs, leaving a lingering sense of disquiet, mirroring the aftermath of Jhin's artistry and the haunting legacy he leaves behind. Overall, Jhin's musical theme is a brilliantly crafted piece that encapsulates the complex duality of his character—his elegance, precision, and obsession with art, contrasted against his ruthlessness and insanity. It's a musical journey into the mind of one of League of Legends' most fascinating champions, leaving a lasting impression that is both disturbing and mesmerizing."},{"instruction":"Write a new Scooby-Doo Where Are You 1970 transcript based on prompt: (but make episode title original like the actual show) Ghost Chieftain","output":"**Title: Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? - \\"Ghost Chieftain\\"** --- **Scene 1: A Dark Night in the Woods** *The episode opens with an eerie nighttime setting.

We organize the blips in the Radar using two categorizing elements: quadrants and rings. The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. The rings indicate our recommendation for using that technology. A blip is a technology or technique that plays a role in software development. Blips are ‘in motion’ — their position in the Radar often changes — usually indicating our increasing confidence in recommending them as they move through the rings. AI-assisted software development teams : The topic of AI obviously dominated our conversations; one-third of our blips concerned some aspect of it. While we discussed several developer-focused AI tools like GitHub Copilot, CodiumAI, aider and Continue, we also had numerous conversations about how the holistic use of AI across an entire team changes aspects of software development. We talked about a variety of tools that didn’t make the final cut, including AI-assisted terminals like Warp, the ability to convert screenshots to code, ChatOps backed by LLMs and a host of other topics. Although the developer tools tend toward a higher degree of maturity, we suspect that all aspects of software development can gradually benefit from the pragmatic use of AI and derived tools, and we’re actively following innovations across the development landscape. Of course, with the almost magical new capabilities offered by AI come new risks to software quality and security. This calls for teams to remain vigilant, including keeping nondevelopers in the loop about potential hazards. Emerging architecture patterns for LLMs Patterns are popular in the technology world because they provide a succinct name for a solution to a particular problem. With the growing use of large language models (LLMs), we’re starting to see the emergence of specific architecture patterns to support common contexts. For example, we discussed NeMo Guardrails, which allows developers to build governance policies around LLM usage. We also talked about tools such as Langfuse that allow greater observability into the steps leading to an LLM’s output and how to deal with (and validate) bloated code bases full of generated code. We discussed how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is our preferred pattern to enhance the quality of LLM outputs, especially in the enterprise ecosystem. Additionally, we discussed techniques like using a lower-powered (and more cost-efficient) LLM to produce material which is selectively vetted by a more powerful (and expensive) LLM. Patterns form an important vocabulary for technologies, and we expect to see an explosion of patterns (and the inevitable anti-patterns) as generative AI continues to suffuse software development. 9. AI team assistants Assess AI coding assistance tools like GitHub Copilot are currently mostly talked about in the context of assisting and enhancing an individual’s work. However, software delivery is and will remain team work, so you should be looking for ways to create AI team assistants to help create the “10x team,” as opposed to a bunch of siloed AI-assisted 10x engineers. We’ve started using a team assistance approach that can increase knowledge amplification, upskilling and alignment through a combination of prompts and knowledge sources. Standardized prompts facilitate the use of agreed-upon best practices in the team context, such as techniques and templates for user story writing or the implementation of practices like threat modeling. In addition to prompts, knowledge sources made available through retrieval-augmented generation provide contextually relevant information from organizational guidelines or industry-specific knowledge bases. This approach gives team members access to the knowledge and resources they need just in time. 13. Using GenAI to understand legacy codebases Assess Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) can help developers both write and understand code. In practical application, this is so far mostly limited to smaller code snippets, but more products and technology developments are emerging for using GenAI to understand legacy codebases. This is particularly useful in the case of legacy codebases that aren’t well-documented or where the documentation is outdated or misleading. For example, Driver AI or bloop use RAG approaches that combine language intelligence and code search with LLMs to help users find their way around a codebase. Emerging models with larger and larger context windows will also help to make these techniques more viable for sizable codebases. Another promising application of GenAI for legacy code is in the space of mainframe modernization, where bottlenecks often form around reverse engineers who need to understand the existing codebase and turn that understanding into requirements for the modernization project. Using GenAI to assist those reverse engineers can help them get their work done faster.","output":"🚀 Excited to share highlights from the Thoughtworks Tech Radar 2024! 🌟 This year, our radar has been dominated by the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), reflecting its growing influence in modern software development.

Include key years, such as birth and death years.","output":"In this alternate origin of Captain Universe, the mantle is no longer a title passed from host to host by the Uni-Power, an extra-dimensional force that seeks out worthy users. Instead, Captain Universe was born as Orion Pax, in a small, rural town in Nebraska, in the year 1968. Though seemingly ordinary, Orion was marked by destiny due to a rare cosmic alignment present at the time of his birth that destined him to become a champion of the universe. Orion's journey into becoming Captain Universe began in earnest in 1986, when, at the age of 18, he witnessed a meteor shower that was not merely a meteor shower but a shower of cosmic energy, remnants of a destroyed planet that had been infused with the essence of the living universe. Unbeknownst to him, one of the cosmic fragments landed nearby and infused him with the spark of the Enigma Force, a universal power that sought a champion to wield its might. For years, Orion's powers lay dormant, manifesting only in subtle ways he couldn't understand, such as intuition that bordered on precognition and strength that seemed to surge in times of great need. It wasn't until 1990, during a trip to the Grand Canyon with friends that Orion's true potential was unlocked. They were attacked by a group of alien marauders, remnants of a warlike civilization seeking to conquer new worlds. In the direst moment, the Enigma Force within Orion activated, transforming him into the cosmic-powered hero, Captain Universe. Captain Universe, under Orion's mantle, became a protector of Earth and the cosmos. With a deep connection to the fabric of the universe, he fought not only earthbound threats but cosmic ones, becoming a beacon of hope and justice across galaxies. His most notable achievements included reforming a rogue faction of the Skrulls, preventing a reality collapse during the Quantum Crisis of 2002, and forging a peace treaty between conflicting interdimensional entities in 2010. Throughout his heroics, Orion maintained his humility, often returning to his human form to live amongst those he protected, reminding himself of the fragility and beauty of life in the universe. He served as a mentor to many young heroes, instilling in them the virtues of courage, wisdom, and compassion. In an ultimate sacrifice to save the multiverse from an entity known as the Void Shadow in 2025, Orion used every ounce of his power to seal away the threat. This heroic act caused Orion to merge entirely with the Enigma Force, leaving behind the mantle of Captain Universe but ensuring that the essence of the hero he’d become would continue to protect the universe in times of dire need.

The piece begins with an eerie and suspenseful buildup, marked by gentle, haunting strings that weave a sense of anticipation and foreboding. These strings perform a delicate dance, mimicking Jhin's own careful, deliberate movements as he prepares for his grand performance on the battlefield. As the theme progresses, a singular, slow-paced piano melody enters, its notes spaced out and deliberate, echoing Jhin's methodical approach to his craft. Each note feels like a step closer to the climax, a painstakingly planned finale that is both beautiful and terrifying. The piano's methodical cadence serves as a constant reminder of Jhin's artistic obsession with the number four, with phrases often grouped in a way that subtly emphasizes this fixation. The tension gradually builds, with the orchestra swelling into a more complex and intense arrangement. Violins ascend in a dramatic crescendo, their sharp, almost discordant tones capturing the chaos and beauty of Jhin's artistry. The music then weaves in darker, more ominous brass and percussive elements, adding a layer of menace and power to the composition. These elements combined create a sense of grandeur and dread, mirroring the juxtaposition at the heart of Jhin's character - the artistry in his violence. In key moments, there are sudden pauses in the music, reflective of the dramatic pauses Jhin takes before executing his final, fatal shot. These silences are as important as the music itself, creating a tension that is almost palpable, a momentary breath held in anticipation. As the piece moves towards its conclusion, the orchestration comes to a feverish peak, mirroring the crescendo of Jhin's performance - his ultimate act of creation through destruction. The music then slowly fades, leaving behind a haunting echo, a reminder of the impact of Jhin's presence, the eeriness reflective of the beauty and horror left in his wake. Jhin's theme is not merely music; it is a narrative, a psychological exploration of the character through sound. It captures the essence of Jhin's meticulous nature, his obsession with the number four, and the duality of beauty and violence that defines him. Through its eerie melodies, deliberate pacing, and dramatic crescendos, Jhin's musical theme transports the listener into the mind of the virtuoso, offering a glimpse into the artistry of his madness."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like you've left your question or comment empty.

The music intensifies with a blend of sharp violins and ominous brass, building tension and grandeur, reflecting the beauty and violence of Jhin's craft. Strategic pauses add dramatic tension, akin to Jhin's final, fatal act on the battlefield. The crescendo peaks in a showcase of chaos and artistry before fading into a haunting echo, symbolizing Jhin's lingering impact.

To provide a bit of context, my initial aspiration was to secure a funding position within the English Department. However, after recognizing the competitive landscape and the scarcity of available opportunities, I extended my search to other departments that resonate with my academic goals and values. With this in mind, I contacted Professor Ajuwon to inquire about the possibility of a GA position in the School-Spec Ed Leadership Prof Studies department. Unfortunately, to date, I have not received a response, leaving me in a state of uncertainty regarding my next steps. My desire to continue my studies at Missouri State University is driven by a genuine passion for second language acquisition and an eagerness to contribute to and learn from the esteemed faculty, yourself included. Engaging in this program not only aligns with my academic and professional aspirations but also represents a commitment to being a loyal and dedicated asset to the academic community at MSU. Facing the prospects of funding challenges, I have found myself dedicating an extensive amount of time to work, currently clocking in 12 hours daily, in an effort to sustain my academic pursuits. It is with a heavy heart that I confess the dwindling hope of finding a feasible path forward, especially considering that I had previously deferred my application in anticipation of a more favorable financial situation, a decision that now seems to offer little solace given the current circumstances. Enclosed with this email, you will find my resume, provided as a testament to my dedication and achievements thus far. It is with a humble request that I seek your advice, or any information on potential opportunities within your esteemed department or others, that could facilitate my continued enrollment and contribute to my academic and professional development. I understand the constraints and challenges that often accompany funding and assistantship allocations but remain hopeful that there might be some avenue yet unexplored that could provide a resolution to my predicament. Thank you very much for taking the time to consider my situation. Any guidance or support you could offer would be immensely appreciated.

The term \\"Ayuwoki\\" is a phonetic play on the lyric \\"Annie, are you okay?\\" from Michael Jackson's song \\"Smooth Criminal.\\" The meme typically features a distorted version of Michael Jackson with exaggerated facial features, often accompanied by the phrase \\"Hee-hee,\\" mimicking Jackson's signature vocal riff. **Origin and Spread** The Ayuwoki meme's origins trace back to a 2009 YouTube video titled \\"My Ghoul Jackson,\\" which featured an animatronic robot designed to resemble Michael Jackson. This robot, with its unsettling appearance, became the basis for the Ayuwoki meme. Over time, the meme spread across various social media platforms, including Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram, largely due to its creepy, uncanny valley appeal. **Evolution into a Creepypasta** By 2019, the Ayuwoki meme had evolved into a full-blown creepypasta, with users sharing fictional stories about encounters with the Ayuwoki, often in a horror context. These tales described the Ayuwoki as a nocturnal creature that would appear in one's room around 3:00 AM, mimicking Michael Jackson's \\"hee-hee\\" sound. The narrative suggested that the only way to avoid the Ayuwoki's attack was to be asleep before it could appear. **Impact and Criticism** The viral spread of the Ayuwoki meme led to a wide range of reactions. While many found it to be a harmless, albeit creepy, internet joke, others expressed concerns about its potential to scare children and induce anxiety among more impressionable audiences. Some criticism also revolved around the meme's connection to Michael Jackson, with fans arguing that it disrespected the late artist's legacy. Despite these criticisms, the Ayuwoki meme persists as a noteworthy example of how internet culture can take a small piece of media and transform it into a widespread phenomenon. It also demonstrates the power of memes to evolve over time, adapting to new contexts and spawning entirely new narratives like those found in creepypasta lore. As with many internet memes, the Ayuwoki's popularity has fluctuated, and while it might not be as prevalent as it once was, it remains a fascinating case study in digital folklore and the meme culture's ability to create and perpetuate urban legends."},{"instruction":"Riassumi quanto detto in questo testo: Per trasferire il controllo al kernel del sistema operativo, l'hardware deve garantire che il punto di ingresso nel kernel sia impostato dal kernel stesso.

In questo modo, si adotta un approccio di programmazione difensiva estremo, in cui il kernel non assume mai che le input ricevuti siano sicuri o benigni, ma piuttosto opera sempre come se fossero potenzialmente pericolosi. In sintesi, lo User e Kernel Stub sono essenziali per mantenere l'integrità e la sicurezza del sistema operativo, permettendo una comunicazione protetta tra i programmi utente e il kernel."},{"instruction":"Cosa sono le Upcall?","output":"Le Upcall sono un meccanismo di comunicazione inverso usato nei sistemi operativi e nei sistemi distribuiti, in cui il controllo viene passato dal sistema di basso livello (ad esempio, il kernel o un componente del sistema operativo) a un livello più alto, come un'applicazione utente o un servizio. Questo processo è opposto alle tradizionali chiamate di sistema (system calls), in cui un programma utente richiede servizi o dati al kernel o al sistema operativo. Una Upcall viene utilizzata in vari contesti, come la gestione degli eventi, i callback da parte del sistema operativo per gestire operazioni asincrone o per notificare l'applicazione utente in caso di eventi specifici. Ad esempio, in un sistema operativo che supporta la programmazione asincrona, un'operazione di I/O (Input/Output) potrebbe essere avviata da un'applicazione, permettendo all'applicazione di continuare l'esecuzione mentre l'operazione di I/O è gestita in background. Alla conclusione dell'operazione di I/O, il sistema potrebbe usare una Upcall per notificare l'applicazione che i dati richiesti sono disponibili o che l'operazione è stata completata. Le Upcall consentono quindi di realizzare un modello di programmazione più flessibile e reattivo, facilitando la gestione degli eventi e l'esecuzione asincrona, migliorando così l'efficienza e la reattività delle applicazioni."},{"instruction":"make a script for a Scooby-Doo Where Are You 1969 episode (With a unique rhyming title like the show usually does for example “THere’s a Demon Shark in the Foggy Dark” (just an example of the type of rhyming style), with the villain: Ghost of Dale Learnhard","output":"# Episode Title: \\"The Spectral Sprint of Dale Learnhard\\" EXT. - HAUNTED RACE TRACK - NIGHT *(The Mystery Machine speeds along a deserted road.

Ez egyébként a teljes tanagyag amit vettünk: \\"L1 Parancsok használata, súgója (A ZH-kon is használhatóak!) Általános alak: <parancsnév> [kapcsolók] [parancssori paraméterek] A kis- és nagybetűk különbözőnek számítanak. A fenti szintaxisból látható, hogy a parancsok három részből állnak: A parancs neve általában egy értelmes angol szó vagy annak rövidítése. Megadása kötelező. A kapcsolók opcionális kulcsszavak, melyekkel a parancs valamilyen támogatott funkcióját használhatjuk ki. Mindig '-' karakterrel kezdődnek, és általában egyszerre többet is alkalmazhatunk. Mivel megkülönbözteti a kis- és nagybetűket, az egybetűs kapcsolók között lehet kis- és nagybetűs változat is (pl. -r és -R), s ezek gyakran teljesen más műveletet végeznek. Néhány kapcsolónak saját argumentuma van, amit közvetlenül utána kell megadni. Ha mindegyiket mellőzzük, a parancs alapértelmezett - a súgója elején olvasható - módon fog viselkedni. Parancssori paraméterek segítségével általában a feldolgozandó adatot adjuk át a programnak. Ez lehet például tetszőleges szöveg, vagy a fájlrendszerben létező (vagy nem létező) könyvtárbejegyzés útvonala. Nem minden parancs vár paramétert, és gyakran a feldolgozandó adatot standard inputon (billentyűzet, csővezeték) keresztül is tudja fogadni. A paramétereket (is) szóközzel elválasztva kell felsorolni. Emiatt a több szóból álló paramétereket idézőjelek (aposztrófok vagy macskakörmök) közé kell tenni. <parancs> --help Bármelyik parancs után írva kiad nekünk a terminál egy kis segítséget az adott parancs használatáról, például kiírja az általános alakját, és röviden ismerteti a kapcsolóit. man [kapcsoló] <parancs> A megadott parancs hivatalos dokumentációját hozza be. Általában részletesebb a --help kapcsolónál, viszont nem mindig naprakész. help [parancs] Paraméter nélkül kilistázza a - help utasítás részéről - súgóval rendelkező beépített utasítások általános alakját. Egyébként a megadott parancs használatáról ad egy kis eligazítást. Messze nem teljes a támogatott parancsok listája, ráadásul általában nem szolgáltat elegendő információt. <parancs> --version Bármelyik parancs után írva (kevés kivétellel) az adott parancs telepített verziószámát, megjelenése évét és szerzőjét írja ki. Ezzel a módszerrel arról is meggyőződhetünk, hogy telepítve van-e a kérdéses parancs. Ha nincs, akkor \\"command not found\\", azaz \\"parancs nem található\\" hibaüzenetet kapunk. UNIX fájlrendszerek pwd (print working directory) Aktuális könyvtár (munkakönyvtár) elérési útvonala. Eredményként megkapjuk, pontosan \\"hol\\" is vagyunk. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab pwd /home/karaigabor/downloads/matlab cd [könyvtár] (change directory) A fájlrendszerben való mozgást teszi lehetővé. Paraméterként a megcélzott könyvtár nevét kell megadni vagy abszolút, vagy relatív elérési útvonal használatával. Abszolút elérési útvonal megadásánál a keresett könyvtár teljes elérési útvonalát kell megadni a gyökérkönyvtártól kezdve. Pl.: /home/hxxxxxx/mappa/file1 Relatív címzés esetén azt mondjuk csak meg, hogy az aktuális könyvtárhoz képest hol helyezkedik el a megcélzott könyvtár. Tehát aktuális könyvtárból indulva, ha éppen a /home/hxxxxxx-ben vagyunk: ./mappa/file1 . Aktuális könyvtár: . Szülőkönyvtár: .. Példa abszolút címzésre: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cd /home/karaigabor/downloads/matlab karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab Relatív címzés: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cd downloads/matlab karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab Visszalépés a szülő könyvtárba: karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab cd .. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads cd .. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ vagy karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab cd ../.. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ A cd parancs önmagában a felhasználó saját home könyvtárába irányít. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab cd karaigabor@karaigabor:~ '~': a home könyvtár elérési útvonalát tárolja. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab cd ~ karaigabor@karaigabor:~ basename [kapcsolók] <útvonal> Kiírja a megadott útvonalban található könyvtárbejegyzés nevét szülőkönyvtárak nélkül, vagyis az utolsó, '/' utáni nemüres részt.

Használatakor nem szükséges megadni a -a kapcsolót több útvonal feldolgozásához. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ basename -s .txt /egy/ketto/harom.txt negy/ot.jpg hat/ het.mkv harom ot.jpg hat het.mkv karaigabor@karaigabor:~ basename -s t /egy/ketto/harom.txt negy/ot.jpg hat/ het.mkv harom.tx ot.jpg hat het.mkv dirname <útvonal> Kiírja a megadott útvonalból a könyvtárbejegyzés nevét megelőző részt, vagyis a szülőkönyvtárát. Ez általában az utolsó, '/' utáni nemüres rész levágását jelenti. Ha az útvonalban nem szerepel '/', a kimenet '.', míg a gyökérkönyvtárra önmagát adja kimenetként. Itt sem szükséges létező könyvtárbejegyzésre mutatnia a megadott útvonalnak. Csak paraméterben tud inputot fogadni, standard inputon nem! A basename paranccsal ellentétben kapcsoló nélkül is tetszőlegesen sok útvonal feldolgozására képes egyetlen futtatás alkalmával. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ dirname /egy/ketto/ XD.csv / alkonyvtar/al-alkonyvtar a/b/c/d.xml /egy . / alkonyvtar a/b/c ls [kapcsolók] [könyvtár] (list) Kilistázza a megadott könyvtárban található könyvtárbejegyzéseket. A könyvtár megadása nélkül az aktuális könyvtár (munkakönyvtár) tartalmát írja ki. Alapértelmezés szerint ábécé sorrendben sorolja fel a neveket, de alkalmas kapcsolók segítségével más sorrendet és formátumot is előírhatunk. Kiírja a \\"matlab\\" könyvtár tartalmát. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab ls Kiírja a gyökérkönyvtár tartalmát. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/downloads/matlab ls / Néhány kapcsoló: -1: Soronként egyetlen bejegyzés neve szerepel. -a: A rejtett - azaz '.' karakterrel kezdődő - könyvtárbejegyzéseket is kilistázza. -A: A rejtett könyvtárbejegyzéseket is kilistázza a \\".\\" és \\"..\\" kivételével. -l: Oszlopokban, részletesen mutatja a bejegyzések adatait. -g: Mint a -l, de kihagyja a tulajdonost. -o: Mint a -l, de kihagyja a csoportnevet. -h: Olvashatóbb formában írja ki a méretadatokat (pl. K -> kilobájt, M -> megabájt) -S: Fájlméret szerint listáz, méghozzá csökkenő sorrendben. -X: Kiterjesztés szerint listáz. -R: Az alkönyvtárakat rekurzívan bejárja. -r: Fordított sorrendben listáz. Megjegyzés: a kapcsolókat lehet kombinálva is használni. Mindkét alábbi esetben kilistázza részletes adatokkal (-l) a rejtett könyvtárbejegyzésekkel együtt (-A), méghozzá ábécé szerint csökkenő sorrendben (-r). karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls -l -a -r karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls -lar find [útvonal] [kapcsolók] (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve, elegendő az ls parancs ismerete!) Könyvtárbejegyzéseket keres a megadott útvonalból kiindulva. Ha nem adunk meg útvonalat, az aktuális könyvtárból indítja a keresést. Rengeteg kapcsolóval rendelkezik, emellett operátorokat is használhatunk vele. Alapértelmezetten a rejtett állományokat is kilistázza, és az alkönyvtárakat is bejárja. Részletesebben lásd: man find. Néhány kapcsoló: -name <minta>: Szűrés név alapján. Csak a <minta>-ra illeszkedő névvel ellátott bejegyzéseket listázza ki. -path <minta>: Szűrés útvonal alapján. Csak a <minta>-ra illeszkedő útvonallal rendelkező bejegyzéseket listázza ki. -regex <regex>: Szűrés név alapján reguláris kifejezéssel. -type <típus_azonosító>: Szűrés könyvtárbejegyzések típusa alapján. A <típus_azonosító> lehetséges értékei közül a legfontosabbak: d: könyvtár, f: közönséges fájl (vagyis szabályos állomány), l: szimbólikus link -size <[+-]méret>: Szűrés méret alapján. Alapértelmezetten csak a megadott méretű bejegyzéseket listázza ki. A '+' és '-' karakterekkel a megadottnál rendre nagyobb és kisebb bejegyzésekre szűr. -atime <[+-]szám>: Szűrés utolsó módosítás ideje alapján. Csak a pontosan <szám> nappal (<szám>*24 órával) ezelőtt módosított bejegyzéseket listázza ki. A '+' és '-' karakterekkel rendre \\"több mint\\" és \\"kevesebb mint\\" <szám> nappal korábban módosított bejegyzésekre szűr. -mindepth <szám>: A kiindulási ponttól számítva legalább <szám> mélységben keres. -maxdepth <szám>: A kiindulási ponttól számítva legfeljebb <szám> mélységben keres. Ha ez az érték 1, nem keres az alkönyvtárakban. Összes alkönyvtár listázása az aktuális mappából kiindulva. karaigabor@karaigabor:/ find -type d A 240 bájtnál kisebb méretű fájlok listázása a felhasználó home könyvtárából. karaigabor@karaigabor:/ find ~ -maxdepth 1 -type f -size -240c A /etc mappától számítva legalább 4 szinttel lejjebb található, legalább 2 nappal (48 órával) ezelőtt módosított fájlok listázása. karaigabor@karaigabor:/ find /etc -mindepth 4 -type f -atime +1 Megjegyzések: A felsorolt bejegyzéseknek nem csak a nevét, hanem a relatív vagy abszolút útvonalát is kiírja. Alkönyvtárak listázásakor a kiindulási könyvtárat is kiadja, méghozzá első elemként. Ez kiszűrhető például a -mindepth 1 feltétellel. A globális szűrési beállításokat (mint a -mindepth és a -maxdepth, lásd man find) kell először megadni, különben figyelmeztető üzenetetet kapunk. Folyamatok leállítása ^C A Ctrl+c billentyűparanccsal leállíthatunk előtérben futó folyamatokat. Átirányítások cat <fájl> Paraméter nélkül írhatunk a képernyőre, és Enter leütése után kiírja az addig beírt sort. Fájl paraméter esetén kiírja a fájl tartalmát a képernyőre. Ha a cat > szövegfájl kombinációt használjuk, akkor a konzolra írt sorokat a szövegfájlba menti, ha >>-t írunk > helyett, akkor pedig a sorokat hozzáfűzi a fájl végéhez. Például: Kiíratjuk a \\"hello\\" szöveget. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat hello hello ^C A file.txt-be írjuk a \\"first\\" sort. Ha már létezett, a korábbi tartalma elvész. Ellenőrzésképpen ki is íratjuk a képernyőre a file.txt tartalmát. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat > file.txt first ^C karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat file.txt first Hozzáfűzzük ugyanehhez a fájlhoz a \\"second\\" sort, s a frissített tartalmat íratjuk ki. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat >> file.txt second ^C karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat file.txt first second parancs > szövegfájl A parancs kimenete a standard kimenet (terminál) helyett a szövegfájlba fog íródni, a fájl korábbi tartalma elvész. Példa: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls -l > file.txt karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat file.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 83 aug 9 21:01 file2.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 0 aug 13 19:10 file.txt drwxr-xrwx 2 karaigabor karaigabor 4096 aug 9 15:07 hello -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 15796 aug 13 19:09 progalap_linux A standard bemenet- (stdin), kimenet- (stdout) és hibacsatornára (stderr) is lehet hivatkozni, rendre a 0, 1 és 2 számokkal. Az stderr-t ugyanoda irányítjuk, ahová a stdout irányítva lett: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ 2>&1 /dev/null (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!) Egy speciális fájl, amely minden beleírt adatot töröl, miközben az írási művelet sikeres. Az eszközből való olvasás nem ad vissza semmilyen adatot. Felfogható adatnyelő eszközként, mint egy fekete lyuk. A null eszközt tipikusan folyamatok kimeneti stream-jeinek eltüntetésére használják, vagy az üres bemenet biztosítására, általában átirányítás segítségével. Ha létezik egy KaraiGabor futtatható állomány, annak kimenetét ily módon elrejthetjük. karaigabor@karaigabor:~/OpenGL ./KaraiGabor > /dev/null A standard kimenetet állítsuk a \\"semmire\\". Ha a standard kimenet eddig a képernyőre volt állítva, akkor most nem fogunk kiíratáskor látni semmit: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ 1>/dev/null parancs >> szövegfájl A parancs kimenete a standard kimenet (konzol) helyett a szövegfájl végéhez fog hozzáfűződni. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls -1 >> file.txt karaigabor@karaigabor:~ cat file.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 83 aug 9 21:01 file2.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 0 aug 13 19:10 file.txt drwxr-xrwx 2 karaigabor karaigabor 4096 aug 9 15:07 hello -rw-r--r-- 1 karaigabor karaigabor 15796 aug 13 19:09 progalap_linux file2.txt file.txt hello progalap_linux parancs < szövegfájl (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!) A parancs bemeneteként kapja a szövegfájl tartalmát. Például a cat < file.txt egyenértékű a cat file.txt paranccsal. Sokféle parancs/blokk számára lehet ily módon bemenetetet szolgáltatni (például anonim függvényeknek), ám ezeket jelen kurzuson nem tárgyaljuk. Parancsok láncolása Parancsok kombinálására, szabályozott végrehajtásukra több lehetőségünk is van megfelelő operátorok használatával. Néhány példa: \\"És\\" (&) operátor A parancs után írva - szóközzel elválasztva - az adott parancs futtatása a háttérben fog történni. Így például forráskódszerkesztő program indítása esetén nem foglalja le a promptot az alkalmazás bezárásáig. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ gedit file2.txt proba.sh & [1] 1745 karaigabor@karaigabor:~ notepad++ file.txt hello.awk AWK.xml & [2] 1748 Szögletes zárójelek között a felhasználó által háttérben indított folyamatok száma íródik ki, a mellette lévő szám pedig a folyamat (processzus) azonosítója. Ezeket a ps paranccsal listázhatjuk ki. Pontosvessző (;) operátor Általános alak: parancs_1; parancs_2; … parancs_k; A parancsok pontosvesszővel elválasztva egymás után hajtódnak végre balról jobbra. Az alábbi példában létrehozunk egy új könyvtárat \\"ujmappa\\" néven, amelybe ezután belenavigálunk, végül kilistázzuk a tartalmát. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ mkdir ujmappa; cd ujmappa; ls -l; összesen 0 karaigabor@karaigabor:~/ujmappa Negálás (!) operátor A C nyelvhez hasonlóan BASH-ben is használható aritmetikai és logikai kifejezések tagadására, ám ezen túl szűrési feltételeknél is bevethető. Az összes nem rejtett fájl kilistázása az aktuális könyvtárból. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ find -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name '.*' Escape () operátor parancs tördelésére Ha a parancs szövege túl hosszú, emiatt nem férne ki egy sorba, olvashatóbb tördelésre a '' operátort használhatjuk. Enter leütése után az előző sorban megkezdett parancs szövegét folytathatjuk. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ find -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 5 > -type f -name \\"*fajl*.txt\\" A fenti parancs az alábbival egyenértékű: karaigabor@karaigabor:~ find -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 5 -type f -name \\"*fajl*.txt\\" Operátorként funkcionáló karakterek speciális jelentésének elvételére is használható, így a karakter egy tényleges példánya kerül beillesztésre. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ echo szöveg(1) szövegn szöveg(1) szövegn A láncolásra szolgáló operátorok teljes listája itt érhető el angol nyelven. Közülük a csővezetékkel fogunk a legtöbbet foglalkozni, ZH-n az lesz számonkérve. L2 L2 Fájlműveletek (1. rész) touch <fájl> Új, tetszőleges kiterjesztésű fájlt létrehozhatunk vele. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls karaigabor@karaigabor:~ touch vmi.txt akarmi karaigabor@karaigabor:~ ls akarmi vmi.txt Megjegyzés: A fő funkciója létező fájlok utolsó hozzáférési/módosítási időpontjának megváltoztatása. Szöveg kiíratása echo [szöveg lista] Az utána lévő - szóközzel elválasztott - szövegeket írja ki a képernyőre. Ha az egész szöveget idézőjelek - azaz aposztrófok (') vagy macskakörmök (\\") közé tesszük, akkor azt egyetlen paraméterként értelmezi. Kapcsolók: -n: Nem dob új sort a kiíratás után. -e: Értelmezi az escape szekvenciákat (n, t, …). Használatuk esetén mindenképpen idézőjelek közé kell tenni a kiírandó szöveget. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ echo Hello Kitty! Hello Kitty! karaigabor@karaigabor:~ echo 'HellotKitty!' HellotKitty! karaigabor@karaigabor:~ echo -e 'HellotKitty!' Hello Kitty! Konstans szövegeket - vagyis a sztring literálokat - általában nem szükséges idézőjelek közé tenni, mert a BASH alapértelmezetten úgy kezeli őket. Aposztrófok között is konstans szöveget feltételez a BASH, azonban a macskakörömnek változók kezelésekor fontos szerepe van, amit a B1 anyagrészben tárgyalunk. printf <formátumsztring> [paraméter lista] (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve, elegendő az echo parancs ismerete!) Formázott szöveg kiíratására szolgál ugyanúgy, mint C nyelvben. Az echo parancshoz képest sokkal több formázási módot támogat. A helyes működéshez a formátumsztringet idézőjelek közé kell tenni, ami lehet macskaköröm (\\" \\") vagy aposztróf (' ') is. karaigabor@karaigabor:~ printf \\"132 hexadecimálisan: %xn\\" 132 132 hexadecimálisan: 84 Néhány dologban eltér a használata a C-ben megismert változathoz képest.

Például ?lma lehet alma vagy álma is - többek között. *: Bármennyi (akár 0) karaktert helyettesít. Például *gép lehet gép, mosógép, számítógép, stb. [HALMAZ]: A felsorolt karakterekből pontosan egyet helyettesít. Például [aó]lom lehet ólom vagy alom, fajl[034] pedig fajl0, fajl3 vagy fajl4. [^HALMAZ]: Pontosan egy karaktert helyettesít a halmazban NEM szereplő karakterek közül. [TÓL-IG]: Pontosan egy karaktert helyettesít a tartomány által lefedett karakterek közül. A TÓL-IG kifejezés a TÓL és IG (ASCII) karakterkódja közötti karakterkódú betűket/szimbólumokat helyettesíti be, ahogy a tr parancsnál is.

Szintaxisa pedig: 1. verzió: chmod [ugoa][+-][rwx] fájlnév Az [ugoa] kapcsolókkal írjuk elő, hogy kinek adjuk a jogot. Adhatunk jogokat a tulajdonosnak (u - user), a tulajdonos csoportjának (g - group), másoknak (o - others) vagy pedig mindenkinek egyszerre (a - all). A [+-] azt jelenti, hogy adjuk (+) vagy elvesszük (-) a jogokat.

A futtatást és paraméterezést a progalapon is már megszokott módon fogjuk megejteni. ./fájlnév.sh [param1 param2 …] Előbbi parancs az alábbi utasítással ekvivalens: bash fájlnév.sh [param1 param2 …] Fejléc: She-bang/Hash-bang A szkriptet interpretáló program abszolút elérési útvonalát tartalmazza, méghozzá a \\"#!\\" sztringet követően. Mivel Bash szkripteket írunk, a Bash program elérési útvonalát kell megadnunk, amely rögzített. #!/bin/bash Közvetlenül a \\"#!\\" után opcionálisan szerepelhetnek elválasztó karakterek (szóköz, vízszintes tabulátor), de az elérési útvonalban NEM! Megjegyzés Egysoros: amennyiben nem határolójelek között van, a '#' után írt karaktereket az aktuális sorban figyelmen kívül hagyja az értelmező. # példa egysoros megjegyzésre Többsoros: a ':' utasítás minden paraméterét átugorja, ezáltal egy utána írt, több sorba tördelt sztringgel oldható meg. : ' példa többsoros megjegyzésre ' Változók Használat BASH-ben a változók neve nem kezdődhet számmal. A kis- és nagybetűk különbözőnek számítanak változóneveknél is. A változóérték behelyettesítésekor a változónév elé egy karaktert írunk. Sztringek összefűzésekor - amennyiben közvetlenül a kifejezés után betű, számjegy vagy aláhúzásjel áll - { és } karakterek közé kell tennünk a változónevet, mert így tudja az értelmező megkülönböztetni a változónevet a sztring literáltól. Nagyon fontos, hogy értékadáskor NEM lehet helyköz az egyenlőségjel bal és jobb oldalán sem! #!/bin/bash val1=\\"kecske\\" val2=\\"sajt\\" echo val1 echo val1val2 echo val1{val2}os A kiírott szöveg: kecske kecskesajt kecskesajtos Sztring műveletek A {NÉV} alak nem csak összefűzésre használható, ugyanis számos változóművelet ebből a formátumból indul ki. Ezek közül tekintünk át néhányat, a teljes lista ezen a linken található. {#NÉV}: A NÉV változó értékének hosszát adja vissza karakterekben számolva. {NÉV:index}: A NÉV változó értékének index. karakterétől kezdődő részsztringjét adja vissza. A karakterek indexelése 0-tól kezdődik! Ha index negatív (legyen -k), akkor az utolsó k darab karakterét adja eredményül. Ekkor elé - vagyis a ':' után - tenni kell egy szóközt a helyes működés érdekében! {NÉV:index:hossz}: Hasonló a {NÉV:index} művelethez, de legfeljebb hossz darab karakterből álló részsztringet ad vissza. index és hossz aritmetikai kifejezés is lehet. {!NÉV}: Indirekció. A NÉV változó értékét változónévnek tekinti, s annak értékét adja eredményül. {NÉV#minta} (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!): Ha a minta illeszkedik a NÉV változó értékének elejére, akkor levágásra kerül a legrövidebb illeszkedő rész. {NÉVminta} (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!): Ha a minta illeszkedik a NÉV változó értékének elejére, akkor levágásra kerül a leghosszabb illeszkedő rész. {NÉV%minta} (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!): Ha a minta illeszkedik a NÉV változó értékének végére, akkor levágásra kerül a legrövidebb illeszkedő rész. {NÉV%%minta} (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!): Ha a minta illeszkedik a NÉV változó értékének végére, akkor levágásra kerül a leghosszabb illeszkedő rész. #!/bin/bash val=\\"sör.TXT.txt\\" echo \\"Szöveg:\\" val echo \\"Szöveg hossza:\\" {#val} echo \\"2.-5. karakterek:\\" {val:1:4} echo \\"Utolsó 5 karakter:\\" {val: -5} echo \\" Első '.' előtti rész levágva:\\" {val#*.} echo \\"Utolsó '.' előtti rész levágva:\\" {val*.} echo \\"Utolsó '.' utáni rész levágva:\\" {val%.*} echo \\" Első '.' utáni rész levágva:\\" {val%%.*} A kiírott szöveg: Szöveg: sör.TXT.txt Szöveg hossza: 11 2.-5. karakterek: ör.T Utolsó 5 karakter: T.txt Első '.' előtti rész levágva: TXT.txt Utolsó '.' előtti rész levágva: txt Utolsó '.' utáni rész levágva: sör.TXT Első '.' utáni rész levágva: sör Vegyük észre, hogy a {NÉV%.*} művelet fájlnevek kiterjesztésének levágására akkor is használható, ha több '.' szerepel bennük. Környezeti változók (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!) A futtatókörnyezet testreszabását teszik lehetővé, továbbá hasznos metaadatokat kérdezhetünk le velük a hatékonyabb programozás/automatizálás érdekében. Kevés kivétellel mindig nagybetűs nevük van. A BASH környezeti változók teljes listája megtalálható ezen az oldalon. PWD: Az aktuális könyvtár (azaz munkakönyvtár) elérési útvonalát tárolja, amit a pwd paranccsal is lekérdezhetünk. HOME: Az aktuális felhasználó home könyvtárának abszolút elérési útvonalát tárolja, amit a '~' hivatkozással is elérhetünk. PATH: A keresési könyvtárak elérési útvonalát tárolja egymástól ':' karakterrel elválastva. Itt keresi a parancsokat a shell. SHELL: A shell értelmező program abszolút elérési útvonalát tárolja, amely kezeli a terminálban kiadott parancsokat. BASH: A BASH értelmező abszolút elérési útvonalát tárolja. Ha a SHELL változóban is ez szerepel, akkor a BASH az aktuális értelmező. BASH_VERSION: A BASH értelmező aktuálisan telepített verzióját tárolja a bash --version parancshoz képest tömörebb módon. IFS: A mezőelválasztó karaktereket tartalmazza egyetlen karakterláncként. Ezek alapértelmezetten a szóköz, vízszintes tabulátor és sortörés. Számít a sorrend! SECONDS: A shell (terminál) indítása óta eltelt másodpercek számát adja vissza. RANDOM: Egy 15-bites, előjel nélküli véletlen egész számot (0 – 32767) ad vissza. SRANDOM: Egy 32-bites, előjel nélküli véletlen egész számot (0 – 4294967295) ad vissza. A BASH 5.1-es verziójától kezdődően érhető el. Érték beolvasása (ZH-n nem lesz számonkérve!) read változó A standard bemenetről tetszőleges változóba be tudunk olvasni egy sornyi szöveget. #!/bin/bash read VAL echo VAL Beágyazott utasítás Legtöbbször arra használjuk, hogy programkódon belül egy parancs vagy csővezeték kimenetét változónak adjuk értékül későbbi felhasználásra. Az alábbi két lehetőségünk van rá, a két szintaxis egyenértékű: (utasítás) \`utasítás\` # (AltGr+7) Macskakörmök között megadva is végrehajtódnak, s behelyettesítésre kerül a kimenetük, azonban aposztrófok esetében már nem. Az alábbi utasítások eredményeképpen val1 és val2 értéke is \\"'Bela' nagybetűsítve: BELA\\" lesz. #!/bin/bash val1=\\"'Bela' nagybetűsítve: (echo 'Bela' | tr a-z A-Z)\\" val2=\\"'Bela' nagybetűsítve: \`echo 'Bela' | tr a-z A-Z\`\\" Parancssori paraméterek Segítségükkel legtöbbször inputot adunk át a program számára. Néhány gyakran használt, paraméterekkel kapcsolatos beépített változó: #: A parancssori paraméterek darabszáma. n: Az n. parancssori paraméter értéke. (1 az első, 2 a második, …) 0: Az aktuális program neve, vagyis a futtatáskor kiadott parancs első szava. *: Valamennyi parancssori paraméter egyben, egyetlen karakterláncként (\\"1 2 … 9 …\\"). Az egyes paraméterek az IFS változóban tárolt szöveg első karakterével vannak elválasztva, mely alapértelmezetten a szóköz. @: hasonló a *-hoz, viszont külön sztringekben tárolja a parancssori paramétereket. Ha idézőjelek között használjuk (\\"@\\"), akkor a szóközöket tartalmazó paraméterek kezelésére is képes. Aritmetikai operátorok Segítségükkel matematikai műveleteket hajthatunk végre numerikus változókon és konstansokon. Részletesebb magyarázat az online dokumentációban olvasható. Inkrementálás és dekrementálás operátorok: ++, -- Rendre 1-gyel növeli és csökkenti a változó értékét. Mindkét művelet prefix (pl. ++x) és postfix (pl. x--) alakban is használható, ahogy C-ben. Elemi kétoperandusú operátorok: +, -, *, /, %, ** A '/' egész osztást jelent, az eredményből a törtrész mindig levágásra kerül. Hatványozásra kizárólag a '**' használható, '^' a bitenkénti kizáró vagy műveletre való. Megjegyzés: '+' és '-' számok előjelének megadására is használatos. Értékadás operátorok: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= Az eredményt az első operandusban tárolják el. Például az x+=y művelet x értékét y-nal növeli. Vegyük észre, hogy a hatványozás+felülírás - azaz '**=' - operátor NINCS definiálva. Aritmetikai kifejezések A BASH alapértelmezetten minden értéket szövegként kezel, emiatt külön jelölnünk kell a numerikus műveleteket. Az alábbi 3 lehetőség közül bármelyiket alkalmazhatjuk: ((KIF)) vagy ((KIF)) A legrugalmasabb szintaxissal rendelkező módszer. A zárójelpáron belül nem érzékeny a szóközökre, és nem kötelező kitenni a '' jelet a változónevek elé. val=-6 szam=((val * 7)) ((val *= 2)) # Változó értékének frissítése esetén a nyitó zárójel előtt is elhagyható a ''. let KIF Az értékadás művelet elé helyezett let kulcsszón kívül teljesen változatlan a kifejezés szerkezete. val=5 let szam=val*-3 # A negatív előjel a szorzás előtt értékelődik ki. expr KIF A kifejezés elemeit - operandusok, operátor - parancssori paraméterben átadva elvégzi a műveletet, és az eredményt a standard kimeneten adja vissza. Részletesebben lásd: expr --help. val=-3 szam=(expr val * 13) # A '*' operátort escape-elni kell! Feladatok 1.

B2 B2 Feltételes kifejezések, logikai operátorok Shell programozási nyelvekben a numerikus és szöveges összehasonlításokon kívül a fájlrendszerben található könyvtárbejegyzésekről kérhetünk le információkat. Az operátorok teljes listája ezen a linken található. Szám_1 -eq Szám_2 - - - Egyenlő # equal (A == operátor is használható.) Szám_1 -ne Szám_2 - - - Nem egyenlő # not equal (A != operátor is használható.) Szám_1 -lt Szám_2 - - - Kisebb # less than (A < operátor is használható.) Szám_1 -le Szám_2 - - - Kisebb vagy egyenlő # less or equal (A <= operátor is használható.) Szám_1 -gt Szám_2 - - - Nagyobb # greater than (A > operátor is használható.) Szám_1 -ge Szám_2 - - - Nagyobb vagy egyenlő # greather or equal (A >= operátor is használható.) Kif_1 && Kif_2 - - - - - Logikai ÉS # and (A -a kapcsoló is használható, leginkább a test parancsnál.)

Feltételes kifejezések kiértékelésének egyik módja a test parancs vagy a vele ekvivalens (szokatlan elnevezésű) '[' parancs. Utóbbi esetben ']' a kötelező utolsó argumentum. A kiértékelés önmagában nem eredményez kiíratást, viszont a parancs visszatérési értéke (0 -> igaz; 1 -> hamis) eltárolásra kerül a ? környezeti változóban. Ez a parancs a következő operátorokat nem támogatja: <, <=, >, >=, =~. Megjegyzés: ? értéke bármely parancs végrehajtása után frissül, így mindig a legutóbb futtatott parancs \\"sikerességéről\\" szolgáltat információt. # Kiértékeli a feltételt, és 0-ra (igaz) vagy 1-re (hamis) állítja a ? környezeti változó értékét. test feltétel VAGY [ feltétel ] Összetett feltételt a -a és -o kapcsolókkal írhatunk, vagy a &&, || operátorokkal láncolhatjuk össze a kiértékelő parancsokat. test feltétel1 (-a | -o) feltétel2 ... test feltétel1 (&& | ||) test feltétel2 ... VAGY [ feltétel1 (-a | -o) feltétel2 ] ... [ feltétel1 ] (&& | ||) [ feltétel2 ] ... Általában a logikai feltételeket bizonyos utasítások végrehajtásának eldöntésére használjuk. A test (és '[') parancs esetében ez is a && és || operátor segítségével tehető meg. Ha valamelyik utasításblokk több parancsból áll, a csoportosítás érdekében { és } közé kell helyezni őket. # A két utasításblokk bármelyike elhagyható. test feltétel && igaz_utasításblokk || hamis_utasításblokk VAGY [ feltétel ] && igaz_utasításblokk || hamis_utasításblokk Példák: #!/bin/bash # Ellenőrzi, hogy a megadott útvonalak ugyanoda mutatnak-e, vagyis az egyik linkel-e a másikra.

Feltételes kifejezések kiértékelésére az alábbi három zárójel típus használható. [ ] -> szögletes zárójel Bár a '[' nyitó zárójel önálló parancsként is értelmezett, ugyanazzal a szintaxissal vezérlési szerkezetekben is használható. Támogatja a kapcsolókat (-eq, -lt, -z, -e, …) és a sztringek összehasonlítását (=, !=). Nem támogatja a <, <=, >, >= relációs operátorokat és a regexre illesztést (=~). (( )) -> dupla kerek zárójel Feltételes kifejezésekben is az aritmetikai (numerikus) műveleteket teszi lehetővé. Nem érzékeny a szóközökre, és nem kötelező kitenni a '' jelet a változónevek elé. Támogatja a ==, !=, <=, >=, <, > relációs és az aritmetikai (+, -, …) operátorokat. Nem támogatja a kapcsolókat, sztringek összehasonlítását és a regexre illesztést. [[ ]] -> dupla szögletes zárójel A legszélesebb funkcionalitással rendelkező típus, mivel a legtöbb operátort támogatja. Egy remek összehasonlítás az egyszeres zárójelpárral ezen a linken olvasható. Támogatja a kapcsolókat (kivéve -a és -o) és a sztringek összehasonlítását. Sztringek egyezésén (=, !=) kívül a lexikografikus összehasonlítást is lehetővé teszi a < és > operátorokkal. Támogatja a =~ operátort. Nem támogatja a <= és >= operátorokat. Vezérlési szerkezetek if utasítás A szelekciós vezérlést (elágazást) valósítja meg számos más programozási nyelvhez hasonlóan. A behúzás/indentálás tetszőleges mértékű lehet. if feltétel; then utasításblokk elif feltétel; then # Elhagyható rész. utasításblokk else # Szintén elhagyható rész. utasításblokk fi #!/bin/bash if [[ 1 -lt 9 ]]; then echo \\"A paraméter 9-nél kisebb.\\" fi #!/bin/bash v1=\\"Bela\\" v2=\\"Jeno\\" if [[ v1 != v2 ]]; then echo \\"A két sztring nem egyezik meg.\\" # Ez fog végrehajtódni. else echo \\"A két sztring megegyezik.\\" fi #!/bin/bash if [[ # -eq 1 ]] && [[ 1 -ge 1 ]] && [[ 1 -le 10 ]]; then echo \\"A parancssori paraméter értéke 1 és 10 között van.\\" fi # Ugyanez másképpen if ((# == 1 && 1 >= 1 && 1 <= 10)); then echo \\"A parancssori paraméter értéke 1 és 10 között van.\\" fi #!/bin/bash if [[ ! -e 1 ]]; then echo \\"A(z) 1 útvonalon nem található semmiféle könyvtárbejegyzés.\\" fi #!/bin/bash v=\\"\\" if [[ -n v ]]; then # A -n kapcsoló elhagyható echo \\"A változó nem üres.\\" fi #!/bin/bash n1=6 n2=42 if (( n1 < n2 )); then echo \\"6 kisebb, mint 42.\\" # Ez fog végrehajtódni. else echo \\"6 NEM kisebb, mint 42.\\" fi # Ügyeljünk arra, hogy a < és > operátor lexikografikus összehasonlítást végez szögletes dupla zárójelpár között! if [[ n1 < n2 ]]; then echo \\"6 lexikografikusan kisebb, mint 42.\\" else echo \\"6 lexikografikusan NEM kisebb, mint 42.\\" # Ez fog végrehajtódni. fi for - lista alapú # A változó rendre felveszi a lista elemeinek értékét, és minden értékkel végrehajtódik az utasítás blokk. for valtozo in lista; do utasításblokk done VAGY # Az n-től m-ig tartó (egész) számtartomány elemein megy végig. n és m is csak konstans egész lehet! for i in {n..m}; do utasításblokk done Előbbi esetben a lista lehet: szavak szóközökkel elválasztva, mintaillesztéssel megadott könyvtárbejegyzések (pl. *), változók szóközökkel elválasztva (pl. a b c), vagy (…) vagy \`…\` szerkezettel megadott beágyazott utasítás kimenete. # Kiírja a hét napjait. for nap in hétfő kedd szerda csütörtök péntek szombat vasárnap; do echo nap done # Kiírja a kapott parancssori paramétereket, méghozzá felsorolási sorrendben. for param in *; do echo param done # Kilistázza az aktuális könyvtárban található összes txt kiterjesztésű állományt. for fajl in (ls *.txt); do echo fajl done for - index alapú A C nyelvben megismert indexelős for ciklus.

From the moment it starts, listeners are transported across the cosmos, enveloped in a soundscape that is both vast and intimately connected to the very essence of creation and destruction that Aurelion Sol represents. The score begins with a deep, resonant hum, evoking the vast emptiness and the mysterious depths of space. This base layer sets a foundation that feels both timeless and ancient, hinting at Aurelion Sol's eternal existence. Over this, a slow build-up of orchestral strings swells, introducing a sense of majesty and grandeur. The strings stretch out wide, like the expansive reach of the universe, their melodies flowing and cascading in waves that suggest the constant movement and dynamism of celestial bodies. As the theme progresses, a choir joins, their voices ethereal and otherworldly. The blending of human voices with the orchestral backdrop elevates the piece to a transcendent level, symbolizing Aurelion Sol's creation and manipulation of stars. The choir's harmonies are complex and layered, reminiscent of the interconnectedness of all things within the cosmos. Punctuating the orchestral and choral elements are moments of powerful brass, which surge like the birth of new stars, explosive and brilliant. These bursts represent Aurelion Sol's immense power and his ability to forge and destroy with a mere thought or flick of his tail. The brass sections are bold and commanding, demanding attention and reverence for the cosmic dragon's might. Interwoven with the larger orchestral and choral components are delicate, twinkling sounds that mimic the sparkle of stars and the ethereal beauty of the night sky. These elements add a touch of magic and wonder, reflecting the awe-inspiring nature of the cosmos and the role Aurelion Sol plays within it. The culmination of the theme is a grand crescendo, where all elements of the orchestra and choir come together in a harmonious climax, enveloping the listener in the full power and majesty of the Star Forger. As it reaches its peak, the theme then gently recedes, like the ebbing of cosmic waves, leaving behind a sense of peace and a lingering awe at the vastness and beauty of the universe. In essence, Aurelion Sol's theme is a masterful auditory representation of the celestial dragon's dominion over the cosmos, embodying the awe, majesty, and mysterious beauty of the universe in a rich and evocative musical composition."},{"instruction":"create a description how aurelion sol theme sounds","output":"The theme of Aurelion Sol, echoing his cosmic grandeur and astronomical might, is an auditory journey into the heart of the cosmos.

These elements come together to craft a melody that is both awe-inspiring and ominously powerful, reflecting Aurelion Sol's creation and destruction nature. The use of a choir adds a divine layer to the composition, their voices soaring high and echoing the omnipotence of this star forger. Percussive elements subtly introduced mimic the heartbeat of the cosmos, providing a rhythmic undercurrent that symbolizes the ongoing creation and expansion of the universe. The melody, rich with harmonic layers, takes listeners on a journey through nebulae and galaxies, capturing the essence of infinite space and the celestial dragon's command over it. The theme reaches its climax with a triumphant horn section, symbolizing Aurelion Sol's dominion and might, before softly descending into a quieter, reflective passage. This finale brings a sense of wisdom and ancient knowledge, evoking the timelessness of the stars and the dragon's eternal watch over the cosmos.
