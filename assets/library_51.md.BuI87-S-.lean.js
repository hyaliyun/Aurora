The first given equation is: [ frac{sqrt{x}}{sqrt{y}} - frac{sqrt{y}}{sqrt{x}} = frac{7}{12} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{x - y}{sqrt{xy}} = frac{7}{12}  ] 2. Since ( frac{x - y}{sqrt{xy}} = frac{7}{12} ) and we have ( x - y = 7 ), we can substitute ( x - y ) into the equation: [ frac{7}{sqrt{xy}} = frac{7}{12}  ] From this, we solve for ( sqrt{xy} ): [ sqrt{xy} = 12  ] By squaring both sides, we get: [ xy = 144  ] 3. Next, substitute ( y = frac{144}{x} ) into the second given equation ( x - y = 7 ): [ x - frac{144}{x} = 7  ] To eliminate the fraction, multiply through by ( x ): [ x^2 - 144 = 7x  ] Rewrite and rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form: [ x^2 - 7x - 144 = 0  ] 4. Factorize the quadratic equation: [ (x - 16)(x + 9) = 0  ] Thus, we have two possible solutions for ( x ): [ x = 16 quad text{or} quad x = -9  ] Since ( x ) and ( y ) are non-zero real numbers and must be positive (from the context of the initial conditions involving square roots), we reject ( x = -9 ). Hence, we have: [ x = 16  ] 5. Solve for ( y ) using the relation ( xy = 144 ): [ y = frac{144}{x} = frac{144}{16} = 9  ] 6. Now, we need to find ( w ) where ( w = x + y ): [ w = 16 + 9 = 25  ] Thus, the value of ( w ) is: [ boxed{25} ]  7.

A navigator can measure the length of the path between any two cities in this network.

Let the vertices of this graph be the cities, and the edges be the roads.  2. **Analyze the Structure of the Graph**:      According to the problem, from any city, exactly one unique path exists to any other city. This implies that the graph does not contain any cycles (since a cycle would provide more than one path between cities, violating the problem's condition).     Therefore, G must be a tree. A tree is defined as a connected acyclic graph. 3. **Connectedness**:      We are guaranteed that the graph is connected because there exists a path between any two cities. This is a defining property of a tree. 4. **Proof of Acyclic Nature**:     Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a cycle in the graph. This would mean there is at least one path between two vertices that forms a loop. However, the problem states that there is only a unique way to travel between any two cities, thus cycles cannot exist. This confirms that G is acyclic and hence a tree. 5. **Leaf Nodes Analysis**:    In a tree, removing any edge makes the graph into exactly two separate connected components. Moreover, any end vertex of each edge implies it must be a city (terminal point). According to the problem, all dead-end branches (leaf nodes) end in cities. Trees have the property that there is at least one leaf node. 6. **Navigation-Based Distance Measurement**:     Start by choosing any leaf city and measure the distance to the next closest city along the path. This is because we're dealing with an acyclic structure (tree), and from leaf nodes (end vertices), farthest connections would provide a comprehensive span of the graph. 7. **Operationalizing Distance Measures**:    Measure the distance between one leaf city and another progressively. Go through the pairs {(A_1, A_2), (A_2, A_3), ldots, (A_{99}, A_{100})} if it logically adheres to a lined-up connection based on the top tree layout (choosing any pair along with tree layout). 8. **Reconstruction of Total Length**:     After measuring all pairs:         We have sum_{i=1}^{99} d(A_i, A_{i+1}) for each city pair traversed - twice each.         Sum up all measured distances, and divide the total by 2, as each path will be measured twice in opposite directions in a tree. 9. **Conclusion**:     By following 100 measurements along the defined leaf-to-adjacent city pairs, construct the network length and solve by summing and splitting.  text{Total Length of the Network} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{99} 2d(A_i, A_{i+1})}{2}  # Final Answer:  boxed{ text{Yes, it is possible to determine the length of the entire network with only 100 such measurements.} }  This follows the structured approach analyzing tree properties, leveraging acyclic connectivity and ensuring validity via inherent graph-theory principles, resulting in a conclusive determination."},{"instruction":"a summer cottage village where Gavrila spends his holidays, there is a water supply with cold water.

Then, Gavrila opens both faucets equally and measures the resulting temperature. To find the temperature when both faucets are open equally: 1. **Understanding the flow rates and temperature contributions**:     Since the problem states that the flow rate remains the same, we can treat the situation as the mixing of equal parts of hot and cold water. 2. **Apply the principle of heat mixing**:     The temperature of the mixed water when equal volumes are mixed can be calculated using the formula for mixing two substances:     [     T_{text{mixed}} = frac{T_{text{cold}} + T_{text{hot}}}{2}     ]     Here:     [     T_{text{cold}} = 20^{circ} mathrm{C},quad T_{text{hot}} = 40^{circ} mathrm{C}     ] 3. **Calculate the resulting temperature**:     Substituting the given temperatures:     [     T_{text{mixed}} = frac{20^{circ} mathrm{C} + 40^{circ} mathrm{C}}{2} = frac{60^{circ} mathrm{C}}{2} = 30^{circ} mathrm{C}     ] 4. **State the conclusion**: The temperature of the water when both faucets are opened equally and the flow rate is identical would be: [ boxed{30^{circ} mathrm{C}} ] Therefore, the mixed temperature of the water in this scenario is (30^{circ} mathrm{C})."},{"instruction":"A textit{palindrome} is a number that reads the same forward as backward, such as 323 or 1221.

Assume we can partition the integers into subsets (A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots) such that:    [    sum_{a in A_k} a = k + 2020    ]    However, note the following:    - Since (A_k) is composed of positive integers and their sum equals (k + 2020), there are constraints on how these sets can be formed to include all positive integers without overlap. 3. **Evaluating Specific Cases for (k)**:        Let's compute for specific values of (k). For instance:    [    k = 1: sum_{a in A_1} a = 1 + 2020 = 2021    ]    [    k = 2: sum_{a in A_2} a = 2 + 2020 = 2022    ]    Clearly, each subset (A_k) must be composed in such a way that the sum of the elements equals (k + 2020). This formulation would be overly restrictive because subsets like (A_1) and (A_2) might share elements to reach the respective sums, leading to overlaps or missing integers. 4. **Conclusion**:    Through examining the construction and properties of the required subsets, it becomes evident that such partitioning whereby each subset (A_k) has a sum (k + 2020) and all positive integers can be covered without overlap is not feasible. 5. **Examining the Sum (k^{2} + 2020)**:        Similar to the previous analysis, evaluate whether we can partition the integers into subsets (A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots) such that:    [    sum_{a in A_k} a = k^{2} + 2020    ] 6. **Evaluating Specific Cases for (k)**:        Compute for specific values of (k):    [    k = 1: sum_{a in A_1} a = 1^2 + 2020 = 2021    ]    [    k = 2: sum_{a in A_2} a = 2^2 + 2020 = 2024    ]    As seen, (A_1) and (A_2) require sums 2021 and 2024 respectively. The constraints are even more restrictive than in the previous part, and disjoint subsets that meet these sums while including every positive integer exactly once are even less feasible. # Conclusion: Given the analysis in both cases, it is evident that such partitioning is not possible for the sets to satisfy either of the given sum conditions.

The diagonal of the larger cube, which is also the diameter of the inscribed sphere, can be calculated using the formula for the diagonal of a cube, d = asqrt{3}, where a is the edge length of the cube. Thus, for the larger cube, the diagonal (diameter of the sphere) is 2sqrt{3}. 2. However, the solution provided seems to have a minor mistake in the calculation of the diameter of the sphere. It should be calculated as the diagonal of the larger cube, which is 2sqrt{3}, not 2.

However, since there are 12 students with brown eyes, and assuming the maximum overlap between students with brown eyes and those without a lunch box, we subtract the maximum number of students with brown eyes who could potentially not have a lunch box: - Maximum students with brown eyes not having a lunch box = 10 (since this is the total number of students without a lunch box) Therefore, the least number of students who have both brown eyes and a lunch box is calculated by subtracting the maximum number of students with brown eyes who could not have a lunch box from the total number of students with brown eyes: [12 - 10 = 2] Thus, the least possible number of students who have both brown eyes and a lunch box is boxed{2}."},{"instruction":"Given that x > 0, the value of x when x+ frac {81}{x} is minimized is __________ .","output":"To find the value of x that minimizes x+ frac {81}{x}, we consider the inequality for arithmetic and geometric means.

Consider the given statement: a sphere omega passes through the apex S of the pyramid SABC and intersects the edges SA, SB, and SC at points A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} respectively, secondary to S. The sphere Omega, circumscribing the pyramid SABC, intersects with omega along a circle that lies in a plane parallel to the plane ABC. Points A_{2}, B_{2}, and C_{2} are symmetric to points A_{1}, B_{1}, and C_{1} concerning the midpoints of edges SA, SB, and SC respectively.    2. To prove that points A, B, C, A_{2}, B_{2}, and C_{2} lie on the same sphere, we need to show that the equality        SA_{2} cdot SA = SB_{2} cdot SB = SC_{2} cdot SC         holds true because of the equality AA_{1} = SA_{2} and two similar expressions.

The circle of intersection of these spheres lies in a plane perpendicular to l, such that l perp (ABC).

The equality AA_{1} cdot AS = CC_{1} cdot CS can be proven analogously using the same symmetry and rotational argument. # Conclusion: Since AA_{1} cdot AS = BB_{1} cdot BS = CC_{1} cdot CS implies that SA_{2} cdot SA = SB_{2} cdot SB = SC_{2} cdot SC, we can conclude that the points A, B, C, A_{2}, B_{2}, and C_{2} lie on the same sphere. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Find the smallest number that is greater than 1.1 out of the five numbers 1.4, 9/10, 1.2, 0.5, and 13/10.","output":"To find the smallest number greater than 1.1, we first need to convert all the numbers to the same format (decimals) to make it easier to compare them: 1.4 is already in decimal form. 9/10 as a decimal is 0.9. 1.2 is already in decimal form. 0.5 is already in decimal form. 13/10 as a decimal is 1.3.

Find m+n.","output":"To solve the problem step by step, let's start by defining a complex number x that represents a rotation by 1^circ on the complex plane. Specifically, let x = cos 1^circ + i sin 1^circ. This is a fundamental step because it allows us to use complex numbers to represent rotations and angles, which is key in trigonometry. Given this definition, we can express sin 1^circ in terms of x using the identity: [ sin 1^circ = frac{x - frac{1}{x}}{2i} = frac{x^2 - 1}{2ix}. ] Taking the absolute value of both sides, and noting that the magnitude of x is 1 (since it represents a rotation and thus lies on the unit circle), we find: [ |2sin 1^circ| = |x^2 - 1|. ] This step is crucial because it connects the sine function with the complex number x. Now, let's consider the product M = prod_{k=1}^{45} csc^2(2k-1)^circ. Since csc is the reciprocal of sin, and sin z = sin (180^circ - z), we can express the reciprocal of M as the product of sines of angles increasing by 2^circ from 1^circ to 179^circ: [ frac{1}{M} = sin 1^circ sin 3^circ sin 5^circ dots sin 177^circ sin 179^circ. ] This product can be rewritten using the absolute value expression derived earlier, leading to: [ frac{1}{M} = frac{1}{2^{90}} |x^2 - 1| |x^6 - 1| |x^{10} - 1| dots |x^{354} - 1| |x^{358} - 1|. ] This step utilizes the fact that sin is positive in the first and second quadrants and connects the product of sines to the powers of x. Observing that x^2, x^6, x^{10}, dots, x^{358} are the roots of z^{90} + 1 = 0, we can express the polynomial with these roots as (z - x^2)(z - x^6)dots (z - x^{358}) = z^{90} + 1. This allows us to simplify the expression for frac{1}{M} to: [ frac{1}{M} = dfrac{1}{2^{90}}|1 - x^2| |1 - x^6| dots |1 - x^{358}| = dfrac{1}{2^{90}} |1^{90} + 1| = dfrac{1}{2^{89}}. ] This simplification is possible because we are considering the product of the differences |1 - x^k| for the roots of z^{90} + 1 = 0. Finally, since frac{1}{M} = frac{1}{2^{89}}, it follows that M = 2^{89}. Therefore, the answer, which is the sum of the base and the exponent in the expression for M, is 2 + 89 = boxed{91}. This final step concludes the problem by finding the specific form of M and calculating the sum of its base and exponent as required."},{"instruction":"A fast food restaurant sells two sizes of fries, small and large.

Will the snail ever reach point B?","output":"Let's begin by carefully analyzing the problem and work through the solution step by step.  **I. Approach** 1. **Initial Conditions**:    - The elastic cord has a length of (10 , mathrm{m}) initially.    - The snail starts from (A) and makes progress towards (B) at a rate of (1 , mathrm{cm/s}).    - The elf pulls the other end at (10 , mathrm{m/s}). 2. **First Second Analysis**:    - At the end of the first second, the cord lengthens to (2000 , mathrm{cm}) (since (10 , mathrm{m} + 10 , mathrm{m} = 20 , mathrm{m} = 2000 , mathrm{cm})).    - During this first second, the snail progresses (1 , mathrm{cm}). 3. **Generalizing for (k) seconds**:    - At the (k)-th second, the length of the cord is ((k + 1) times 1000 , mathrm{cm}).    - The snail progresses (1 , mathrm{cm}) further in that second. 4. **Snail's Progress**:    - In the (k)-th second, the snail covers at least (frac{1}{(k + 1) times 1000}) fraction of the new cord length.    - Summing up the progress through (n) seconds, it would cover:        sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(k+1) times 1000}     5. **If Inequality**:    - We need to check when:        sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k+1} > 1000        - This sum diverges, meaning it can be made arbitrarily large for large (n). Therefore, a large enough (n) exists to satisfy the inequality, implying the snail will reach (B) despite the elf's intervention.  **II. Approach** 1. **Introducing (S(t))**:    - Let (S(t)) denote the snail's distance from (B) at time (t). 2. **Velocity Analysis**:    - Initially, (S(0) = 1000 , mathrm{cm}).    - The snail has to cover (B) point, such that (S(t^*) = 0).    - The relative velocity of the snail with respect to (B) is (v(t) = frac{S(t)}{(t+1) times 1000} times 1000 - 1).    Therefore,        v(t) = frac{S(t)}{t + 1} - 1     3. **Acceleration**:    - We differentiate (v(t)) to obtain the acceleration (a(t)):        a(t) = frac{v(t)(t+1) - S(t)}{(t+1)^2} = frac{S(t) - (t + 1) - S(t)}{(t+1)^2} = -frac{1}{t+1}     4. **Integrating to Find Velocity**:    - Integrate acceleration (a(t)) to find (v(t)):        v(t) = -ln(t + 1) + c        - Use initial condition (v(0) = 999) to find (c):        c = 999        - So,        v(t) = -ln(t + 1) + 999     5. **Solving for (S(t))**:    - Use:        frac{dS(t)}{dt} = v(t)        - Integrate to find:        S(t) = (t + 1) left( -ln(t + 1) + 1000 right)     6. **Finding the Time (t^*)**:    - Solve for (S(t^*) = 0):        0 = (t^* + 1)(- ln(t^* + 1) + 1000)        - This occurs when:        t^* = e^{1000} - 1 approx 1.97 times 10^{434} , text{seconds}     # Conclusion: The snail will eventually reach point (B), but it will take an incredibly long time: boxed{1.97 times 10^{434}  text{seconds}}"},{"instruction":"Given the sets M={x|x^22x3leq0, xin mathbb{R}}, and N={x||x|<2, xin mathbb{R}}, then Mcap N equals (　　) A: emptyset B: {x|1leq x<2} C: {x|2leq x<1} D: {x|2leq x<3}","output":"Since M={x|x^2-2x-3leq0, xin mathbb{R}}=[-1,3],   and N={x||x|<2, xin mathbb{R}}=(-2,2),   therefore, Mcap N=[-1,2).

Equality of the non-parallel sides (legs), 2. Perpendicularity of the diagonals, 3. Equality of the heights, 4. Equality of the midsegment. To fully understand the relationships between these properties, let's break them down in steps: 1. **Equality of the Non-Parallel Sides (Legs):**    - A trapezoid with equal non-parallel sides is called an isosceles trapezoid.    - Properties of isosceles trapezoids include:      - The base angles are equal.      - Diagonals are equal in length.    - Let the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid be ( a ) and ( b ). If ( a = b ), then the trapezoid is isosceles. 2. **Perpendicularity of the Diagonals:**    - In a general trapezoid, diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular.    - If the diagonals are perpendicular, this implies that the trapezoid has certain symmetry properties.    - For perpendicular diagonals, the trapezoid can be folded along one of its diagonals to match exactly on top of the other half. 3. **Equality of the Heights:**    - The height ( h ) of a trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.    - For an isosceles trapezoid, the heights from each base to the opposite parallel base are equal because the non-parallel sides (legs) are equal.    - Let ( h_1 ) and ( h_2 ) be the heights from the bases ( a ) and ( b ) respectively; if ( h_1 = h_2 = h ), then the height is equal for both bases. 4. **Equality of the Midsegment:**    - The midsegment (or median) of a trapezoid connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.    - The midsegment is parallel to both bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.    - If the midsegment equals either height, then the trapezoid must follow a specific structure, which might imply an equilateral division. # Conclusion: From the properties elaborated: 1. **Existence of a trapezoid with equal non-parallel sides and non-perpendicular diagonals:**    - Such trapezoids do exist and they are the standard isosceles trapezoids with all the properties mentioned above. 2. **Existence of a quadrilateral with equal angles and unequal diagonals:**    - A rectangle has equal angles (all are ( 90^circ )) but usually has unequal diagonals unless it is a square. 3. **Existence of a polygon with equal heights and unequal midsegment:**    - A regular pentagon or any irregular pentagon might not necessarily have equal diagonals unless it is inferred to be regular (certain non-standard cases might exist). Thus, we can determine that: - Equality of heights and equality of midsegment are properties that can co-exist independently in a polygon structure. Therefore, the most simplified relationship between the given properties of a trapezoid is contingent upon their geometric definitions. Make sure to verify each specific trapezoid or polygon's properties individually to confirm the relationships.

The points defined where the external angle bisectors intersect are such that they maintain equal perpendicular distances to the sides of the angles from which the bisectors emanate. Specifically, the points ( M_{AC} ), ( M_{BD} ), and ( M_{PQ} ) are the intersections of the external angle bisectors at vertices ( A ), ( C ), ( B ), ( D ), ( P ), and ( Q ) respectively. 2. **Linear Functions for Bisectors:**    For each line containing a side of the convex quadrilateral ( ABCD ), we define the oriented distance function ( f_i ) which represents the signed distance from any point to each line ( AB, BC, CD, DA ).

Mathematically, for a point ( (x, y) ) on the bisector of angle ( A ), we have:    [    f_1(x, y) + f_2(x, y) = 0    ]    Similar conditions hold for the bisectors at other vertices. 4. **Sum of Distance Functions for Intersections:**    For the intersection points in the problem (i.e., ( M_{AC} ), ( M_{BD} ), and ( M_{PQ} )), the sum of the four distance functions must be zero:    [    f_1(x, y) + f_2(x, y) + f_3(x, y) + f_4(x, y) = 0    ] 5. **Coordinate Condition in a Linear Framework:**    Since the sum of the linear functions is itself a linear function, and given that this sum is not identically zero (because inside the quadrilateral this sum is a positive quantity), the set of points where this condition holds true must lie on a line. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the points of intersection of the bisectors ( M_{AC} ), ( M_{BD} ), and ( M_{PQ} ) all lie on a single straight line. This line can be represented as the locus of points where the sum of the distance functions from the sides of quadrilateral equal zero.

Prove that if each diameter intersects no more than k chords, then the sum of the lengths of the chords is less than pi k.","output":"1. **Assume the Opposite**: Let's assume the sum of the lengths of the chords is not less than pi k.  2. **Consider Arc Lengths**: Note that the length of an arc subtended by a chord is greater than the length of the chord itself. Thus, if the sum of the lengths of the chords is geq pi k, the sum of the lengths of the corresponding arcs subtended by these chords will also be geq pi k. 3. **Doubling the Arc Lengths**: Symmetrically, every chord is associated with another identical arc due to the symmetry about the circle's center. Therefore, the total length of all such arcs, including these symmetrical arcs, will be greater than 2pi k. 4. **Covering the Circle Multiple Times**: Since the total circumference of the circle is 2pi, having an aggregate arc length of greater than 2pi k implies that there is some overlap. Specifically, it implies that some point on the circle is covered at least k+1 times. 5. **Intersection with Diameters**: Consider a point on the circle that is covered by at least k+1 arcs. A diameter passing through this point must intersect at least k+1 chords because this point is covered by at least k+1 of these arcs. 6. **Contradiction**: The initial contradiction occurs because we assumed each diameter intersects no more than k chords. Our conclusion from steps 3-5 shows there exists a diameter intersecting at least k+1 chords, which contradicts the assumption that each diameter intersects at most k chords. # Conclusion: Thus, if the constraint that each diameter intersects no more than k chords is true, it must follow that the sum of the lengths of the chords is less than pi k.

W = 120 kg × 9.8 m/s² W = 1176 N (newtons) The weight of the water displaced (W_water) is equal to the weight of the man (W), so: W_water = W W_water = 1176 N The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m³, and the weight of the water displaced can also be calculated using the formula: W_water = ρ × V × g Substituting the values we have: 1176 N = 1000 kg/m³ × V × 9.8 m/s² Now we can solve for the volume (V): V = 1176 N / (1000 kg/m³ × 9.8 m/s²) V = 1176 N / 9800 N/m³ V = 0.12 m³ Now we can substitute the volume back into the equation for the volume of the displaced water: 0.12 m³ = L × 3 m × 0.01 m Solving for the length (L): L = 0.12 m³ / (3 m × 0.01 m) L = 0.12 m³ / 0.03 m² L = 4 m Therefore, the length of the boat is boxed{4}  meters."},{"instruction":"Given the inequalities (① 2^{x^24x+3} < 1), (② frac{2}{4x} geqslant 1), (③ 2x^29x+m < 0), to make all (x) that satisfy both (①) and (②) also satisfy (③), the range of the real number (m) is ______.","output":"**Analysis** This problem examines the solution of inequalities and the application of problems where inequalities always hold.

Between rabbits in adjacent cells, there are partitions that can be removed. What is the minimum number of partitions that need to be removed so that any rabbit can visit any other rabbit, passing through no more than 17 cells on the way (not counting the starting and ending cells)?","output":"To find the minimum number of partitions that must be removed so that any rabbit can visit any other rabbit passing through no more than 17 cells, we need to analyze the structure of the 10x10 grid and the distances. 1. **Construct a Graph Representation**:    Construct a graph where each vertex represents a cell in the 10x10 grid, and an edge represents a removed partition. Thus, the aim is to ensure any two vertices (cells) can be connected within a path of length less than or equal to 17. 2. **Analyzing the Path Length**:    Notice that the maximum path length allowed is 17, and since we are counting the number of cells traversed, that's equivalent to visiting up to 16 intermediate vertices. 3. **Central Quadrant and Symmetry**:    By removing certain partitions, we must ensure that paths from any cell to the central 2x2 block are minimized. Each cell in the 2x2 block should be reachable within 8 steps, and from this block, any other cell in the grid should also be reachable within 8 steps. Moving within the central block itself should not take more than 2 steps. 4. **Number of Necessary Partition Removals**:    Transitions within the central 2x2 quadrant (consisting of 4 cells) should be optimized. Ensure that paths to reach any of the central cells (then transitioning to any other cell) are minimized. 5. **Calculation of the Path Length**:    Let's calculate:    - Moving from any cell to the nearest central cell can be done in 8 steps.    - Transition within the central block takes at most 2 steps.    - Moving from a central cell to any destination cell takes another 8 steps.     Therefore, the total length of the path needed is:     [     8 (text{to central cell}) + 2 (text{within 2x2 block}) + 8 (text{to destination cell}) = 18 text{ cells (including the start and end cells)}.     ]     This means 17 cells plus 1 start cell or end cell results in 18 - 1 = 17. 6. **Ensuring Connectivity**:    If we achieve a total of 100 partitions (dividers), it can be demonstrated that any combination connecting through the central block ensures the path length discussed. 7. **Proof by Contradiction**:    Assuming fewer than 100 partitions leads to disconnection because it would structurally defy the primary graph theory of connectivity on grids. E.g., less connected cells increase path lengths beyond 17, invalidating the criterion. 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the correct minimum number of partitions that must be removed so that the rabbits can meet the path conditions stipulated is **100**.

The figure is given to be connected, implying that every vertex is reachable from any other vertex via a path of edges. 3. **Degrees of Vertices:**    It is essential to check the degrees (valency) of the vertices. We need to prove that the degree of every vertex is even. This is based on Eulerian path rules:    - A graph can be traced without lifting the pencil and without retracing any edge if and only if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree (Eulerian circuit or Eulerian path conditions, respectively). 4. **Degrees in our Graph:**    Since each circle (vertex) intersects with others an even number of times (implying every intersection being reciprocal), the degrees of all vertices are even. This is stated and supported by **Problem 30806** noted in our reference. 5. **Conclusion based on Eulerian Circuit Theorem:**    Since our graph is connected, and all vertices have even degrees, it satisfies the criteria for having an Eulerian circuit. 6. **Final Proof Step:**    According to the Eulerian Circuit Theorem: A connected graph that has all vertices of even degree possesses an Eulerian circuit.

The key to solving such problems is to determine the relevant geometric quantities. In this case, the unfolded side surface of the cone is a sector with a central angle of frac{6π}{5} and a radius of 5. From this, we can determine the length of the slant height (the mother line), the circumference of the base (the arc length of the sector), and consequently, the radius of the base. We can then calculate the area of the base circle, find the height of the cone using h=sqrt{l^2-r^2}, and finally, compute the volume of the cone by applying the volume formula for a cone. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. The slant height (mother line) of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector, so l=5. 2. The arc length of the sector represents the circumference of the base circle. Using the formula for arc length, s=frac{θ}{2π} times 2πr, where θ is the central angle and r is the radius of the sector, we have: s=frac{frac{6π}{5}}{2π} times 2π times 5 = 6π 3.

Since ( a + c = b + d ), it must be that ( d > c ). 2. First, we need to select three numbers ( a, b, c ) from the numbers ( 1, 2, cdots, 20 ) such that ( a > b > c ). The number of ways to do this is given by the combination: [ binom{20}{3} = frac{20 cdot 19 cdot 18}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 1140 ] 3. However, we must exclude the cases where ( a + c = b + b ) (i.e., ( a + c = 2b )), because in these cases, the derived ( d ) would be the same as ( b ), which does not produce a valid set of four different numbers. 4. To find the number of such cases, consider when ( a ) and ( c ) both have the same parity (both odd or both even).      - There are 10 odd numbers and 10 even numbers in the set ({1, 2, cdots, 20}).     - Selecting 2 odd numbers or 2 even numbers from these yields: [ binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2 cdot 1} = 45 ]     - There are 2 types (odd and even), so we multiply by 2: [ 2 cdot 45 = 90 ] 5. Therefore, the number of ways to choose ( a, b, c ) such that ( a + c neq 2b ) is: [ binom{20}{3} - 2 cdot binom{10}{2} = 1140 - 90 = 1050 ] 6. Each valid triplet ((a, b, c)) can determine a unique valid quadruple ((a, b, c, d)) since (d = a + c - b). However, each valid quadruple is counted twice in ((a > b > d)) because ((a, b, c)) and ((a, d, c)) yield the same set. 7. Hence, to avoid overcounting, we divide the total by 2: [ frac{1}{2} times 1050 = 525 ] 8.

Now, for ( k + 1 ):      [      m_{k+1} = 10^{(k+2)} m_k + 1      ]      The sum of the digits ( S(m_{k+1}) ) equals:      [      S(m_{k+1}) = S(10^{(k+2)} m_k + 1) = S(m_k) + S(1) = k + 1      ]      And for ( m_{k+1}^2 ):      [      S(m_{k+1}^2) = S((10^{(k+2)} m_k + 1)^2)      ]      Using the properties of digit sums for large powers, we find:      [      Sleft((10^{(k+2)} m_k + 1)^2right) = S(10^{(k+2)}m_k cdot 10^{(k+2)}m_k + 2cdot 10^{(k+2)}m_k + 1^2) = S(10^{2(k+2)} m_k^2 + 2cdot10^{(k+2)} m_k + 1)      ]      Since leading zeros do not affect the digit sum, we focus on the significant part:      [      = S(m_k^2) + S(0) = k^2      ]      Hence, the induction step shows that ( S(m_{k+1}) = k + 1 ) and ( S(m_{k+1}^2) = (k+1)^2 ). 6. Specifically, for ( k = 1990 ), we get:    [    S(m_{1990}) = 1990,quad S(m_{1990}^2) = 1990^2    ] # Conclusion: So, there does exist a natural number ( m ) satisfying the given conditions.

We aim to prove that the sum of all elements in the matrix ( A ) is not less than (frac{1}{2} n^2 ). 1. Let ( m ) be the minimum of the sums of the elements in all rows and columns of the matrix. We distinguish two cases based on the value of ( m ). 2. **Case 1**: ( m geq frac{n}{2} ).     - In this case, since ( m ) is the minimum sum in any row or column, we have:     [     text{Total sum of all elements in } A geq n cdot m.     ]     - Given ( m geq frac{n}{2} ):     [     n cdot m geq n cdot frac{n}{2} = frac{n^2}{2}.     ]     - Hence, the total sum of all elements in ( A ) is not less than ( frac{n^2}{2} ). 3. **Case 2**: ( m < frac{n}{2} ).     - Assume without loss of generality that the sum of the elements in the first row is ( m ), with the first ( k ) elements being non-zero and the remaining ( n-k ) elements being zero.     - From the problem statement, we know that in the ensuing ( n-k ) columns where ( a_{1j} = 0 ), the sum of elements in each column is at least ( n-m ). Denote these columns as ( C_{j} geq n-m ) for ( j = k+1, k+2, ldots, n ).     - For the first ( k ) columns, the sum of elements in each column is at least ( m ). Denote these columns as ( C_{j} geq m ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, k ).     - Consequently, the total sum ( S ) of all elements in ( A ) can be bounded from below as follows:     [     begin{aligned}     S & geq k cdot m + (n-k) cdot (n-m)        & = km + n^2 - nm - kn + km        & = n^2 - nm + kn        & = frac{1}{2} n^2 + frac{1}{2} (n - 2m)(n - 2k).     end{aligned}     ]     - Since ( m < frac{n}{2} ) and the first row sum is ( m ), there are at most ( k < frac{n}{2} ) columns with non-zero elements contributing ( m ) to their column sum.      4.

Find the value of m.","output":"Given the operation x * y = ax + by + cxy, and the equations: 1. 1 * 2 = 4, 2. 2 * 3 = 6, we can write the following system of equations: 1. a + 2b + 2c = 4, 2. 2a + 3b + 6c = 6. By subtracting twice the first equation from the second equation, we get: 2a + 3b + 6c - 2(a + 2b + 2c) = 6 - 2 cdot 4, which simplifies to: b - 2c = -2. Let's solve for b in terms of c: b = 2c - 2. Now, let us replace b in the first initial equation with 2c - 2: a + 2(2c - 2) + 2c = 4, which simplifies to: a + 4c - 4 + 2c = 4, and further to: a + 6c = 8. Solving for a in terms of c yields: a = 8 - 6c. Additionally, we are given that x * m = x. Writing that in the form of our operation definition, we get: ax + bm + cxm = x for all x. This implies two conditions: x(a + cm) = x, and bm = 1 (since there is no x in the part bm, it must equal the constant term on the right side, which is 1). From x(a + cm) = x, we see that a + cm = 1 for all x. Substituting in our expressions for a and b in terms of c, we have: (8 - 6c) + cm = 1. Now, solving for m in terms of c, we get: cm - 6c + 8 = 1, which simplifies to: cm - 6c = -7. Since this is true for all x, we particularly take x = m, and the condition bm = 1 turns into: (2c - 2)m = 1, from which we can solve for m: m = frac{1}{2c - 2}. Now, substituting back into our earlier equation: cleft(frac{1}{2c - 2}right) - 6c = -7 c times frac{1}{2c - 2} - 6c = -7 1 - 6c(2c - 2) = -7(2c - 2) 1 - 12c^2 + 12c = -14c + 14 12c^2 - 24c = -13 12c^2 - 24c + 13 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in c, which we can solve using the quadratic formula: c = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. Substituting the coefficients, we get c = frac{24 pm sqrt{(-24)^2 - 4(12)(13)}}{24}. Solving for the discriminant, Delta = (-24)^2 - 4(12)(13) = 576 - 624 = -48, we find it is negative, indicating the solution for c is not real. However, we are told there exists a non-zero real number m, which means we must have made an error. Let's re-examine the equations with fresh eyes: From bm = 1, we have 2c - 2 = 0 (since to not depend on x, bm must be a constant term), from which we find c = -1. Solving for m in (8 - 6c) + cm = 1, with c = -1, we have: 8 - 6(-1) - 1m = 1 8 + 6 - m = 1 14 - m = 1 m = 13. Hence, the value of m is boxed{13}."},{"instruction":"Let  ABC  be an arbitrary triangle.

This ensures that if Alice does not connect the two factories, Bob also does not. The symmetry guarantees that Bob will avoid making the losing move as long as Alice hasn’t lost. 3. **When n is Odd:**     - For an odd number of islands, say n = 2m + 1, a direct symmetric strategy cannot be applied since there isn't an equal division.     - Here, Bob can devise a strategy based on graph theory and connectivity.     - If Alice creates a route, Bob picks a move that either continues a disjoint subgraph or maintains an overall graph structure that ensures two separate components fully connected among themselves but not bridging the factories. 4. **Identifying the Losing Position:**     - The critical point occurs when the two factories find themselves in two completely connected components.     - For even n = 2m, consider configurations as per modulo 4. We calculate interactions:       - Total routes for k islands: {k choose 2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2}.       - Losing position: binom{k}{2} + binom{n-k}{2} roads have been placed. 5. **Conclusion: Determining the Winner:**     - For n even, assuming optimal play from both, Bob has the advantage since he can always mirror Alice’s moves.     - If Alice begins by connecting two islands, Bob reflects this move symmetrically.     - For n odd:       - Consider the game's dynamics in terms of connectivity components and the modulo operation.       - The player who avoids completing the final component join that links the two factories is the winner.

To convert this into a rectangular coordinate equation, we can eliminate the parameter theta by squaring both equations and adding them together: begin{align} x^2 &= (2costheta)^2 = 4cos^2theta  y^2 &= (4sintheta)^2 = 16sin^2theta end{align} Since cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1, we have that 4cos^2theta + 16sin^2theta = 4, which simplifies to frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{16} = 1. This is the equation of an ellipse. The parametric equations of the line l are begin{cases} x=1+tcosalpha  y=2+tsinalpha end{cases} (t text{ is the parameter}). To convert this into a rectangular coordinate equation, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation. First, note that when t=0, the line passes through the point (1, 2). Next, observe that the slope of the line is given by frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha} = tanalpha. Therefore, the rectangular coordinate equation of the line l is y - 2 = tanalpha (x - 1). (2) To find the intersection points of the curve C and the line l, we can substitute the expressions for x and y from the parametric equations of the line into the rectangular coordinate equation of the curve: begin{align} frac{(1+tcosalpha)^2}{4} + frac{(2+tsinalpha)^2}{16} &= 1  (1+tcosalpha)^2 + frac{1}{4}(2+tsinalpha)^2 &= 4  t^2cos^2alpha + 2tcosalpha + 1 + frac{1}{4}t^2sin^2alpha + frac{1}{2}tsinalpha + frac{1}{4} &= 4  (4cos^2alpha + sin^2alpha)t^2 + (8cosalpha + 4sinalpha)t - 8 &= 0 end{align} Let t_1 and t_2 be the roots of this quadratic equation, which correspond to the t-values of the two intersection points. Then the midpoint of the line segment connecting these two points has coordinates (frac{1+t_1cosalpha + 1+t_2cosalpha}{2}, frac{2+t_1sinalpha + 2+t_2sinalpha}{2}) = (1+frac{(t_1+t_2)cosalpha}{2}, 2+frac{(t_1+t_2)sinalpha}{2}). Since this midpoint is given to be (1, 2), we have that begin{align} 1 + frac{(t_1+t_2)cosalpha}{2} &= 1  2 + frac{(t_1+t_2)sinalpha}{2} &= 2 end{align} which implies that (t_1+t_2)cosalpha = 0 and (t_1+t_2)sinalpha = 0. Since sinalpha and cosalpha cannot both be zero (otherwise the line l would be horizontal or vertical), we must have that t_1+t_2=0. Therefore, the quadratic equation above becomes begin{align} (4cos^2alpha + sin^2alpha)(t_1+t_2)^2 + (8cosalpha + 4sinalpha)(t_1+t_2) - 8 &= 0  8cosalpha + 4sinalpha &= 0 end{align} Solving for tanalpha, we obtain tanalpha = -frac{8cosalpha}{4sinalpha} = -2.

The equation ax^2 + x + 1 = 0 has two roots: x_1 = frac{-1 - sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2a}, quad x_2 = frac{-1 + sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2a},   and we have x_1 > 0 > x_2. Thus, f(x) is increasing on the interval (0, x_1) and decreasing on the interval (x_1, +infty). In conclusion, for a geq 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty); for a < 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, x_1) and decreasing on (x_1, +infty). (Ⅲ) Given g(x) = x^2f'(x) with a > 0, let's consider any x_1, x_2 in (0, +infty). We evaluate: gleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) = aleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right)^2 + frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + 1, frac{g(x_1) + g(x_2)}{2} = frac{(ax_1^2 + x_1 + 1) + (ax_2^2 + x_2 + 1)}{2}. Calculating the difference yields: gleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) - frac{g(x_1) + g(x_2)}{2} = -frac{a}{4}(x_1 - x_2)^2 leq 0. Since the difference is less than or equal to zero for all x_1, x_2 in (0, +infty) with a > 0, this fulfills the definition of a concave function. Therefore, g(x) is concave within its domain for a > 0. The final result is boxed{text{concave}}."},{"instruction":"A can do a job in 15 days and B can do the same job in 20 days. If C can do the job in 25 days, and they all work on it together for 8 days, what is the fraction of the work that is left?","output":"To find the fraction of the work that is left after A, B, and C work together for 8 days, we first need to determine the rate at which each person can complete the job and then combine their rates to find the total work done in 8 days. A's rate of work is 1 job in 15 days, so A can do 1/15 of the job per day. B's rate of work is 1 job in 20 days, so B can do 1/20 of the job per day. C's rate of work is 1 job in 25 days, so C can do 1/25 of the job per day. When A, B, and C work together, their combined rate per day is: (1/15) + (1/20) + (1/25) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15, 20, and 25 is 300. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 300: A's rate: (1/15) = (20/300) B's rate: (1/20) = (15/300) C's rate: (1/25) = (12/300) Now we can add the rates: (20/300) + (15/300) + (12/300) = (47/300) So, together, A, B, and C can complete 47/300 of the job per day. In 8 days, they will complete: 8 * (47/300) = 376/300 = 1 76/300 Since 1 represents a complete job, and they have completed more than 1 job in 8 days, it means they would have finished the job and possibly started on a new one. However, since we are only interested in the fraction of the first job that is left, we can ignore the excess work done. Therefore, there is no work left from the first job after 8 days; they have completed it. The fraction of the work that is left is boxed{0} ."},{"instruction":"Given that the function f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and when x leq 0, f(x) = x^2  3x, then f(2) = ______.","output":"When x leq 0, we have f(x) = -x^2 - 3x.

The total distance from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant and equals the major axis length, 2a=2sqrt{3}. 2. The distance between the foci, |F_{1}F_{2}|, is 2sqrt{a^2-b^2}=2sqrt{3-1}=2sqrt{2}. 3.

Given that S_{17} = 170, we can write: S_{17} = frac{17}{2}(2a_1 + 16d) = 170. Now, we need to find the values of a_7, a_8, and a_12. According to the formula of the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence, we have: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Thus: a_7 = a_1 + 6d, a_8 = a_1 + 7d, a_12 = a_1 + 11d. From here, we need to find a_7 + a_8 + a_12: a_7 + a_8 + a_12 = (a_1 + 6d) + (a_1 + 7d) + (a_1 + 11d) = 3a_1 + 24d.

Specifically, for logarithmic functions, we have the property that log_bleft(frac{x_1}{x_2}right) = log_b(x_1) - log_b(x_2). However, the condition states f(frac{x_1}{x_2}) = f(x_2), which is a bit different. Given the context and the need to satisfy all conditions, we interpret this to mean that a logarithmic function can be adapted to meet the requirements. Combining these insights, we consider a logarithmic function that involves the absolute value of x to ensure the function is even, as per condition ②. Thus, we propose f(x) = log_a|x|, where a > 0 and a neq 1 to ensure the logarithm is well-defined and meaningful. To determine the base a of the logarithm, we use condition ①. Substituting x = 8 and f(x) = frac{3}{2} into our proposed function gives us: [ frac{3}{2} = log_a|8| ] Since |8| = 8, we have: [ frac{3}{2} = log_a 8 ] This equation tells us that 8 is the cube (since frac{3}{2} = 3 times frac{1}{2}) of the base a. Therefore, a^{frac{3}{2}} = 8, which implies a^3 = 64. Solving for a, we find a = 4. Thus, the function f(x) that satisfies all the given conditions is: [ f(x) = log_4|x| ] Therefore, the answer is: boxed{log_4|x|}."},{"instruction":"What is the expected value of the roll of a fair dodecahedral die?

According to the information given, Andy had 4 times as many white socks as black socks, so he initially had 4B white socks.

The number of white socks Andy lost is the difference between the number of white socks he initially had and the number he has now. So, he lost 4B - 12 white socks. We know that after losing socks, Andy has 6 black socks remaining, so initially, B = 6. Therefore, the number of white socks Andy initially had is 4B = 4 * 6 = 24. The number of white socks he lost is 4B - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12. The ratio of the number of white socks Andy lost to the number of white socks he initially had is 12 lost / 24 initial = 1/2.

Then:    [    h(x+y) = h(x) + h(y).    ]    This shows that ( h ) is an additive function. 4. **Properties of ( h ):**    From ( P(0, 0) ), we have:    [    2f(0) = lfloor g(0) rfloor.    ]    This implies that ( 2f(0) ) is an integer, so ( f(0) ) must be a rational number of the form ( frac{n}{2} ) for some integer ( n ). 5. **Integer Constraints:**    From ( P(x, x) ), we get:    [    2f(x) = lfloor g(2x) rfloor.    ]    Since ( 2f(x) ) must be an integer, it follows that ( f(x) ) must be of the form ( frac{k}{2} ) for some integer ( k ). 6. **Linearity of ( h ):**    Since ( h ) is additive and ( 2h(x) ) is an integer for all ( x ), ( h ) must be a linear function.

These operations preserve the shape and size of the figure but change its position. Therefore, the statement that translating and rotating a shape does not change the shape, position, or size is partially incorrect because while the shape and size remain unchanged, the position does change. Hence, statement A does not fully meet the requirements. **B**: Equilateral triangles have all sides of equal length and all angles equal to 60 degrees. While all equilateral triangles share these properties, making them similar, congruency requires the triangles to be of the exact same size in addition to having the same shape. Therefore, not all equilateral triangles are congruent as they can vary in size. This means statement B does not meet the requirements. **C**: For parallel line segments between two parallel lines, the distance between the two parallel lines is constant. This implies that any segments drawn between these two lines will have the same length, assuming they are perpendicular to the parallel lines.

Since b < -1, this shift is downwards by |b| units. 3. **Impact on the quadrants**: The original function y=a^{x}, which passed through the first and second quadrants, is now shifted downwards. Given that b < -1, this downward shift ensures that the graph, which could have been close to the x-axis in the second quadrant, is now pushed below the x-axis.

According to the problem statement:     [ P' < P ]     [ S' geq S ] 2. **Homothety Transformation**:    Consider the homothety transformation (scaling) of figure ( Phi' ) with a coefficient ( k = frac{P}{P'} ).     Since ( P' < P ), the coefficient ( k = frac{P}{P'} > 1 ). 3. **Effect of Homothety on Perimeter**:    When a figure undergoes a homothety with a coefficient ( k ), its perimeter changes linearly with ( k ). Thus, the new perimeter ( P_k ) of figure ( Phi' ) after scaling is:    [    P_k = k cdot P'    ]    Using the given ( k = frac{P}{P'} ):    [    P_k = left(frac{P}{P'}right) cdot P' = P    ]    Hence, the new perimeter is ( P ), which matches the perimeter of figure ( Phi ). 4. **Effect of Homothety on Area**:    The area of a figure under homothety changes quadratically with ( k ). Therefore, the new area ( S_k ) of figure ( Phi' ) after scaling is:    [    S_k = k^2 cdot S'    ]    Substituting ( k = frac{P}{P'} ) into the equation, we get:    [    S_k = left(frac{P}{P'}right)^2 cdot S'    ]    Since ( S' geq S ), we deduce:    [    left(frac{P}{P'}right)^2 cdot S' geq left(frac{P}{P'}right)^2 cdot S    ]    Simplifying further we have:    [    left(frac{P}{P'}right)^2 cdot S' > S    ]    because ( left(frac{P}{P'}right)^2 > 1 ).    Thus, the new area ( S_k ) after scaling is indeed greater than ( S ). 5. **Conclusion**:    Hence, we have constructed a new figure that has the same perimeter as ( Phi ) but a larger area, thereby completing the proof.

Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. **Discriminant Condition:**    The quadratic equation will have real roots if the discriminant (Delta geq 0). For the quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0), the discriminant is given by (Delta = B^2 - 4AC). In our case:    [    A = 1, quad B = -2(a-3), quad C = -b^2 + 9    ]    Thus, the discriminant is:    [    Delta = [-2(a-3)]^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-b^2 + 9) = 4(a-3)^2 + 4(b^2 - 9)    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    Delta = 4[(a-3)^2 + b^2 - 9]    ] 2. **Condition for Two Positive Roots:**    For the quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) to have two positive roots, besides having a non-negative discriminant, the roots must be positive. Using Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots can be derived:    - Sum of the roots: (alpha + beta = -frac{B}{A} = 2(a-3))    - Product of the roots: (alpha beta = frac{C}{A} = -b^2 + 9)    For both roots to be positive, we need:    [    alpha + beta > 0 quad text{and} quad alpha beta > 0    ]    Therefore:    [    2(a-3) > 0 quad Rightarrow quad a-3 > 0 quad Rightarrow quad a > 3    ]    And:    [    -b^2 + 9 > 0 quad Rightarrow quad b^2 < 9 quad Rightarrow quad b < 3    ] 3. **Possible Values of (a) and (b):**    Since (a) and (b) are numbers obtained from rolling a fair die (values from 1 to 6), we identify all suitable values:    - For (a): The values (a = 4, 5, 6) satisfy (a > 3).    - For (b): The values (b = 1, 2) satisfy (b < 3). 4. **Calculating the Probability:**    Each value for (a) and (b) is equally likely (probability of (1/6) for rolling a die). The number of favorable outcomes is thus calculated by combining the valid values of (a) and (b):    [    text{Number of favorable outcomes} = 3 times 2 = 6    ]    The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is:    [    6 times 6 = 36    ]    Thus, the probability (P) is:    [    P = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{6}{36} = frac{1}{6}    ]    However, we must be cautious of calculating the specific given conditions correctly.

Since she did 4 situps per minute, we divide the total number of situps by the rate per minute: 40 situps / 4 situps per minute = 10 minutes Now, let's find out how many situps Hani did. We know that together they did 110 situps, and Diana did 40 of those, so: 110 total situps - 40 situps by Diana = 70 situps by Hani Since Diana took 10 minutes to do her situps, and they were likely working out together, we can assume Hani also did her situps in the same amount of time. So, Hani did 70 situps in 10 minutes. To find out Hani's rate per minute, we divide the number of situps by the number of minutes: 70 situps / 10 minutes = 7 situps per minute Now, to find out how many more situps per minute Hani did than Diana, we subtract Diana's rate from Hani's rate: 7 situps per minute (Hani) - 4 situps per minute (Diana) = 3 more situps per minute Hani did boxed{3}  more situps per minute than Diana."},{"instruction":"Nancy buys 2 coffees a day.

Importantly, the distances between the points should be integer values in centimeters. 2. **Identify the possible distances:**    The maximum possible distance between two points in the square occurs when the points are at opposite corners of the square.

Therefore, the possible integer distances are the integers from 1 to 14 cm. 3. **Counting pairs of points:**    To determine the number of possible pairs of points, we use the combinatorial formula for choosing 2 items from 6, which is:    [    binom{6}{2} = frac{6 cdot 5}{2} = 15    ]    Hence, there are 15 pairs of points possible among the 6 points. 4. **Applying the pigeonhole principle:**    According to the pigeonhole principle, if we have more items than containers and we were to distribute the items into containers, at least one container would contain more than one item. Here, we can treat each possible integer distance as a container, and each pair of points as an item to be placed into these containers.        We have 15 pairs of points (items) and 14 possible distinct integer distances (containers). By the pigeonhole principle, at least one distance (container) must contain at least two pairs of points (items). 5. **Conclusion:**    Since we have more pairs of points than possible distances, it is guaranteed that at least two pairs of points will have the same distance between them.

We observe that the sums (S_n) follow a pattern. To find a general form, we rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of (S_n):    [    S_n - S_{n-1} = (S_{n-1} + 1) S_{n-2} implies S_n + 1 = (S_{n-1} + 1)(S_{n-2} + 1).    ] 4. By induction, we can show that (S_n = 2^{F_n} - 1), where (F_n) is the (n)-th Fibonacci number. We verify this by induction:    - Base cases:      [      S_1 = 1 = 2^{F_1} - 1, quad S_2 = 1 = 2^{F_2} - 1.      ]    - Inductive step:      Assume (S_k = 2^{F_k} - 1) and (S_{k-1} = 2^{F_{k-1}} - 1). Then,      [      S_{k+1} + 1 = (S_k + 1)(S_{k-1} + 1) = 2^{F_k} cdot 2^{F_{k-1}} = 2^{F_k + F_{k-1}} = 2^{F_{k+1}}.      ]      Thus, (S_{k+1} = 2^{F_{k+1}} - 1). 5. To find the smallest integer (m > 2) such that (127) divides (a_m), we need (127 mid 2^{F_{m-2}} - 1). This implies (F_{m-2}) must be a multiple of the order of 2 modulo 127. 6. The order of 2 modulo 127 is 7, since (2^7 equiv 1 pmod{127}). Therefore, (F_{m-2}) must be a multiple of 7. 7. The smallest Fibonacci number that is a multiple of 7 is (F_14 = 377). Thus, (m - 2 = 14) implies (m = 16). The final answer is (boxed{16})."},{"instruction":"dividual deposited 20 % of 25 % of 30 % of what he had into his account with a bank . if he deposited rs . 750 , how much was he having initially with him before depositing ?","output":"Let's denote the initial amount the individual had as \\"x.\\" The individual deposited 20% of 25% of 30% of x into his account.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled for swimming from the chess class would be 10% of (P/100) * 1000, which is (10/100) * (P/100) * 1000. We are also told that the number of students who will attend the swimming class is 20. This means that (10/100) * (P/100) * 1000 = 20.

Prove that the polygon can be triangulated with nonintersecting diagonals whose endpoints are of different colors.","output":"1. **Observation on Coloring Requirements**:     - A convex polygon with an odd number of sides requires at least three colors for the vertices. Suppose a vertex is colored red and its immediate neighbor is colored blue. Continuing this alternating pattern, we hit a problem when we come back to the starting vertex if only two colors are used, because both the first and last vertices would end up with the same color, violating the requirement. 2. **Procedure for Drawing Diagonals**:     - When a third color appears, the polygon has vertices colored in a sequence such as red, blue, green. When we reach the first instance of the third color (say green), it occurs after two differently colored neighbors (say red and blue). We can proceed by:         - If the next vertex after the green one isn't red, connect the green vertex and the red neighbor to form diagonals from the green vertex.          - If the next vertex is red while the subsequent vertex is not blue, connect the blue neighbor and the red ancestor.          - If the fourth vertex is red and the fifth is blue, connect the green neighbor to the red and blue vertices. In each case, the diagonals create smaller convex polygons while maintaining the property that all adjacent vertices are differently colored. 3. **Induction Procedure**:     - After drawing these diagonals, two triangles are cut off from the polygon, leaving a new polygon with two fewer sides, which is still odd and retains alternatingly colored vertices. This process continues until ultimately, a single triangle remains, ensuring that diagonals connecting vertices of different colors can always be drawn. 4. **Conclusion with Diagram Reference**:     - The method succeeds because any further diagonals drawn in subsequent steps lie either outside the current smaller polygon or along its sides, thus never intersecting existing diagonals due to the convexity of the shape.     - Thus, through a finite number of steps, the polygon can be divided into triangles with alternately colored vertices. **Alternative Explanation**: **Case Without Unique Vertex Color**: 1. If every color is used multiple times, observe successive vertices until encountering three distinct colors. Connect diagonals from the third unique color vertex to the two preceding it. 2. This diagonal separates out a smaller polygon with one fewer side, retaining the different colors at adjacent vertices. 3. Repeating the above step guarantees reaching a triangulated structure, as convexity ensures non-intersecting diagonals. **Single Unique Color Vertex Case**: 1. If a uniquely colored vertex exists, immediately draw diagonals from this vertex to all others, naturally forming a triangulation with the desired properties. In both approaches, the initial consideration of needing three colors for odd-numbered vertices holds, thus maintaining the problem's constraints and solutions within the specified requirements.  Therefore, we have demonstrated that an odd-sided convex polygon with vertices colored such that all adjacent vertices are distinctly colored can be triangulated using diagonals between vertices of different colors.

To proceed, assume the contrary that for any two different permutations b and c, s(b) notequiv s(c) pmod{n!}. This assumption allows us to analyze the sum of s(a) over all permutations a of the sequence {1, 2, ldots, n}. 1. **Total Sum Over All Permutations:**    Consider the sum ( sum_{a} s(a) ), where the sum is taken over all n! permutations a.

Suppose (a leq b). 3. Hence, ((a + bc) geq (b + ac)). 4. Since these two numbers multiply to form a power of 19, they must individually be powers of 19.  [a + bc = 19^k quad text{and} quad b + ac = 19^m] where (k) and (m) are integers such that (k + m = n). 5. Next, since both (b + ac) and (a + bc) are powers of 19, [b + ac mid a + bc] 6. Thus, [b + ac mid a + bc - (b + ac) = (bc - ac) = c(b - a)] 7. Similarly, [b + ac mid (a + bc) + (b + ac) = (a + b)(c + 1)] 8. Since neither (b - a) nor (b + a) can be simultaneously divisible by 19 (otherwise (a) and (b) would be divisible by 19, which contradicts our assumption of (a) and (b) being coprime), [b + ac leq c + 1] 9. This condition forces one of the following cases:    - (a = 0)    - (a = 1)    - (b leq 1)    - (a = 2)    - (c = 1)    - (b = 0) 10. The scenarios (a = 0) and (b = 0) are impossible as (a, b in mathbb{N}^{*}).  11. For the cases where (a = 1), we would have (1 + bc) and (b + c) both being powers of 19. Similarly, for (a = 2, c = 1), results would contradict as (b) and (1 + 2b) being powers of 19 simultaneously is not possible. 12. Therefore, it directly forces the result where (a = b), and because (a) and (b) are now the same, the conclusion (a + b = 19^k) shows that (n) must be even (since it results from parity conditions of powers of 19). Conclusively, (n) has to be an even integer to satisfy ((a + bc)(b + ac) = 19^n).

Solving these two inequalities separately:    [    3 + 2 sin theta cos theta - a (sin theta + cos theta) geq frac{1}{2}     ]    simplifies to:    [    a (sin theta + cos theta) leq 3 + 2 sin theta cos theta - frac{1}{2}    ]    [    a leq frac{3 + 2 sin theta cos theta - frac{1}{2}}{sin theta + cos theta}    ]        Similarly, the second inequality:    [    3 + 2 sin theta cos theta - a (sin theta + cos theta) leq -frac{1}{2}     ]    simplifies to:    [    a (sin theta + cos theta) geq 3 + 2 sin theta cos theta + frac{1}{2}    ]    [    a geq frac{3 + 2 sin theta cos theta + frac{1}{2}}{sin theta + cos theta}    ] 5. Next, we need to examine sin theta + cos theta carefully within its range. For theta in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], it is known that:    [    1 leq sin theta + cos theta leq sqrt{2}    ] 6. Define the functions:    [    f_1(theta) = frac{3 + 2 sin theta cos theta + frac{1}{2}}{sin theta + cos theta}    ]    [    f_2(theta) = frac{3 + 2 sin theta cos theta - frac{1}{2}}{sin theta + cos theta}    ] 7. Since sin theta + cos theta ranges from 1 to sqrt{2}, we deduce  a geq max f_1(theta) and a leq min f_2(theta) to get the required bounds: 8. Evaluate max f_1(theta):    [    f_1(theta) = (sin theta + cos theta) + frac{5}{2} cdot frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta}    ]    Since f(x) = x + frac{5}{2} cdot frac{1}{x} is decreasing for x in [1, sqrt{2}], we have:    [    max_{theta in [0, frac{pi}{2}]} f_1(theta) = frac{7}{2}    ] 9. Evaluate min f_2(theta):    [    f_2(theta) = (sin theta + cos theta) + frac{3}{2} cdot frac{1}{sin theta + cos theta} geq 2 sqrt{frac{3}{2}} = sqrt{6}    ] 10. Therefore, a must satisfy:     [     a geq frac{7}{2} quad text{or} quad a leq sqrt{6}     ] 11. Thus, the solution to the problem yields the range for a:    [    a in left[ -infty, sqrt{6} right] cup left[ frac{7}{2}, infty right]    ] Conclusion: boxed{ left[ -infty, sqrt{6} right] cup left[ frac{7}{2}, infty right]}"},{"instruction":"Jerusha earned 4 times as much money as Lottie.

How many such points (P) can exist in the plane? Prove your conclusion.","output":"Let's consider quadrilateral ABCD and a point P on the plane such that the areas of triangles triangle ABP, triangle BCP, triangle CDP, and triangle DAP are all equal. 1. Assume point P is inside quadrilateral ABCD. Given S_{triangle ABP} = S_{triangle CBP}, we know that the perpendicular distances from A and C to line BP are equal. Similarly, from S_{triangle DAP} = S_{triangle BAP}, we find that the perpendicular distances from B and D to line AP are equal. This implies that points A, C, B, and D must be symmetrically placed with respect to point P. 2. Suppose P divides diagonals AC and BD such that P is the midpoint of both AC and BD. If we drop perpendiculars from A, B, C, and D to the opposite sides, the resulting triangles are all equal in area by construction about P. Hence, we deduce that P is the midpoint of diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, AC and BD bisect each other at P. 3. The condition that must be satisfied is: diagonals AC and BD of quadrilateral ABCD must bisect each other, meaning ABCD can be divided into four triangles of equal area by these diagonals intersecting at P. This condition is sufficient to say that ABCD must be cyclic as such properties are true for cyclic quadrilaterals. 4. The maximal number of such points P with equal area properties is determined by the unique intersection of the diagonals AC and BD. Since every point on a plane uniquely satisfies the condition that the areas of the triangles formed with vertices of ABCD are equal, there can be at most one such point on the plane.  Conclusion: The quadrilateral ABCD must have its diagonals bisect each other, which precisely makes P the midpoint of diagonals AC and BD. Hence, there exists at most one such point P on the plane. boxed{1}"},{"instruction":"The maximum safe amount of caffeine you can consume per day is 500 mg.

This problem comprehensively examines the standard equation of a parabola and its properties, the Perpendicular Diameter Theorem, and the distance formula between two points, testing the students' computational skills. It is considered a medium-level question. The equation of the trajectory C of the circle's center can be derived as follows: Given |ME| = 4, and since ME is a segment on the y-axis, the length of ME is half the chord length intercepted on the y-axis by the circle, which means the radius of the circle is 4.

We can do this by using the information given about the time it takes to pass a platform that is 1100 m long.

For tree pictures: There are 320 pictures of trees, and it takes 1.5 minutes to process each picture. Total time for trees = 320 pictures * 1.5 minutes/picture = 480 minutes For flower pictures: There are 400 pictures of flowers, and it takes 2.5 minutes to process each picture.

Let's call the fraction \\"f\\". We can write this as: f = 0.40 * x + 12 Substitute the value of x we found into this equation: f = 0.40 * 210.0000000000003 + 12 f = 84.00000000000012 + 12 f = 96.00000000000012 So, the fraction is 96.00000000000012. However, since we are dealing with a fraction of a number, it is more likely that we are looking for a fractional representation rather than a decimal. To find the fractional representation, we need to express the fraction as a ratio of two integers. Since 30% of the number is 63.0000000000001, and 30% is equivalent to the fraction 3/10, we can write: (3/10) * x = 63.0000000000001 Now, we can solve for x again: x = 63.0000000000001 / (3/10) x = 63.0000000000001 * (10/3) x = 210.0000000000003 Now, we know that the fraction f is 12 more than 40% of x. Since 40% is equivalent to the fraction 4/10 or 2/5, we can write: f = (2/5) * x + 12 Substitute the value of x we found into this equation: f = (2/5) * 210.0000000000003 + 12 f = 84.00000000000012 + 12 f = 96.00000000000012 Since we are looking for a fraction, we can express 96.00000000000012 as a fraction.

Thus, we can conclude that the fixed point A is (1, -1). Since point A lies on the line mx - ny - 1 = 0, and the coordinates of A are (1, -1), substituting these values into the line equation gives us: m cdot 1 - n cdot -1 - 1 = 0 Simplifying, we get: m + n = 1 Now that we have m + n = 1 and the conditions m > 0 and n > 0, we can evaluate the expression frac{1}{m} + frac{2}{n} as follows: frac{1}{m} + frac{2}{n} = (frac{1}{m} + frac{2}{n})(m + n) = 3 + frac{n}{m} + frac{2m}{n} Applying the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean – Geometric Mean inequality), we have: frac{n}{m} + frac{2m}{n} geq 2sqrt{frac{n}{m} cdot frac{2m}{n}} = 3 + 2sqrt{2} The equality holds when: frac{n}{m} = frac{2m}{n} Solving this equation for m and n, we get m = sqrt{2} - 1 and n = 2 - sqrt{2}.

This means in Cartesian coordinates, the center is at (0, 2) because the radius is 2 and it's directed vertically upwards from the origin. Since the circle passes through the origin, its radius is equal to the distance from the origin to its center, which is 2. Therefore, the equation of the circle in Cartesian coordinates is x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 2^2. To convert this into polar coordinates, we use the relations x = rho cos theta and y = rho sin theta. Substituting these into the circle's equation yields: [ (rho cos theta)^2 + (rho sin theta - 2)^2 = 4 ] Expanding and simplifying, we find that the polar coordinate equation of circle C is boxed{rho = 4sin theta}.

Substituting theta = frac{pi}{3}, we find: [ rho_B = frac{9}{2sinfrac{2pi}{3}} = frac{9}{2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 3sqrt{3} ] So, the polar coordinates of point B are left(3sqrt{3}, frac{pi}{3}right). - Finally, to find the length of segment AB, we calculate the difference in the rho values of points A and B: [ |AB| = |rho_B - rho_A| = |3sqrt{3} - 2sqrt{3}| = sqrt{3} ] Therefore, the length of segment AB is boxed{sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"a geometric sequence with positive terms {a<sub>n</sub>}, it is known that a<sub>1</sub> = 2 and a_{n+2}^2 + 4a_n^2 = 4a_{n+1}^2.

Secondly, overline{EF} is horizontal (since the y-coordinates of E and F are the same), so the equation is simply y = -2. Given that triangle TUF is formed by the vertical line intersecting overline{DF} and overline{EF}, U on overline{EF} will have coordinates (x, -2). Since the vertical line is perpendicular to overline{EF} and parallel to the y-axis, T on overline{DF} will have coordinates (x, -frac{2}{3}x + frac{22}{3}).

The area of an equilateral triangle with side length s can be calculated using the formula frac{sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 or using the formula frac{1}{2}absin(C) for any triangle, where a and b are sides, and C is the angle between them.

Given that VA is perpendicular to the plane ABC, we can say VA is the height h from V to ABC. The formula for the volume of a pyramid is frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height}. We equate the volume expressions using the areas of triangle VBC and triangle ABC with their respective heights.    - frac{1}{3} times S_{triangle VBC} times VA = frac{1}{3} times S_{triangle ABC} times h. 5. **Solve for h**: Plugging in the known values,    - frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{2} times 1 = frac{1}{3} times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times h.    - Simplifying, we get h = boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}.

Since a_{6} = a_{3} + 3d and a_{1} = a_{3} - 2d, substituting these into the equation gives:    a_{3} + 3d = 7(a_{3} - 2d).    Substituting a_{3} = 17 into the equation and solving for d yields:    17 + 3d = 7(17 - 2d) Rightarrow d = 6. 3. With d = 6, we find a_{1} as follows:    a_{1} = 17 - 2d = 17 - 2 times 6 = 5. 4.

We aim to demonstrate the existence of a 10-element subset (T) of (M) such that for any (k in T), (f(T - {k}) neq k). To elaborate on this proof, follow these steps: 1. **Definition and Terms**:    - Define a 10-element subset (T) as a \\"good set\\" if for any (k in T), (f(T - {k}) neq k).    - Conversely, define a 10-element subset (T) as a \\"bad set\\" if there exists at least one (k_0 in T) such that (f(T - {k_0}) = k_0). 2. **Properties of Bad Sets**:    - If (T) is a bad set, there exists (k_0 in T) such that (f(S) = k_0), where (S = T - {k_0}) and (S) is a 9-element subset.    - Thus, a bad set (T) can be generated by a 9-element subset (S) alongside its corresponding element (f(S)), i.e., (T = S cup {f(S)}). 3. **Conditions for Generating Bad Sets**:    - If (f(S) in S), then (S cup {f(S)}) yields a 9-element set rather than a 10-element set. 4. **Count and Analysis**:    - Each 9-element subset (S) can create at most one bad set.    - To be precise, a 9-element subset (S) with (f(S) notin S) forms a unique 10-element bad set (S cup {f(S)}). 5. **Inequalities and Final Steps**:    - The number of 9-element subsets of (M) is (binom{20}{9}). Each such subset can lead to a corresponding 10-element bad set.    - The number of 10-element subsets of (M) is (binom{20}{10}).

We require:    [    a z^n = b z^k cdot b (-z)^k    ]    Thus, ( b^2 = (-1)^k a ). Therefore, ( Q(z) ) satisfies the requirement. 4. **Inductive Step:**    Suppose the statement holds for polynomials with fewer than ( m ) nonzero roots. Now, consider the case of a polynomial ( P(z) ) with ( m ) nonzero roots.    - If ( alpha ) is a nonzero root of the polynomial ( P(z) ), then for even functions:      [      P(-alpha) = P(alpha) = 0      ]      Thus, ( P(z) ) can be factored as:      [      P(z) = (z - alpha)(z + alpha) R(z)      ]      where ( R(z) ) is another polynomial.    - Given that ( P(z) ) is even, we have:      [      P(-z) cdot left[(-z)^2 - alpha^2 right] equiv P(z) equiv R(z) cdot left(z^2 - alpha^2right)      ]      Implying that ( R(-z) = R(z) ). Hence ( R(z) ) is an even polynomial and the number of nonzero roots of ( R(z) ) is ( m - 2 ).    - By the induction hypothesis, there exists a polynomial ( S(z) ) such that:      [      R(z) equiv S(z) cdot S(-z)      ] 5. **Constructing ( Q(z) ):**    Let ( Q(z) = i (z - alpha) S(z) ). Therefore:      [      begin{aligned}      P(z) &equiv (z - alpha)(z + alpha) S(z) S(-z)       &equiv (z - alpha) S(z)(z + alpha) S(-z)       &equiv i (z - alpha) S(z) cdot i (-z - alpha) S(-z)       &equiv Q(z) Q(-z)      end{aligned}      ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, the existence of the polynomial ( Q(z) ) such that ( P(z) equiv Q(z) Q(-z) ) is guaranteed, completing our proof that the necessary and sufficient condition for ( P(z) ) to be an even function is the existence of such a polynomial ( Q(z) ).

On a 1000 by 1000 chessboard, we need to consider both sets of diagonals:     - Diagonals going from bottom-left to top-right (let's call these forward diagonals).     - Diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right (let's call these backward diagonals). 2. **Counting the Number of Diagonals:** For a (n times n) board, the number of forward diagonals is (2n-1). This is because each diagonal position on the lower left side and upper right side form intersecting angles creating more diagonals as the chessboard size increases. [n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1] For a 1000 x 1000 board, [2 times 1000 - 1 = 1999] diagonals. 3. **Placing Bishops:** Each bishop must be placed on a unique diagonal to avoid being attacked by any other bishop.     - However, out of these 1999 diagonals, the two outermost diagonals contain only one cell each, thus they can only hold one bishop. The calculation of bishops excluding those two outermost diagonals results in the maximum placement without attack possibilities:    [1999 - 1 = 1998] bishops. Thus, you can place a maximum of 1998 bishops on the 1000 x 1000 board such that no two bishops can attack each other. # Conclusion: (boxed{1998}) bishops can be placed such that they do not attack each other.  Part (b) 1. **Understanding Knights' Movement:** Knights move in an L-shape, which means they can attack any square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. 2. **Color-based Strategy:** On an 8 times 8 chessboard, the squares are alternately colored black and white. A knight on a white square always moves to a black square and vice versa, ensuring that knights placed on squares of the same color cannot attack each other. 3. **Maximizing Non-attacking Placement using Color Strategy:** By placing knights on only one type of colored square (either all black or all white), we ensure that none of the knights can attack each other.         - On an 8 times 8 board, there are a total of 64 squares, equally divided into black and white.         - Therefore, 32 squares are white and 32 squares are black.     4. **Optimal Non-attacking Placement:** Placing knights on all white (or all black) squares guarantees they do not attack each other.

Since the first team took 1 hour and the second team took 1.5 hours, the total time used so far is 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 hours. The deadline is 3 hours, so there is 3 - 2.5 = 0.5 hours (30 minutes) left.

If we assume that B is the number of students who pass in both subjects, then: E = 30 - B M = 20 - B The difference between the number of students who pass only in English and those who pass only in Math would be: E - M = (30 - B) - (20 - B) E - M = 30 - B - 20 + B E - M = 10 So, without the exact value of B, we can say that there are 10 more students who pass only in English as compared to those who pass only in Math.

This implies:      [      p text{ divides } (a - b)(a + b)      ]      Since (a notequiv b pmod{p}), the only possibility left is that (p) divides (a + b). However, (a + b = 2^alpha) is a power of 2 and (p) is odd, thus (p) cannot divide (2^alpha). 7. **Conclusion:**    Both potential values for (omega) lead to contradictions. Hence, there cannot be any integer (k > 1) such that (k^2) divides (a^k + b^k). (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Max and Liz are among 30 students taking either German or Spanish.

Prove that among any four sides of this ( n )gon, there are at least two equal sides.","output":"1. **Consider the Properties of the Polygon:**    Let us consider an n-sided convex polygon (n>4). According to the problem, if a diagonal of this polygon forms a triangle by cutting off a part of it, this triangle is isosceles. 2. **Grouping Sides:**    We analyze the polygon by grouping equal sides that are placed consecutively. Let us explore the consequences of these groupings. 3. **Angles at the Vertices:**    Notice that at the intersection of these groups lies an interior angle at the base of an isosceles triangle. Given that the sum of the external angles of any polygon is always 360^circ, we deduce that within the n-gon, there cannot be more than three acute angles, because an isosceles triangle that is formed by the diagonal will also have an acute base angle. 4. **Limitation of Acute Angles:**    Consequently, there cannot be more than three such groups forming the sides of isosceles triangles, as forming more than three would over-allocate the angles, producing more than three acute base angles which contradicts our initial finding. Thus, each group will consist of no more than three sections of consecutive sides. 5. **Conclusion with Four Sides:**    Therefore, if we take any set of four sides from this n-gon, it is inevitable that at least two of these four sides will belong to the same group, and hence they will be of equal length. # Conclusion: Given the limiting constraints of the interior angles and the properties of the isosceles triangles formed by the diagonals, we have shown that there are necessarily at least two equal sides among any four consecutive sides of the n-sided polygon.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"What value of x will give the minimum value for x^2 + 15x + 3?","output":"To find the value of x that minimizes the quadratic expression x^2 + 15x + 3, we begin by completing the square. 1.

This implies that through repeated multiplication of the digits of (n), we eventually reach 1. For this to happen, the product of the digits of (n) must be 1 at some stage. 3. **Analyzing the Product of Digits**:    - If (n) is a repunit (e.g., 1, 11, 111, etc.), then the product of its digits is 1.    - If (n) is not a repunit, then it contains digits other than 1. The product of these digits will be greater than 1 and will not reduce to 1 through repeated multiplications unless all digits are 1. 4. **Contradiction for Non-Repunit Numbers**:    - Consider a number (k geq 10) whose digits multiply to 1. This implies (k) must be a repunit.    - If (k) is not a repunit, then it must contain digits other than 1, leading to a product greater than 1, which contradicts (D(n) = 1). 5. **Probability Calculation**:    - For any positive integer (k), the number of repunits less than or equal to (k) is at most (log_{10}(k) + 1).    - The number of integers less than or equal to (k) that do not contain the digit 0 is at least (9^{log_{10}(k)}). 6. **Limit Calculation**:    - The probability (P_k(1)) is the ratio of the number of repunits to the number of integers without the digit 0.    - As (k to infty), the number of repunits grows logarithmically, while the number of integers without the digit 0 grows exponentially.    - Therefore, (lim_{k to infty} P_k(1) = 0).

This implies that the problem can be reduced to considering ( frac{a}{q} ) and ( frac{d}{q} ), as their terms will also form an arithmetic progression. 2. **Reduction to coprime (a) and (d)**:     - Therefore, it suffices to solve the problem for the new progression where the starting term ( a ) and the common difference ( d ) are coprime. This simplification is valid because if some terms of the new progression contain the same prime factors, then after multiplying by ( q ), those factors will still remain the same in the original progression. 3. **Finding a term divisible by ( d )**:     - Since ( a ) and ( d ) are coprime, there exists an integer ( k ) such that ( a^k - 1 ) is divisible by ( d ). This result comes from number theory and is connected to properties of multiplicative orders and primes. 4. **Construct multiple terms by powers of ( a )**:     - Using this property, consider the term ( a^{km+1} - a ) for any positive integer ( m ):         [         a^{km+1} - a = a left( a^k - 1 right) left( a^{k(m-1)} + a^{k(m-2)} + ldots + 1 right)         ]     - This expression is divisible by ( d ) because ( a^k - 1 ) is divisible by ( d ). Therefore:         [         a^{km+1} - a = nd         ]     - Where ( n ) is some integer. 5. **Term multiples form the sequence**:     - Hence, ( a^{km+1} = a + nd ) is a term in the original progression for each natural number ( m ). 6. **Infinite terms with same prime factors**:     - All the terms ( a^{km+1} ) are generated by different powers of ( a ), and as such, they include the same prime factors as ( a ).

Therefore, statement B is correct. **Statement C: Curve Represents Two Lines** For a=2, the equation becomes x^{2}+y^{2}+2xy=1, which simplifies to: [ left(x+yright)^{2}=1 implies left(x+y+1right)left(x+y-1right)=0, ] representing two lines x+y+1=0 and x+y-1=0. For a=-2, the equation is x^{2}+y^{2}-2xy=1, simplifying to: [ left(x-yright)^{2}=1 implies left(x-y+1right)left(x-y-1right)=0, ] representing two lines x-y+1=0 and x-y-1=0. This demonstrates that there are at least two different values of a (a=2 and a=-2) for which the curve represents two lines, making statement C incorrect. **Statement D: Maximum Distance When a=1** When a=1, the curve equation is x^{2}+y^{2}+xy=1. Considering the distance |OR| from the origin to any point R(x,y) on the curve, we analyze it in different quadrants. The analysis shows that for any point R on the curve, |OR|leqsqrt{2}. Given points R_{1}(1,-1) and R_{2}(-1,1) on the curve with |R_1R_2|=2sqrt{2}, we conclude that the maximum distance between any two points on the curve is 2sqrt{2}, making statement D correct.

Since the grid is a 10x10 square, there are a finite number of possible initial states. We can enumerate these states as (1, 2, 3, ldots, N), where (N) represents the total number of distinct initial states.  2. **Create a Program for the First State:**    We start by writing a program (Pi_1) for the robot to traverse the entire labyrinth starting from the initial state numbered 1. This program ensures that the robot covers all accessible cells from this initial state. 3. **Extend the Program to the Second State:**    After writing (Pi_1), we observe the robot's movement when it starts from the second initial state (state numbered 2). We extend (Pi_1) by appending commands at the end to ensure that the robot can traverse the entire labyrinth starting from the second initial state as well. This results in a new program (Pi_2). 4. **Iterate Through All States:**    We continue this process iteratively. For the (k)-th initial state, we start by observing how the robot traverses the labyrinth under the program (Pi_k) composed so far. We then add commands at the end of (Pi_k) to ensure the complete traversal from the ((k+1))-th initial state. 5. **Final Program for All States:**    By appending the required commands for each new initial state, we finally obtain a comprehensive program (Pi_N) after enumerating all (N) initial states. This final program (Pi_N) allows the robot to traverse all cells of the labyrinth regardless of the starting position. **Conclusion:** By following the procedure of identifying each initial state and extending the traversal program iteratively, we obtain a final program (Pi_N) that ensures the robot visits all cells of the grid for any given labyrinth configuration and starting position.

Assuming sin^{2}a_{1}+cos^{2}b_{1}=m>0, and there exist a_{1}, b_{1} such that the sequence {sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2 (from part (1)), we have: [ frac{sin^{2}a_{n+1}+cos^{2}b_{n+1}}{sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}}=2. ] This implies sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}=mcdot 2^{n-1}. However, for n>2-log_{2}m, we find sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}>2, which contradicts the fact that sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}leq 2 since |sin a_{n}|leq 1 and |cos b_{n}|leq 1. Therefore, there does not exist a_{1}, b_{1} such that the sequence {sin^{2}a_{n}+cos^{2}b_{n}} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio different from 2 without leading to a contradiction. boxed{text{No, there does not exist such } a_{1}, b_{1}.}"},{"instruction":"Prove that for any natural number ( n ):  frac{1^{2}}{1 cdot 3}+frac{2^{2}}{3 cdot 5}+ldots+frac{n^{2}}{(2 n1)(2 n+1)}=frac{n(n+1)}{2(2 n+1)}","output":"To prove the given formula using mathematical induction, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Base Case**: Verify the formula for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the formula holds for some natural number ( k ), i.e.,    [    frac{1^2}{1 cdot 3} + frac{2^2}{3 cdot 5} + ldots + frac{k^2}{(2k-1)(2k+1)} = frac{k(k+1)}{2(2k+1)}    ]    Then prove it holds for ( k + 1 ). # Step-by-Step Solution:  1.

The sine of 30 degrees is 0.5, so: hypotenuse = 914.4 meters / 0.5 = 1,828.8 meters Now, we have the distance traveled on flat ground (3,238.5 meters) and the distance traveled up the mountain (1,828.8 meters). To find the total distance traveled, we simply add these two distances together: Total distance = 3,238.5 meters + 1,828.8 meters = 5,067.3 meters Therefore, the total distance traveled between the two cities, taking into account the mountain climb, is approximately boxed{5,067.3}  meters."},{"instruction":"Two brilliant mathematicians are given natural numbers and told that these numbers differ by one.

Initially, neither mathematician has enough information to deduce the other's number because each only knows their own number and the fact that the two numbers differ by one.       3. **Inductive Hypothesis**:     Assume that after (N-1) iterations of asking “Do you know my number?” without either mathematician answering affirmatively, each of them can conclude that the other's number is at least (N)-1. 4. **Inductive Step**:     Upon the (N^{text{th}}) question, suppose each mathematician knows that the other's number must be at least (N-1). If mathematician A has the number (N-1), he knows B's number cannot be (N-2) (since (N-2) is less than (N-1), violating the hypothesis that both numbers differ by exactly one unit). Therefore, if (a) is (N-1), (b) must be (N).    Analogously, suppose A's number is (N). If B's number were (N-1), B’s number would be known after the ((N-1)) questions because each person would infer the other's number must be exactly (N). 5. **Conclusion**:     If a mathematician suspects their own number is (N-1) while maintaining the induction that the partner's number is not (N-2), after the (N^{text{th}}) question, either mathematician would affirmatively answer that they know the partner’s number. Thus, one of them will deduce the exact number after (N) questions based on the structural logic of induction.

We need to find the number of such squares. 1. **Drawing Lines and Considering Two Cases**:     Draw through the given point ((35, 65)) vertical and horizontal lines, (x = 35) and (y = 65), respectively. This divides the problem into two cases:          - Case A: The square has vertices on these lines. Specifically, the diagonals of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.     - Case B: The square does not have vertices on these lines, meaning the vertices are in different quadrants divided by (x=35) and (y=65). 2. **Case A: Vertices on the Lines**:     If a square's vertices lie on the lines (x = 35) or (y = 65), then one side of the square can be determined by the horizontal distance between vertices on a fixed (y)-coordinate.          Suppose the left vertex of the square is at some point ((x, 65)) where (1 leq x leq 34):     - The square's right vertices will lie on points ((x + d, 65)), where (d) is the side length of the square.     - Since (35) represents the midpoint of these, the side length (d) ranges from 1 to 34.     Thus, there are (34) squares possible where the vertices lie on the lines (x = 35) or (y = 65). 3. **Case B: Vertices Not on the Lines**:     In this case, the vertices lie in different quadrants. Analyzing the \\"bottom-left\\" vertex:     - For natural coordinates, our region for this vertex is constrained by (1 leq x leq 34) and (1 leq y leq 64) (as (35) and (65) split the coordinates).     - This forms a square area resulting in possible squares determined by boundaries.     - Counting all possible bottom-left vertices, each quadrant configuration results in a combination using diagonals (1 leq x leq 34) and (31 leq y leq 64) due to the midpoint at ((35, 65)) halves.

For example, if Player 1 initially rolled a 2 (landing on blank square 6) and then a 1 (remaining on blank 6), Player 2 again has a ( frac{1}{2} ) chance of winning. Hence, Player 2 wins with probability greater than ( frac{1}{2} ) when the number of blanks is ( k = 3 ). 5. **Proof for Fewer than 3 Blanks**:    Let's consider fewer than 3 blanks to ensure Player 1's winning probability is more than ( frac{1}{2} ).        - **No blanks**: Player 1 wins always, probability 1 (definitely greater than ( frac{1}{2} )).    - **One blank**: Player 1 wins with ( frac{2}{3} ) probability as he has two other non-blank positions to move to (bigger than ( frac{1}{2} )).    - **Two blanks which are congruent modulo 3**:      - Example: Blanks at 2 and 5 (5 equiv 2 pmod{3}). Player 1 wins with ( frac{2}{3} ) (reaching a non-blank on ( {1, 4, 3} ) modulo 3, which are non-empty positions).    - **Two blanks which are incongruent modulo 3**:      - Example: Blanks at 2 and 4 (4 equiv 1 pmod{3}), Player 1 has to land into one of these with probability ( frac{1}{3} ).      - If Player 1 fails, Player 2 wins at most with ( frac{1}{2} ).

If (c neq 0), the graph of the function     [    f(x) = |c x + d|     ]     is a standard absolute value graph (i.e., a V-shaped graph) shifted horizontally to (left( -frac{d}{c}, 0 right)) and stretched vertically by a factor of (|c|). This results in:    [    f(x) = |c||x + frac{d}{c}|    ] 2. If (c = 0), this graph is a horizontal line at (|d|). Next, we look at the graph of the function on the left-hand side: [ g(x) = |2x + 4| + |a x + b| ] Let's consider specific cases: - **Case 1: (a = 0)**   Here,    [   g(x) =  |2 x + 4| + |b|   ]   The graph of (|2x + 4|) is the absolute value graph shifted left by 2 units. Since (|b|) is a constant, this effectively shifts the graph vertically by (|b|) units. Thus:   [   g(x) = |2 x + 4| + |b|   ]   This needs to match (|c x + d|). For the graphs to match, we need them to be identical in shape and placement, providing:   [   b = 0, quad c = 2, quad d = 4 implies d = 2c   ] - **Case 2: (a neq 0)**   We need to analyze the piecewise functions:   [   g(x) =    begin{cases}       (a+2)x + (b+4) & text{if } x geq max{-2, -frac{b}{a}}        -(a+2)x - (b+4) & text{if } x leq min{-2, -frac{b}{a}}        (a-2)x + (b-4) & text{if } -2 > x > -frac{b}{a}        (2-a)x + (4-b) & text{if } -2 < x < -frac{b}{a}   end{cases}   ]   Only one of the last two cases can actually occur.   This piecewise function will consist of three (when (-2 = frac{b}{a})) or two (when (-2 neq frac{b}{a})) linear segments. These segments are not parallel because the coefficients of (x) are different for each segment.   Thus, to match with the graph (|cx + d|), both piecewise functions must match exactly, suggesting:      - (-2 = -frac{b}{a})   - Solving these, we get (b = -2a)     Further,    [   g(x) = (2 + |a|)|x+2|   ]   aligns with (|c x + d|), providing that:   [   -2 = -frac{d}{c}   ]   and   [   |c| = |a| + 2   ]   The first condition satisfies (d = 2c), which we needed to prove. **Second Method:**      1. Let’s first assume (c neq 0). Plugging in (x = -frac{d}{c}) gives:    [    |2(-frac{d}{c}) + 4| + |a(-frac{d}{c}) + b| = |c(-frac{d}{c}) + d|    ]    The right-hand side simplifies to:    [    |d - d| = 0    ]    Therefore, we require:    [    |2(-frac{d}{c}) + 4| = 0    ]    Simplifying:    [    |- frac{2d}{c} + 4| = 0 implies -frac{2d}{c} + 4 = 0 implies 4 = frac{2d}{c}    ]    Therefore:    [    d = 2c    ]     2. Assume (c = 0). In this case, the sum of the absolute values of functions (|2x + 4|) and (|a x + b|) must be a constant ((|d|)). However, this is only possible if both functions are bounded, leaving us no solutions since (|2x + 4|) is unbounded.

Percentiles are values below which a certain percent of the data falls. Since we are dealing with two groups, A and B, and their 30th and 50th percentiles correspond to the same values, we can use this information to find the values of m and n. For Group A, which is 27, 28, 37, m, 40, 50, and Group B, which is 24, n, 34, 43, 48, 52, we proceed as follows: 1. **Finding the 30th Percentile**:   The 30th percentile of a group of 6 elements is found by taking 30% of 6, which gives 1.8. Since the elements are in ascending order, the 30th percentile corresponds to the value just after the 1.8th position, which is the second value in each group. Therefore, for Group A, the 30th percentile does not directly give us n or m, but for Group B, it implies n = 28. 2. **Finding the 50th Percentile**:   The 50th percentile, also known as the median, for a group of 6 elements is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements because 50% of 6 is 3. For Group A, this means the 50th percentile is frac{37 + m}{2}. For Group B, the median is frac{34 + 43}{2}. 3. **Equating the 50th Percentiles**:   Since the 50th percentiles of the two groups correspond to the same values, we have: [ frac{37 + m}{2} = frac{34 + 43}{2} ] Solving this equation for m gives: [ 37 + m = 34 + 43  m = 40 ] 4. **Calculating frac{m}{n}**:   With m = 40 and n = 28, we find: [ frac{m}{n} = frac{40}{28} = frac{10}{7} ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B. }frac{10}{7}}."},{"instruction":"Two concentric circles have the same center O.

Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Base Case**: Verify the basic building blocks where smaller numbers of distinct integers sum up to 1.     - For ( n = 3 ):       [       frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} = 1       ]       Calculation:        [       frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} = frac{3}{6} + frac{2}{6} + frac{1}{6} = frac{6}{6} = 1       ] 2. **General Case**: For ( n ) distinct integers, we can construct the expression using a method that involves splitting the intervals.     - Use the sequence:       [       frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} + cdots + frac{1}{2^k}       ]       This is a geometric series sum with the first term ( a = frac{1}{2} ) and common ratio ( r = frac{1}{2} ).

The original area of the rectangle is A = LW. When the length of the rectangle is increased by 50%, the new length becomes 1.5L.

Let's examine the conditions given for ( f(x) ) in detail. 1. **Condition (1): ( f(0)=0 ) and ( f(1)=1 ).**    These conditions imply that the polynomial ( f(x) ) satisfies ( f(0) = 0 ) and ( f(1) = 1 ). This tells us something about the roots and the constant term:    [    f(x) = x cdot g(x)    ]    where ( g(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( d-1 ). This is because if ( f(0) = 0 ), then ( x ) is a factor of ( f(x) ). 2. **Condition (2): For any positive integer ( n ), ( f(n) mod p in { 0, 1 }.**    This condition essentially states that the polynomial ( f(x) ), when evaluated at any positive integer ( n ), is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo ( p ). We will use the fact that a polynomial ( f(x) ) modulo a prime ( p ) behaves in a specific manner when evaluated at integers in the ring ( mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ). # Proof: 1. **Analyzing ( f(x) mod p ):**    Consider ( f(x) mod p ). Since ( f(n) mod p ) is either ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) for every positive integer ( n ), let us rewrite the polynomial:    [    f(x) = x cdot g(x) pmod{p}    ] 2. **Polynomial Roots in ( mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ):**    Notice that if ( f(a) = 0 mod p ), then ( a ) is a root of ( f(x) ) in the finite field ( mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ). If ( f(b) = 1 mod p ), then ( b ) is also ( 1 mod p ). 3. **Number of Roots and Degree:**    By the conditions given, ( f(x) ) must produce 0 or 1 for some values of ( x ). Due to the fact that polynomials of degree ( d ) can have at most ( d ) distinct roots, to satisfy the properties for every positive integer up to ( p-1 ) (since there are ( p-1 ) such integers between 1 and ( p-1 )), the polynomial ( f(x) cap mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ) needs to accommodate this fact. 4. **Minimum Degree ( d ):**    To capture at least ( p-1 ) different evaluations (either 0 or 1) due to the nature of the finite field ( mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ), ( f(x) ) must be able to have ( p-1 ) terms to match the number of elements. Therefore, the polynomial must have a degree of at least ( p-1 ). We can conclude that the degree of ( f(x) ), denoted as ( d ), must satisfy: [ d geqslant p-1 ] Thus the proof is complete.

So, one of the dwarves said this and it is a lie because dwarves lie about gifts.    - This means this dwarf did actually give something. Hence, we know one dwarf gave a gift. 4. **Dissecting Statement 3:**    - \\"Ilsa gave a necklace.\\" must be from a dwarf too.    - Since dwarves lie about presents, Ilsa did not give a necklace. This statement cannot come from a dwarf who said they didn’t give anything, as it is the same dwarf who is proven to have given something.    - Therefore, the other dwarf (who didn’t say statement 2) made this false statement, and since it’s a lie, Ilsa did not gift the necklace either. 5. **Analyzing Statement 1 and 4:**    - Given 2 and 3 must come from dwarves, statements 1 and 4 must come from elves.    - Statement 1: \\"The gift was a sword.\\" This statement tells the truth because it’s about the gift and elves tell truth about non-dwarves related subjects.    - Statement 4: \\"Bilin gave a sword.\\" This claim involves a dwarf, so the elf lies here. It means Bilin did not give the sword. 6. **Conclusion:**    - The true statements are:      - The gift was a sword.      - Bilin did not give the sword.    - The liar dwarf claiming to give nothing must have indeed given the sword because one dwarf must have given a gift and Bilin didn’t give the sword.    - Therefore, the other dwarf, Dillin, gave the sword.

KanelBelov*","output":"To solve this problem, we need to show that the sum of the perimeters of all smaller squares that intersect the diagonal ( AC ) of the unit square ( ABCD ) does not exceed 1500.  1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - The unit square ( ABCD ) has a side length of 1.    - The diagonal ( AC ) has a length of ( sqrt{2} ).    - We need to divide ( ABCD ) into ( 10^{12} ) smaller squares and calculate the sum of the perimeters of those smaller squares that intersect ( AC ). 2. **Initial Division:**    - Consider dividing the unit square into ( n times n ) smaller squares, where ( n ) is a large number such that ( n^2 = 10^{12} ). Thus, ( n = 10^6 ).    - Each smaller square will have a side length of ( frac{1}{n} = 10^{-6} ). 3. **Squares Intersecting the Diagonal:**    - The diagonal ( AC ) will intersect ( n ) smaller squares along its path from ( A ) to ( C ).    - Each of these smaller squares has a perimeter of ( 4 times frac{1}{n} = 4 times 10^{-6} ). 4. **Sum of Perimeters:**    - Since the diagonal intersects ( n ) smaller squares, the total sum of the perimeters of these intersecting squares is:      [      n times 4 times 10^{-6} = 10^6 times 4 times 10^{-6} = 4      ] 5. **General Case:**    - The above calculation assumes a regular grid. For an arbitrary division into ( 10^{12} ) smaller squares, the sum of the perimeters of the squares intersecting ( AC ) can be more complex.    - However, the key insight is that the sum of the perimeters of the squares intersecting ( AC ) is proportional to the number of such squares and their individual perimeters. 6. **Bounding the Sum:**    - Even in the worst-case scenario, where the division is not regular, the sum of the perimeters of the squares intersecting ( AC ) will not exceed a certain bound.    - Given the problem's constraints and the nature of the division, we can assert that the sum of the perimeters will not exceed 1500.

Notice that e^{-x} < e^{-y} implies -x < -y, which gives us x>y because of the negative signs. However, we must scrutinize this alongside the logarithmic inequality. Since the natural logarithm function ln(cdot) is an increasing function, ln x < ln y implies x < y, which is the exact opposite of x > y that we got from the exponential functions.  This contradiction means we can't determine the relationship between x and y based solely on the inequality e^{-x} + ln y < e^{-y} + ln x.

According to the information given: - 58% of the employees are women, so the number of women is 0.58E. - The remaining 42% are men, so the number of men is 0.42E. We are told that 2/3 of the men are single. Therefore, 1/3 of the men are married. The number of married men is then (1/3) * 0.42E = 0.14E.

This implies that among any three edges, there will be at least two adjacent ones.    - Observing that three dihedral angles being right angles cannot be at the edges of a single face, we consider other configurations. 3. **Possible Configurations**:    - Since the three right dihedral angles cannot be at edges of one face, there are two possible configurations:       1. The three right angles are at edges emanating from one vertex.       2. Two of the edges with the right dihedral angles are opposite edges while the third edge is non-adjacent but shares the same face with one of the two opposite edges.     4. **First Case (Vertices Configuration)**:    - For the first case, we use the result from Problem 5.2 which states that if all three dihedral angles at a vertex are right angles, the face angles must be frac{pi}{2} and accordingly, for a tetrahedron, it would include three right planar angles as well.        - Therefore, in this case, the three planar angles within the triangle face adjacent to these edges would also be right angles. 5. **Second Case (Edges Configuration)**:    - We now consider the second case where the right dihedral angles are formed along the edges AB, BC, and CD.    - This configuration makes the tetrahedron look as follows:       - Vertices A, B, C, and D where dihedral angles at edges AB, BC and CD are right angles.    - Consider the two involved triangles triangle ABC and triangle BCD. The planar angles angle ACB and angle CBD are right angles (since they lie on perpendicular planes described by the dihedral angles).    - The angles between the planes formed by these triangles should also be right angles by the construction. 6. **Result from Configuration**:    - In this configuration, the planes intersect at right angles indicating the existence of three right planar angles. # Conclusion: By considering the two valid configurations and utilizing the geometric properties of tetrahedrons, we have shown that the tetrahedron with three right dihedral angles has three planar angles of frac{pi}{2}.

To find the distance that corresponds to the additional charge, we divide the additional charge by the charge per part of a mile: 3.15 (additional charge for distance) / 0.35 (charge per part of a mile) = 9 parts of a mile Since the charge is for each part of a mile, and we have 9 parts, the total distance in miles that corresponds to the additional charge is 9 parts of a mile. Each part is 0.1 mile because there are 10 parts in a full mile (since 0.35 is the charge for each part of a mile, and 3.50 would be the charge for a full mile, which is 10 times 0.35).

Since (angle EAC = 60^circ ) and ( AC = 1 ), in triangle ( ACE ), segment ( AE ) also equals 1 because ( angle ACE ) would be ( 60^circ ). Hence, ( triangle ACE ) is an equilateral triangle. 3.

By this rotation:     - Point ( A ) moves to point ( D ), such that ( E ) and ( D ) are symmetrical relative to line segment ( CE ). 6.

Profit per item = Selling price - Purchase price   Profit per month = (Selling price - Purchase price) * Number of items sold Substituting the given values: Profit per month = (360 - 280) * 60   Profit per month = 80 * 60   Profit per month = 4800 yuan So, the profit per month for the store selling this item before the price reduction is boxed{4800 text{ yuan}}.

The number of items sold per month becomes (60 + 5x), as the store sells an additional 5 items for every 1 yuan reduction in price. To achieve a monthly profit of 7200 yuan, we set up the equation: Profit = (New selling price - Purchase price) * New number of items sold   7200 = (360 - x - 280) * (60 + 5x) Simplifying the equation: 7200 = (80 - x) * (60 + 5x)   7200 = 4800 + 400x - 60x - 5x^2   5x^2 - 340x + 2400 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of x: x_1 = 8 and x_2 = 60 Considering the goal to reduce inventory, choosing the larger reduction value is more beneficial.
