It was expected that the building would serve a dual purpose as a museum and as the presidential meeting place for state visitors. In April 2005, the Kiev City Council submitted a bill for 104 million hryvnias (approx. US 20 million) to the Ukrainian Government for reconstruction and restoration of the House with Chimaeras. The Council also allowed the Ukrainian government to construct a new square (closing off all automobile traffic) in front of the building for use in official ceremonies.Since May 2005, the building has been an official presidential residence, used for official and diplomatic ceremonies. The House with Chimaeras was used as a meeting place between Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin, when the latter visited Kiev on December 22, 2006. Included in the building are rooms for negotiations, tête-à-tête talks, the signing of official documents, as well as a special room for the press.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the building in whose front the Council allowed the Ukranian government to construct a new square?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Tom Brady pumps his fist as he leads the Patriots back from a 24-0 deficit. FOXBOROUGH – In a game of mistakes interspersed with guts and resilience, the last mistake lost it. Steven Gostkowski’s 31-yard field goal with 1:56 left in overtime was set up when Ryan Allen’s punt hit the Broncos’ Tony Carter at the Denver 13 and the Patriots had a 34-31 win. It was a wild game, a see-saw game and if we’re lucky, the Super Bowl will be this as exciting. It certainly could be as cold. “A lot of guys were heroes today,” said Bill Belichick, whose gutsy call to take the 20 mph wind and not the ball in overtime turned out to be the right one. It’s just a shame that the 14th meeting between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning had to end off a final turnover, sending the Broncos to 9-2 and the Patriots to 8-3. Certainly the Broncos’ Knowshon Moreno deserved better after a career night that saw him carry 37 times for 224 yards. He limped off the field with an ankle injury in overtime and was spotted in the locker room on crutches with his right ankle in a boot. Denver ran for 280 yards in all. Usually that’s enough to win a game, especially when the wind chill is dipping to zero degrees by the end of the night. But the Patriots, who always seem to find a way to win at home, rallied behind a shell-shocked-turned splendid Brady in the second half, their momentum rising in waves. He finished 34-50-344 with three TDs and zero INTs, rallying the Patriots from a 24-0 halftime deficit, the largest for any Pats team under Bill Belichick. Manning, who fell to 4-10 against his future Hall of Fame counterpart, really couldn’t answer back, except on the drive that began with 7:37 left and tied the game in regulation. “The game plan was to move the ball and score points,” he said, explaining a quiet night in which he threw for just 150 yards on 19-of-36. “We were moving the ball running the ball and Knowshon was hot. We were riding him.” Manning threw for two TDs but his one interception proved costly as it set up the third New England touchdown. The Patriots fumbled six times and lost three, all in the first 8:00 leading to 17 Denver points. The Broncos fumbled five times and lost three, the last one being decisive. PHOTOS: NFL WEEK 12: GIANTS FREEZE IN CLUTCH, PANTHERS WIN 7TH STRAIGHT “They’ve got a good offense. Tom’s a great quarterback,” Manning said. “We helped them with some short fields but give them credit they made the plays in the second half and we didn’t.” The Patriots didn’t look as though they belonged on the same field as the Broncos and many of their frozen fans took the opportunity to beat the traffic and go home. They were getting beat up on both sides of the line of scrimmage. The Broncos’ defense was swarming and they seemed to have no response. But it was if a switch had been thrown at halftime. The Patriots turned into the aggressors. Brady started getting time to throw. Manning started getting rushed. And the momentum swung to the home team. “You can pile all the disappointment on however you want to,” said Manning, who moved had two good drives in OT but couldn’t get the Broncos into field goal range. “We’re just thinking about his loss right now. ... I hated the way that ended and not getting a chance to get our hands on the ball.” “People don’t get credit for playing good halves,” said Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho. “Nobody cares at the end of day. We’ve just to learn from it and move on to Kansas City.” Showdown II will be a little different than the first matchup last week where the Broncos knocked the Chiefs from the unbeaten ranks. The Chiefs were stunned by the Chargers earlier in the day and, even at 9-2, both teams will enter the game with doubts, although the winner will likely go on to take the AFC West. Meanwhile, Sunday’s night’s game raised questions about the Broncos’ vulnerability – especially if Moreno is out for a long period of time – and Manning’s effectiveness in cold weather. They’ll have little margin for error in their last five games because the Pats moved to 8-3 with two of those losses ending in controversy. New England’s resiliency was on full display Sunday night and, with a three-game lead over the Jets and Dolphins in the AFC East, it will play the remainder of the season hunting home field advantage. “One minute, we were down 24-0,” Aqib Talib said. “The next minute, we were kicking the game-winning field goal.” Typical Patriots? The decisive play was a case in point, just a little special teams play that may have changed the season. Maybe it was a little karma payback. The Broncos had moved the ball better in overtime and Manning was looking forward to getting the ball back. Rookie punter Ryan Allen sent one high into the frigid sky. Ex-Pat Wes Welker back to receive, starting waving his players off. But the ball took a strange bounce and hopped off another ex-Pat, Tony Carter. Nate Ebner recovered. “I was just doing what I’m supposed to do in that situation. Your instincts take over. I don’t want to make too much out of it,” Ebner said. “I was just covering down on the punts like I always do. The punt returner was waving it off. Marquice Cole made a great play, pushing his guy into the ball and I was just watching. Ryan has been putting up some great punts, so it really goes to them. Just seeing the returner waving at it and then (Cole) pushing him in there. Just right place at the right time.” That’s often the Patriots’ way, isn’t it? Write a title for it.","output":"Tom Brady and the Patriots make an amazing comeback to win a thrilling game against the Broncos"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the composer without whose presence, according to Anthony Hicks, so unusual a project would not have been attempted? from the following article ?  Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\".

Here is a news article: A DOG lover has been reunited with his miniature schnauzer — after it was stolen by a driver delivering Amazon parcels to his home.      Richard Guttfield realised 11-month-old pet Wilma was missing moments after an independent courier dropped off an order of dog food.      The 51-year-old organised a search when she disappeared and contacted Amazon to check the driver’s GPS log to find out if he had any information.      It is believed the data showed the courier had gone home before making his next delivery — and that is where Wilma was found five days later.      Mr Guttfield, who owns a printing business, claimed Amazon only took him seriously when he emailed company founder Jeff Bezos.      The dad-of-one told The Sun: ‘I just want people to know this can happen.      ‘Our homes are all exposed to these drivers and the vast majority of them are great. But low lives will take advantage. It’s just a miracle I got Wilma back.’      He later posted on Facebook: ‘Wilma is safe and home now thanks to an amazing effort from a lot of kind-hearted people.’ Mr Guttfield said he was playing snooker in a converted barn at his £1.5million home in Marsworth, Buckinghamshire, last Friday, when the dog disappeared.      The pups sell for £1,200 each and he made an internet appeal and put up posters appealing for Wilma’s return after figuring she had been stolen.      He said of his phone calls to Amazon: ‘I had no real suspicions, so I explained it was not a witch hunt. I just wanted to know if the driver could help narrow down the search.’      But, days later, an Amazon worker called Mr Guttfield to ask: ‘Can you describe your dog?’      ‘I described her and he said, “She is here with me right now”,’ he added.      ‘He brought her straight over. He was a real star,’ said Mr Guttfield.      ‘ I asked how they had found her. He said he couldn’t say as it was under investigation.’      Amazon described the incident as ‘inexcusable’ and said the driver no longer worked for them. ||||| A puppy that was stolen by a driver delivering Amazon parcels in England has been reunited with its owner.      Businessman Richard Guttfield, 51, said his black miniature schnauzer Wilma had gone missing after a driver dropped off a package of dog food.      Guttfield said it was only after he emailed Amazon's CEO and founder Jeff Bezos in a plea to have his dog returned that the company responded.      \\"My puppy went missing after an Amazon delivery and after an email to Jeff (Bezos)… we had someone who was amazing who tracked the driver and found our dog and brought her home,\\" he told CNBC.      Amazon said that the driver in question would no longer deliver its packages. Drivers that deliver parcels for Amazon do not technically work for the company, but through a number of independent couriers.      \\"This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,\\" a spokesperson for the company said in an emailed statement. \\"We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named Richard had a little dog named Wilma. One day, a delivery driver from Amazon came to bring some dog food to Richard's house. After the driver left, Richard noticed that Wilma was missing. He looked for her and asked Amazon to help him find her. After some days and asking the big boss of Amazon, they found out that the driver had taken Wilma home. They returned Wilma to Richard, and the driver doesn't work with Amazon anymore. Richard is happy to have his dog back, thanks to kind people who helped him find her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Night of the Demon Context: In England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) visits his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis). Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary. It reveals Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. There, Holden and Karswell mock each another's beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days. Holden and his colleagues discuss Karswell and make plans to further examine Rand Hobart.

Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described \\"South of Heaven\\" as \\"an unorthodox set opener in theory\\", noting \\"the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, leading up to the slowly building crescendo\\" in a concert review.

Write an article based on this summary: The Philippines has temporarily banned its workers from travelling to Qatar after several Arab countries broke off diplomatic ties with the Gulf state. Article:","output":"Title: Philippines Imposes Temporary Ban on Workers Travelling to Qatar Amid Diplomatic Crisis  Introduction: The Philippines has imposed a temporary ban on its workers travelling to Qatar, as several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, broke off diplomatic ties with the Gulf state. The decision has left thousands of Filipino workers in limbo and raised concerns about their employment and safety in the region. Background: Over two million Filipinos work abroad, primarily in the Middle East, where they are employed in various sectors including domestic work, construction, and retail. The Philippines heavily relies on the remittances sent by these Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) to support their families and contribute to the national economy. In Qatar, there are approximately 140,000 Filipinos working, making it the fourth most popular Middle Eastern destination for OFWs. Reason for the Ban: The decision to impose a temporary ban on worker travel to Qatar has come amid a diplomatic crisis. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt have severed ties with Qatar, accusing the nation of supporting Islamist terrorism and destabilizing the region. While Qatar has denied these allegations, the situation has led to travel restrictions, forcing some airlines to cancel flights and suspending of Doha's only land border with Saudi Arabia. Implications for Filipino Workers: The travel ban imposed by the Philippines has raised concerns about the wellbeing and future of Filipino workers in Qatar, as well as those planning to travel to the country for work. The government's primary concern is the safety and security of OFWs. However, the travel restrictions are likely to disrupt the lives of thousands of Filipinos, possibly affecting their employment status and financial security. Government Response: The Philippine government has stated that they are closely monitoring the situation in Qatar and the wider Gulf region. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has established an OFW help desk to provide assistance and information to those affected by the crisis. Additionally, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) is coordinating with the Philippine embassies and consulates in the region to ensure that emergency assistance is available to OFWs affected by the situation.  Conclusion: The temporary ban on Filipino workers travelling to Qatar is a response to the escalating diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region. The Philippines government has taken this step to protect its citizens, while also expressing concern for the wellbeing and safety of the thousands of OFWs in Qatar. As the situation unfolds, the Philippine government is closely monitoring developments and is prepared to provide support and assistance to its nationals affected by the crisis in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: What issue is the author trying to address by promoting the Mediterranean diet? Options:  A. Fast food culture  B. consumption of dairy is too high  C. Obesity epidemic  D. not enough information A:","output":"The author is trying to address the issue of the fast food culture and the obesity epidemic (Options A and C) by promoting the Mediterranean diet.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.

In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - African-American music is an umbrella term covering a diverse range of musics and musical genres largely developed by African Americans. Their origins are in musical forms that arose out of the historical condition of slavery that characterized the lives of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.  - The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties.  - A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \\"musical form\\" and \\"musical style\\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, academics have argued that categorizing music by genre is inaccurate and outdated.  - Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. Blue notes (or \\"worried notes\\"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502.  - Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \\"folk\\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Andrew Dewey Kirk ( May 28 , 1898 -- December 11 , 1992 ) was a jazz saxophonist and tubist best known as a bandleader of the \`\` Twelve Clouds of Joy '' , popular during the swing era . Kirk grew up in Denver , Colorado , where he was tutored by Wilberforce Whiteman , Paul Whiteman 's father . Kirk started his musical career playing with George Morrison 's band , but then went on to join Terrence Holder 's Dark Clouds of Joy . In 1929 he was elected leader after Holder departed . Renaming the band Clouds of Joy , Kirk also relocated the band from Dallas , Texas , to Kansas City , Kansas . Although officially titled as the Clouds of Joy , the band has also been known to be called the Twelve Clouds of Joy due to the number of musicians in the band . They set up in the Pla - Mor Ballroom on the junction of 32nd and Main in Kansas City and made their first recording for Brunswick Records that same year . Mary Lou Williams came in as pianist at the last moment , but she impressed Brunswick 's Dave Kapp , so she became a regular member of the band . Kirk moved the band to Kansas City , and since their first recordings in 1929 -- 1930 , they grew highly popular as they epitomized the Kansas City jazz sound . In mid- 1936 , he was signed to Decca and made scores of popular records until 1946 . He presumably disbanded and reformed his band during that 6 - year recording layoff , as his 1929 - 1930 Brunswick appeared to have sold well enough to stay in the catalog through the period and 1933 - 34 pressings ( with the mid- 1930s label variations ) have been seen . In 1938 , Kirk and band held the top spot of the Billboard chart for 12 weeks with \`\` I Wo n't Tell a Soul ( I Love You ) '' , written by Hughie Charles and Ross Parker , featuring Pha Terrell on vocals . In 1942 , Kirk and His Clouds of Joy recorded \`\` Take It and Git '' , which on October 24 , 1942 , became the first single to hit number one on the Harlem Hit Parade , the predecessor to the Billboard R&B chart .

Question: A ball moves slower across the carpet than it does on the marble flooring. This is because the _____ has less resistance. (A) carpet (B) marble flooring The answer is:","output":"(B) marble flooring A ball moves slower across the carpet than it does on the marble flooring because the marble flooring has less resistance. In this scenario, the two main factors affecting the movement of the ball are the surface materials (carpet and marble) and the friction between these surfaces and the ball. Carpet is a soft, fibrous material made up of a pile attached to a backing. It usually consists of woven or tufted fibers and can be made from natural materials like wool or synthetic materials like nylon or polyester. On the other hand, marble is a hard, smooth, and polished stone that is derived from metamorphic rocks, particularly limestone. When a ball moves across a surface, it experiences friction, which is the force resisting its movement. This force is generated by the interaction of the ball's surface with the surface it is moving over. The amount of friction depends on the characteristics of the two surfaces in contact, as well as the weight of the object (in this case, the ball) and the normal force acting on the object due to gravity. In general, smoother and harder surfaces tend to produce less friction and therefore less resistance to the movement of the ball. The texture and the surface area of the material in contact with the ball affect the friction between them. When a ball moves over a carpeted surface, many small fibers from the carpet are in contact with the ball, which increases the surface area and, consequently, the friction between the ball and the carpet. This increased friction slows the ball down.  On the other hand, when a ball moves over marble flooring, there is a much smaller surface area in contact with the ball, due to the smoothness of the marble. Thus, the friction between the ball and the marble surface is reduced, resulting in less resistance. Consequently, the ball moves faster on marble flooring compared to carpet. This difference in resistance can also be attributed to the stiffness of the material. Carpet, being a soft and pliable material, tends to absorb some of the energy from the moving ball, which contributes to the slowing down of the ball. In contrast, marble is a much more rigid and unyielding material, which means that less energy is absorbed from the moving ball, allowing it to maintain its speed. In conclusion, the ball moves slower across the carpet than on the marble flooring due to the increased friction and resistance caused by the characteristics of the carpet's material. The marble flooring, being smoother, harder, and more rigid, has less resistance, allowing the ball to move at a faster pace across its surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose fearsome run in with ghosts has given him a mysterious illness known as \\"The Fright\\"?, using the article: Michael Baskin is an average 11-year-old boy. His father, Billy Baskin, is a struggling artist and temporary sole caregiver of the children while his wife attends to the needs of her recently deceased father in Australia. Upon hearing the news that an abandoned mansion has recently burned down, Michael and his friend Connie decide to explore the remains. Outside the mansion, Connie dares Michael to take a look inside, leading to a frightening encounter with the ghosts of its homeless inhabitants who had died in the fire. Michael does not know this yet, but his fearsome run in with the ghosts has given him a mysterious illness simply known as \\"The Fright\\". Michael wakes up the next morning to find out that \\"The Fright\\" has made him lose all of his hair. After a failed attempt with a wig (his wig was pulled off by an older boy during a fight in a soccer game), the ghosts visit Michael in his sleep and give him the recipe of a magical formula for hair growth, the main ingredient of which is peanut butter. Michael's first attempt to make the formula is thwarted when his father and sister think he is making something to ingest (rather than use topically) and dispose of it., what would be the answer ?

Let's simplify that first. 2663 - 3458 =  -795 Then, -795 - 8245 = -9040 So, the given equation reduces to 199o + 3099 = -9040 Step 2: Solve for 'o' First, let's make 'o' the subject by moving the constant 3099 from the left side to the right side. 199o + 3099 - 3099 = -9040 - 3099 This leads to  199o = -9040 - 3099 Now, calculate -9040 - 3099 to get: 199o = -12139 Finally, to find the value of 'o' divide each side by 199: o = -12139 / 199 Calculating this will give the final value for 'o'. Let's do the calculation: o = -12139 / 199 = -61 Hence, solution to the given equation is o = -61."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles.  Would kinetic energy in sample B likely be lost or retained?  Hint: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. Answer:","output":"Given the information and hint provided, we can infer that the collisions between gas particles (sample A) are assumed to be elastic. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved, meaning that no kinetic energy is lost during the collisions. Sample B, however, does not contain gas particles. Depending on the nature of the particles and their interactions, the collisions in sample B may be inelastic. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved, and some of the energy may be lost in other forms, such as heat or light. Since we don't have specific information about the type of particles in sample B and their interactions, we cannot precisely determine whether kinetic energy will be lost or retained. However, given the mention of gas particles having elastic collisions, it can be implied that sample B, which does not contain gas particles, might have a higher likelihood of experiencing inelastic collisions, where kinetic energy could be lost or transformed into other forms of energy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.

The","output":"damage to her old car was beyond repair, and the cost of fixing it would far exceed its value. Gina made the difficult decision to let her old car go and start the process of buying a new one. She was determined to find something that not only matched her needs but also her budget and lifestyle. After speaking with friends and family, doing extensive online research, and reading numerous reviews, Gina realized that there were multiple factors to consider while choosing her new car. Some of the aspects she prioritized were safety, fuel efficiency, price, reliability, and overall design. She began by browsing local dealerships' websites to see what was available. Gina also took the initiative to visit multiple dealerships in person so that she could test drive different makes and models. Throughout this process, Gina spoke with various salespeople to gather their opinions and recommendations. Taking note of what she liked and disliked about each car she test drove, Gina compiled a list of her top 5 contenders. These cars met all the requirements she had identified as important to her during her research. The list consisted of a mix of sedans, hatchbacks, and compact SUVs. Gina understood that it's crucial to compare quotes from different dealerships to ensure she's receiving the best possible deal. She contacted several dealerships, requesting price quotes for each of her top choices. While waiting for their responses, Gina continued her research by consulting consumer reports, reading more in-depth reviews from owners of these cars, and comparing various options and packages each model had to offer. Once she received the quotes, Gina analyzed the offers thoroughly. She wanted to make sure she understood the financing options, warranties, and extra features included in each offer. With this information in mind, Gina used her negotiation skills to receive a better deal on her preferred choice. Gina was down to two cars that seemed to meet all her requirements - a compact SUV and a fuel-efficient hatchback. To make her final decision, she reflected on her current needs and future plans. Gina figured that the compact SUV would be a better fit for her lifestyle, considering her weekend outdoor hobbies and the occasional long road trips she loved to take with her friends. Plus, the SUV also stood out for its safety features and higher driving position, which Gina found comforting. After settling on the compact SUV, Gina revisited the dealership where she had the best offer and finalized the financing terms. She opted for a comfortable down payment and monthly installments that didn't strain her budget. Before signing the papers, Gina made sure every detail was clear, including the maintenance and insurance expenses that would be her responsibility moving forward. With the paperwork complete and her new keys in hand, Gina couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and relief. She had successfully navigated the car buying process, and as a result, she had a vehicle that would provide her with the safety, reliability, and style she desired. Gina vowed to be a more cautious driver going forward, learning from her past experience and applying that wisdom to her life with her new car."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: George Stinney was executed at 14. Can his family now clear his name? An old storage shed, half swallowed by weeds, shimmers in the hazy winter sunshine opposite the Green Hill Missionary Baptist Church. This is all that remains of the thriving lumber yard and sawmill on which Alcolu, a rural town in South Carolina, was built. Back in 1944, in the Jim Crow era of the South, Green Hill was known as \\"the black church\\", while Clarendon Baptist Church across the railway tracks was \\"the white church\\". Those who remember the terrible events that unfolded in this dot of a place that spring and summer were children at the time and their memories are shaped by this same racial divide that split the community in two. From the Green Hill church it is a few minutes' walk, across a ploughed field littered with corn husks, to the shallow ditch in the woods where the bodies of two girls, Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, seven, were found, side by side, 70 years ago this month. Their murders stunned the townspeople, many of whom had taken part in a search for them the day before. The girls had been gathering flowers when they were followed, attacked and beaten so severely their skulls were fractured. The bodies of the girls, both white, were found on the black side of town. Suspicion quickly fell on a 14-year-old black boy named George Stinney Jr who, it emerged, had seen the girls the previous day. What happened next has cast a long shadow over the town, the state of South Carolina and the Stinney family. Police said that Stinney confessed to the crimes and, although there was no physical evidence, he was charged with capital murder, tried, convicted and executed by the state – all in the space of 83 days. He was the youngest person to be executed by the United States in the 20th century. His siblings, three of whom are still alive, believe his confession was coerced and he was a scapegoat for a white community seeking vengeance. Attorneys for George's sisters Aime Ruffner and Katherine Robinson and brother Charles have now launched a legal bid for the verdict to be overturned. They say they were with him when the murders occurred, evidence that was never presented at his trial. Other new evidence, heard by a court in January, includes an affidavit from the Reverend Francis Batson, who found the girls and pulled them from the water-filled ditch. In his statement he recalls there was not much blood in or around the ditch, suggesting that they may have been killed elsewhere and moved. Aime Ruffner, now 77, a widow and matriarch of three generations of Stinneys whose pictures line the walls of her three-storey clapboard house in Newark, New Jersey, said she has not returned to Alcolu since her father was sacked from his job at the mill and her family were run out of town the day her brother was taken away. \\"I never went back there. I curse that place. It was the destruction of my family and the killing of my brother.\\" She will never forget the last time she saw George alive. She was eight at the time, hunkering in the chicken coop, scared half to death, when two black cars drove up to their house. Neither her mother, also Aime, a cook, nor her father, George senior, were home when white law enforcement officers came and took away George and her stepbrother, Johnny, in handcuffs. Johnny was later let go. She idolised George and followed him everywhere. He called her his shadow. Though she left the south long ago, Aime's rich, deep voice resonates with the vowels of her birthplace. But recalling her last words to George, it alters as if she's gone back in time, to the high-pitched voice of a girl. \\"I said: 'Oh George, are you leaving me? Where you going?' He told me to find Charles and Katherine and tell them he was taken away. \\"I never saw him again until he was in his casket,\\" said Aime. \\"That is something I will always see in my memories. His face was burned.\\" There is scant documentary evidence from the case, but newspapers reported that, because of his small stature, at 5ft 1in and weighing just 95lb, the guards had difficultly strapping him into a chair built for adults. When the switch was flipped and the first 2,400 volts surged through his body, the too-large death mask slipped from his face revealing the tears falling from his scared, open eyes. A second and third charge followed. He was pronounced dead on 16 June 1944. Aime gets up from her doily-covered table where, before our interview, she had been conducting her day's business, writing cheques and paying bills, and goes to the living room to find photographs. A dog yaps in another room. The television is on, a family sitcom running. She emerges with a thick poster-size print, in which a black-and-white image of George's face, taken from his prison mug shot, is surrounded by purple fluffy clouds and the words: \\"George's place is here.\\" Another photograph shows him in a cap and an overly large jacket, the same serious look on his face. From the moment he was picked up until after his trial on 24 April, the child was not allowed to see his parents. He was alone throughout and faced a jury of 12 white men, who took less than 10 minutes to deliberate as a mob of up to 1,500 people surrounded the courtroom, according to reports. Aime's parents were allowed to visit their son only once, at Columbia penitentiary, after the trial. They returned, convinced of his innocence but, as poor blacks in the south, with little recourse. \\"My mother cried and prayed,\\" said Aime. \\"We wanted the truth to come out. But sometimes when you don't have the means and the money you accept things for what they are. The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People] tried to stop it, but it was no use. In those days, when you are white you were right, when you were black you were wrong.\\" Aime and her surviving siblings, Charles who was 12 and Katherine who was 10, grew up with two beliefs: that their brother was innocent and that they couldn't change the past. In legal documents submitted to the new hearing, Bishop Charles Stinney told of how the entire family were plunged into fear after George was taken and his father fired. Amid talk of a mob, they had to leave town for their grandmother's home in nearby Pinewood and later moved to Sumter. His parents were helpless, Charles said. \\"They had no money, the law was against them and they were black in the American south in 1944.\\" Lynchings were rare by the 1940s, but memories of southern vigilantism in the 1920s and earlier were bitter. One by one, the Stinney siblings moved north and settled in New York and Newark. They rarely spoke of what happened and have only recently given detailed testimony. Charles, 83, a widower with five grown-up children, left Sumter for the Air Force before becoming bishop of the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of New York's most deprived neighbourhoods. He has spent his life trying to put it all behind him, he said, to \\"stop opening old wounds\\". As a minister, he believes God knows the truth about his brother, a sociable boy who would get friends together to sing along to the radio in the yard. \\"Nothing will bring him back and nothing will bring those girls back,\\" he said. Nevertheless \\"It is important to have his name cleared.\\" Aime sought the help of an attorney and wrote a letter to Oprah Winfrey, she said. Both approaches went nowhere. The catalyst for the legal action came via George Frierson, a local historian and a member of Clarendon's School District Three's board of trustees, who was born in Alcolu and went to elementary school when the lumber yard was still running. Frierson began investigating the case in 2004 after a small piece in a local newspaper reminded him of it. Frierson said the more he researched, the more he became convinced by George's innocence. He says there was little blood at the ditch, evidence that the girls were killed elsewhere. \\"A 95lb boy can't carry two dead bodies a quarter mile or more. Those girls were beaten to a pulp. There would have been a lot of blood.\\" His work caught the interest of Steve McKenzie and Matt Burgess, white attorneys from Coffey, Chandler & McKenzie, who took on the case for the Stinney family. McKenzie filed papers at the county solicitor in October 2013 to ask to have George's verdict overturned. He, Burgess and Miller Shealy, a professor of criminal procedure at the Charleston School of Law, presented new evidence which included sworn statements by Charles and Aime that they were with George the day the girls went missing. Wilford \\"Johnny\\" Hunter, who was in prison with George, also testified that the teenager told him he had been made to confess. Aime says her story hasn't altered in 70 years, although at the hearing she was accused by prosecutors of not remembering details of a statement she had given in 2009. She said the events of 24 March 1944, when she and George came across the girls, were so clear in her mind because \\"no white people came around\\" to the black side of town. She and George were sitting on the railroad tracks when the girls approached and asked if they knew where they could find maypops, a kind of fruit. They answered no, she said, and they left. \\"We didn't see those girls no more. But somebody followed those girls and killed them.\\" She insists that George's confession was forced out of him. \\"They made him confess. They never found the statement. Why would my brother confess to something he didn't do?\\" The confession, if it was ever written down or signed, has not survived, along with the transcript of the trial. Attempts to overturn the conviction have met with resistance among Alcolu's white community. Sadie Duke told the local paper in January 2014 that the day before the murders, George had told her and a friend: \\"If you don't get away from here and if you ever come back, I will kill you.\\" Another local, who was 15 at the time, said George was known as a bully. Asked whether she recognised this version of her brother, Aime says: \\"The only white kids that came in our area was those kids. We had our own black school and church. We didn't fool around with white people.\\" Members of Alcolu's black community say that it was unlikely that, in the segregated town, any black child would threaten white children without there being repercussions. However, back in 1995, WL Hamilton, George's seventh grade teacher, who is black, told the Item newspaper that he had a temper and had got into a fight with a girl at school, scratching her with a knife. Aime said she phoned Hamilton after she read the story. \\"That bastard. That was a damn lie. When I heard about that lie Mr Hamilton told I called him up. I said my name is Aime Stinney and you said my brother was a bad boy. You've got one foot on a banana peel and the other going straight to hell.\\" Betty June Binnicker's family never moved too far from Alcolu. A few weeks ago Frankie Bailey Dyches, Betty June's niece, helped organise a gathering of family and acquaintances to counter what she said was a false impression of George Stinney. In a restaurant outside Manning, less than five miles away, Frankie and her cousin Carolyn Geddings talk about the case over the detritus of a southern lunch of fried chicken, prime ribs, rice and gravy. Dyches and Geddings, both 62, have grown up with the grief of their mothers, Betty June's elder sisters, and their grandparents Daisy and John Binnicker. To them, George's confession, and a handwritten note from a Clarendon County deputy stating he confessed and had led them to the murder weapon – a 15in railroad spike – was proof enough of his guilt. \\"It seems like a poor little black boy was railroaded by the white people, but that's not how it was,\\" said Dyches. \\"I'm 100% convinced he did it.\\" One of the investigating officers, Mr Pratt, had told her before he died never to doubt George's guilt. \\"The stories we hear are that he was a shy bashful boy, but he was a bully and he was mean,\\" she said, citing allegations by Duke and others. She questions the memories of the Stinney family, the motivation of the attorneys and the timing of the appeal. \\"Why now? What about in the 1960s, when the civil rights movement was starting? What about in the 1970s or 80s? One was a school teacher. It's not as though they weren't educated.\\" She believes the attorneys are motivated by money, citing a website they set up, and that they will sue the state for wrongful death if George is exonerated. The lawyers say the site is for litigation fees only, with any remaining going to a scholarship foundation, have no interest in suing for wrongful death and do not know if that is even possible. Betty's parents had already lost a baby son, Harold, when he was six months old and, after Betty June, lost a third child, a son who died on duty in the Korean war. According to the family they never recovered. Carolyn added: \\"For Betty June to be killed in such a horrible way – it was a terrible time for all of them.\\" The cousins insist that there was no racial element to George's trial and conviction. But they disagree over whether the state was right to execute him. \\"I'm a believer in the death penalty if you are 100% sure and I believe he did it,\\" said Frankie. Carolyn is more sympathetic to the view that grave mistakes were made in the case. She said George should have had a lawyer or parent with him during his interrogation, and should never have been put to death. \\"I feel bad for his family, all of them,\\" said Carolyn. \\"They had to live with it, same as we have. My mother, Vermelle, didn't think he should have been electrocuted. She thought because of his age that he shouldn't. At this point, after years of this, if the judge rules it wasn't fair then I'm happy with that. I hope the family can get some peace from it.\\" In the South CAROLINA state archives in Columbia, a thick file offers an insight into the outrage the upcoming execution of a minor caused at the time. Hundreds of letters and telegrams urged the governor, Olin Johnston, to commute the sentence to life imprisonment. Some cited a recent case, where a 16-year-old white boy from Parish Island was given a 20-year sentence for murder and rape. Others begged for a new investigation and trial. Many spoke of the war, in which black and white men were fighting and dying in equal numbers for their country. Johnston, who was running for the US Senate at the time, was unmoved. In one letter, dated 14 June, two days before the execution, Johnston wrote to a VM Ford of Myrtle Beach who had asked for clemency, that he had spoken with the arresting officer. He said: \\"It may be interesting for you to know that Stinney killed the smaller girl to rape the larger one. Then he killed the larger girl and raped her dead body. Twenty minutes later he returned and attempted to rape her again, but her body was too cold. All of this he admitted himself.\\" This was rumour – and was contradicted by the physical examination at postmortem. Johnston was not the only one running for office. Charles Plowden, George's appointed defence attorney, was also running for the statehouse. Two conflicting confessions by George were entered as evidence at the trial, according to reports. In the first, he said he was approached by the girls who attacked him after he tried to help one who had fallen into a ditch and he struck them in self-defence. In the second version, he had followed the girls into the woods and first attacked and fatally wounded Mary Emma, to \\"get her out of the way\\", and then chased Betty June and struck her. The trial court allowed the permissibility of the \\"possibility\\" of rape, despite the lack of evidence. The medical report states that, while there was slight swelling and a slight bruise on the external genitalia of Betty June, the hymens of both girls were intact. The attorney Matt Burgess believes George's confession was changed to fit the prosecution. \\"The confession changed to fit the elements. The murder weapon changed. It was a piece of iron, then a spike and then a railroad spike. That changed in a manner beneficial to law enforcement. In 1944, a 14-year-old black kid interrogated by white officers… They probably put different scenarios to him. I'm guessing he just said, 'Yes sir' a lot.\\" At Sumter County courthouse in January, Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen stressed that her job was not to establish the guilt or innocence of George Stinney, who \\"may well have committed this crime\\", but to determine whether or not he received a fair trial. She said: \\"No one can justify a 14-year-old child charged, tried, convicted and executed in some 80 days.\\" The injustices, she said, included a witness who discovered the victims' bodies being allowed to sit on the coroner's inquest; a trial that lasted less than a day; a state-appointed defence lawyer, Plowden, who did not call any witnesses, ask any questions on cross-examination, offered little or no defence and filed no appeal. Mullen concluded: \\"In essence, not much was done for this child when his life lay in the balance.\\" Her ruling is expected any day. The population of Alcolu has shrunk from 1,700 in 1944 to 400 today. Aime said she has no hate in her heart \\"for no man, even the ones that killed my brother. I feel sorry for the families that lost those little ones. They lost their children and I lost a brother. That hurts. But for people to sit down and form a judgment in the way they did? To electrocute him? They burned him. It was a horrible death for a child.\\" Summary:","output":"In 1944, 14-year-old George Stinney Jr. was charged with capital murder and executed by the state of South Carolina in just 83 days, making him the youngest person to be executed in the United States in the 20th century. His surviving family believes his confession was coerced, and he was a scapegoat for a white community seeking vengeance. Attorneys for George's siblings have launched a legal bid for the verdict to be overturned, and new evidence has recently been heard in court. While some residents of Alcolu, South Carolina still consider George guilty, others believe the legal action is an important step to clear his name."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Outland Movie plot: In the future, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a tour of duty at the titanium ore mining outpost Con-Am 27, operated by the company Conglomerates Amalgamated on the Jovian moon of Io. Conditions on Io are difficult: gravity is 1/6 that of Earth's with no breathable atmosphere, spacesuits are cumbersome, and miners carry their own air supply. Shifts are long, but significant bonuses are paid. The outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), boasts that productivity has broken all previous records since he took over. O'Niel's wife Carol (Kika Markham) feels she cannot raise their son Paul on Io, fleeing with the child to the Jupiter space station to await a shuttle back to Earth. Later, a miner named Tarlow (John Ratzenberger) suffers an attack of stimulant psychosis: he sees spiders and rips open his spacesuit, resulting in his death by explosive decompression. Cane, another miner, enters an elevator without his spacesuit during another psychotic episode, and likewise dies from decompression. With the reluctant assistance of Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), O'Niel investigates the deaths. Another incident involves a worker, Sagan, who takes a prostitute hostage and threatens to kill her with a knife. O'Niel attempts to calm the man while Montone (James B. Sikking), his sergeant, sneaks in via the air duct and kills Sagan with a shotgun. O'Niel and Lazarus discover that Sagan had traces of a powerful amphetamine-type drug in his bloodstream, which would allow the miners to work continuously for days at a time, until they \\"burn out\\" and turn psychotic after approximately ten months of use. O'Niel uncovers a drug distribution ring run by a corrupt Sheppard and sanctioned by Montone. Using surveillance cameras, O'Niel finds and captures one of Sheppard's dealers, Nicholas Spota. However, before Spota can be questioned, he is murdered. Montone is then found garroted. O'Niel finds the latest shipment of drugs in a meat locker that was shipped from the space station, but is... Answer:","output":"In the movie Outland, Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) faces a significant challenge when he tries to bring down the drug distribution ring run by the outpost's general manager, Mark Sheppard (Peter Boyle), as well as his own corrupt sergeant, Montone. As a result of his investigation and attempts to expose the illegal activities, O'Niel becomes a target for several hitmen who are hired to kill him and silence further opposition. To get rid of the hitmen, O'Niel utilizes a combination of strategic thinking, his skills as a Federal Marshal, and the unique environment of the mining outpost on Io. He takes several steps to eliminate the threats and stay alive while continuing his efforts to bring down the corrupt officials. First, O'Niel uses the outpost's surveillance system to monitor the movements of the hitmen, track their locations, and gain critical information about their plans. This allows him to remain one step ahead and avoid being an easy target. Second, he capitalizes on his knowledge and experience as a Federal Marshal, using his instincts to identify potential ambushes and develop strategies to counter the hitmen's attacks. Next, O'Niel uses the environmental conditions on Io to his advantage. Due to the low gravity and lack of breathable atmosphere, the hitmen must wear cumbersome spacesuits and carry air supplies to survive. This makes them slower and more vulnerable than they would be under normal circumstances. O'Niel exploits this fact by utilizing the terrain and structures of the outpost to his advantage, setting traps and forcing the hitmen into disadvantageous positions. Additionally, O'Niel receives support from Dr. Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen), who reluctantly decides to help him in his battle against the hitmen and the corruption that is plaguing their community. Her knowledge and insight into the outpost, as well as her medical expertise, prove invaluable in aiding O'Niel. Finally, O'Niel's determination, resourcefulness, and commitment to justice help him persevere in the face of danger. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds and an enemy that includes his own allies, he remains focused on his mission and refuses to back down. Throughout these efforts, O'Niel successfully eliminates the hitmen who were sent to kill him, either through direct confrontations or by outmaneuvering them. He takes down the drug distribution ring run by Sheppard and Montone, protecting the miners and their families and holding the corrupt officials accountable for their actions. Through his courage and skill, O'Niel triumphs over the forces of greed and corruption and serves as an example of justice and integrity in a challenging and unforgiving environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It happened at a home in the 4000 block of Ascendant Drive, near North Carefree Circle and Peterson Road.      Police were originally called to the home to investigate a burglary just before 6 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013. The caller told dispatchers the burglar was shot. A little over a minute later, dispatch reports the sad news it wasn't a burglar. When police arrived, they found the 14-year-old suffering from life-threatening injuries. She died at a hospital.      Police and the District Attorney's Office are investigating.      Jani Harvey lives across the street from the family. She heard the gunshots early Monday morning.      \\"I heard three bangs,\\" said Harvey. \\"I assumed it was someone hitting on a car or a garage door or something like that.\\"      She said the noise was startling.      \\"I thought it was strange, and I thought it was an odd hour for it to be going on. It's kind of a quiet neighborhood,\\" said Harvey.      Directly next door, Mary Zesiewicz was awakened by police knocking on her door.      \\"They were making sure everyone was o.k.\\" Zesiewicz said.      After she went to work, Zesiewicz learned why police were so concerned after a phone call from her son.      \\"He goes Mom, they removed bullets from our wall...it's a very, very scary feeling,\\" Zesiewicz said.

As the chair of the presidency, our main focus will be on enhancing cooperation and collaboration among the European Union member states in the field of justice and home affairs. This is in line with the priorities of the European Commission's communication, which emphasizes improving the mutual understanding, trust, and overall effectiveness of the justice and home affairs systems within the EU. To achieve this goal, we will work closely with all EU member states, European Union institutions, and relevant stakeholders to create an effective, transparent, and robust evaluation mechanism for justice and home affairs. This evaluation system will be designed to identify best practices, detect weaknesses, and address emerging challenges in the field. In order to develop this evaluation system, our presidency has identified several key areas that we will focus on: 1. Strengthening the rule of law: We will prioritize efforts to maintain and enhance the rule of law within the European Union, including exploring ways to better monitor and assess the state of rule of law in member states. This will involve working with relevant stakeholders and institutions to create harmonized criteria, indicators, and mechanisms for evaluation. 2. Enhancing judicial cooperation: We aim to improve the efficiency of cross-border cooperation in judicial matters among EU member states, including exploring ways to streamline the exchange of information and increase the use of digital tools. Additionally, we will promote the adoption of integrated case management systems for better communication and information sharing among judicial authorities. 3. Improving the fight against organized crime and terrorism: We will promote the development of common strategies, policies, and legislative frameworks to tackle organized crime and terrorism more effectively.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders. \\"Thousands of times a year, Idahoans are victims of domestic violence. The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services. Last year's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims. The help ranged from representation in protection order hearings to legal assistance in divorce, visitation and child support cases. The donations are tax deductible.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - Copenhagen (, ); ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark. It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371. The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another small portion of the city is located on Amager, and is separated from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.  - Odense Steel Shipyard was a Danish shipbuilding company located in Odense. It was best known for building container ships for its parent group, A.P. Moller  Maersk Group, including the Mærsk E-class in 2006 which at the time were the biggest container ships in the world. The global financial crisis led to Maersk announcing its closure in 2009 and the last new ship was delivered in January 2012.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Nicolas-Henri Jardin (22 March 1720  31 August 1799), neoclassical architect, was born in St. Germain des Noyers, Dept. Seine-et-Marne, France, and worked seventeen years in Denmark as an architect to the royal court. He introduced neoclassicism to Denmark.  - Svendborg municipality is a municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") in Region of Southern Denmark on the southeast coast of the island of Funen, as well as on the islands of Drejø, Hjortø, Skarø, Thurø, and Tåsinge off Funen's southeastern shores in south-central Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 418 km², and has a total population of 59,040 (2008). Its mayor is Curt Sørensen (2010), a member of the Social Democrats (\\"Socialdemokraterne\\") political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Svendborg.  - Nyborg municipality is a municipality (Danish, \\"kommune\\") in Region of Southern Denmark on the east coast of the island of Funen in central Denmark. The municipality, including the island of Sprogø, covers an area of 278 km², and has a total population of 31,607 (2008). Its mayor is Jørn Terndrup, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Nyborg.  - Faaborg or Fåborg is an old port town located on Faaborg Fjord in Faaborg-Midtfyn municipality on the island of Funen in Denmark. By road, Faaborg is located southwest of Odense, north-northwest of Svendborg, and roughly southeast of Middelfart, depending upon the route. It has a population of 7,178 (1 January 2014). With its busy port, narrow streets and attractive old houses, the town is popular with tourists, particularly in the summer months. Faaborg was formerly the seat of Faaborg municipality. The seat of the new municipality is Ringe. Both municipalities use(d) Faaborg's medieval coat of arms.  - A manor house was historically the main residence of the lord of the manor. The house formed the administrative centre of a manor in the European feudal system; within its great hall were held the lord's manorial courts, communal meals with manorial tenants and great banquets. The term is today loosely applied to various country houses, frequently dating from the late medieval era, which formerly housed the gentry.  - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there.  - Greenland  is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island.  - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder.  - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals.  - Arable land (from Latin \\"arabilis\\", \\"able to be plowed\\") is, according to one definition, land \\"capable\\" of being ploughed and used to grow crops. In Britain, it was traditionally contrasted with pasturable lands such as heaths which could be used for sheep-rearing but not farmland.  - Aarhus (officially spelled Århus from 1948 until 31 December 2010) is the second-largest city in Denmark and the seat of Aarhus municipality. It is located on the east coast of the Jutland peninsula, in the geographical centre of Denmark, northwest of Copenhagen and north of Hamburg, Germany. The inner urban area contains 264,716 inhabitants and the municipal population is 330,639. Aarhus is the central city in the East Jutland metropolitan area, which had a total population of 1.378 million in 2016.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - Nyborg is a city in central Denmark, located in Nyborg Municipality on the island of Funen and with a population of 16,528 (as of 1 January 2014). Nyborg is one of the 14 large municipalities created on 1 January 2007. This change boosted the population of Nyborg Municipality from around 18,000 to 31,009.  - Jutland , also known as the Cimbric or Cimbrian Peninsula , is a peninsula of Northern Europe that forms the continental portion of Denmark and the northern portion of Germany. The names are derived from the Jutes and the Cimbri, respectively. Jutland's terrain is relatively flat, with open lands, heaths, plains and peat bogs in the west and a more elevated and slightly hilly terrain in the east.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Glorup is a manor house located between Nyborg and Svendborg in the south - east of the Danish island Funen . Rebuilt to the design of Nicolas - Henri Jardin and his pupil Christian Josef Zuber in 1763 -- 65 , it is considered one of the finest Baroque complexes in Denmark and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon .  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\"). They consist of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, including their associated territories (Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and the Åland Islands).  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"-  arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\"  pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.  - Funen, with an area of , is the third-largest island of Denmark, after Zealand and Vendsyssel-Thy. It is the 165th-largest island in the world. It is in the central part of the country and has a population of 466,284 (2013). The main city is Odense which is connected to the sea by a seldom-used canal. The city's shipyard, Odense Steel Shipyard, has been relocated outside Odense proper.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Svendborg is a town on the island of Funen in south-central Denmark, and the seat of Svendborg Municipality. With a population of 26,672 (1 January 2014), Svendborg is Funen's second largest city. In 2000 Svendborg was declared \\"Town of the year\\" in Denmark, and in 2003 it celebrated its 750th anniversary as a market town. By road, Svendborg is located southwest of Copenhagen, south of Aarhus, south of Odense, and east of Faaborg.  - The Faroe Islands (Irish: \\"Na Scigirí\\") are an archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland, north-northwest of mainland Scotland. The area is approximately with a 2016 population of 49,188. The islands are an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.  - Zealand is the largest (7,031 km) and most populated island in Denmark with a population of 2,267,659 (39% of Denmark's total as of January 2016).  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world.

Thomas de Maiziere expressed \\"great concern\\" over the fact that about 50,000 Albanians have asked for asylum in Germany this year, coming second only to Syrian refugees.      During a visit to Albania Friday, he said Albanians migrate to Germany to seek jobs and improve their living standards.      De Maiziere said all requests would be denied in a faster, three-week process, after Albania was included in a list of safe countries.      \\"There is no reason for Albanians to ask for political asylum,\\" he said.\\" Their country is democratic.\\"      ___      4:45 p.m.      Greek authorities say the bodies of five more migrants have been found in the eastern Aegean Sea, which hundreds of thousands have crossed in frail boats this year seeking a better life in Europe.      The coast guard said Friday that three men and a woman were found dead over the past two days in the sea off Lesbos. The eastern island is where most of the migrants head from the nearby Turkish coast, paying large sums to smugglers for a berth on overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels.      The body of another man was found Thursday off the islet of Agathonissi.      Well over half a million people have reached the Greek islands so far this year — a record number of arrivals — and the journey has proved fatal for hundreds.      ___      3:35 p.m.      The Spanish government said Friday it expects a first group of 19 refugees to arrive in Madrid on Sunday from Italy as part of a European Union relocation program.      Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters the group comprised mostly Eritreans and included many women. She said the 19 are part of a group of 50 refugees due to come for relocation.      She added that the government has approved plans for the resettlement in Spain this year of 854 refugees in countries bordering Syria.      She said this is part of plans for Spain to accept 1,449 refugees over the next two years under the EU resettlement program.      ___      1:35 p.m.      France is busing asylum-seekers from elsewhere in Europe to small towns in the French heartland, after months of criticism that French authorities weren't doing their share to take in refugees and other migrants pouring into Europe this year.      The Interior Ministry said in a statement that 18 men and one woman who fled Eritrea are being bused Friday from Italy to the Loire Valley region in western France. They are among 200 people France is taking from Italy and Greece this month, 300 next month and 400 in January, the statement said.      France has agreed to take in 30,000 refugees from around Europe as part of EU-wide agreements — compared with hundreds of thousands in neighboring Germany, and 4 million Syrian refugees taken in by Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.      ___      12:20 p.m.      They call her Nina, but no one knows her real name, where she came from or what language she speaks.      Authorities have been struggling to find out the identity of a small girl found in park in a Croatian town a month ago, believed to be a refugee who got lost in a tide of people passing through the country toward Western Europe.      Officials have invited media to take pictures of the girl, who is about three years old, in the capital of Zagreb to help locate her parents. She was found in the central town of Velika Gorica.      Croatia's Minister of Family Milanka Opacic says \\"we have been unable to figure out what language the child speaks.\\"      More than 330,000 asylum-seekers have entered Croatia since mid-September, many of them families with small children.      ___      11:55 a.m.      Thousands of refugees and other migrants are heading to the Greek mainland from the eastern Aegean islands after the country's seamen's union called off rolling 48-hour ferry strikes.      The strike, which began Monday, had stranded an estimated 25,000 people on the islands. Ferries began operating again Friday morning.      Several ships dedicated to refugees set sail from the islands of Lesbos and Chios, while others were taking ships from other islands on the regular passenger ferry service.      The ferries are heading to Greece's main port of Piraeus near Athens and the northern port cities of Thessaloniki and Kavala.      More than 600,000 people have reached Greece from Turkey so far this year. The vast majority don't want to stay, and head north through the Balkans to other, more prosperous European Union countries.      ___      11:50 a.m.      Police say they have arrested two Albanians and a Turk on smuggling charges for arranging for Turkish citizens to get into European Union countries without visas through Albania.      Police said in a statement Friday that the three were arrested at Tirana airport. They are accused of helping Turkish citizens, who need no visa to enter Albania, move on to Montenegro, Serbia and Hungary as a means of making their way to other EU countries.      They allegedly charged 3,600 euros (3,900) per person. The three face up to 10 years' imprisonment if found guilty.      Albania is not on the route of refugees and migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries heading to the European Union. The main route is from Turkey to Greek islands, then north through Macedonia and Serbia toward other EU nations.      The government says, however, it has made preparations to shelter refugees should they begin arriving in Albania during the winter.      ___      11:30 a.m.      Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has invited mayors of eastern Aegean islands bearing the brunt of the current refugee influx to Athens for an emergency meeting on how to deal with the crisis.      The meeting, scheduled for midday Friday, was also to be attended by the north and south Aegean regional governors as well as mayors and religious officials from the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Kos, Leros and Chios, and government officials.      Greece is the main gateway into the European Union for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty at home. The vast majority arrive after a short but dangerous sea journey to Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast and then head to the mainland and on to more prosperous northern EU countries through the Balkans.      Hundreds have drowned, including many children, when their overcrowded and unseaworthy boats have sunk or capsized. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A three-year-old girl, known only as Nina, was found in a park in Velika Gorica, Croatia a month ago, and authorities believe she may have become lost in the tide of people fleeing Syria for a better life in Western Europe.

Input: Article: Remember that goals are dreams with a timetable. Our goals are important for us to create what enriches our life. A very common attitude among people who are successful is that their success lies in their ability to provide themselves goals that are both numerous and exciting. When you think about your future,you are helping to feed a long-term goal of what you want to create. To realize your dreams,you must translate your vision into a series of actions you can take as soon as possible. You should be able to measure these results,to make sure they take you wherever you want. And this step should not be viewed lightly! Indeed,very few people set goals and concrete actions for themselves to achieve. Very few people note what they want to accomplish,and know each day whether they have indeed advanced in the direction of their dreams. Therefore one of the secrets that you can get results from is to write down your goals on paper first. When you give your dreams a form,they become more concrete,and you can refer to them often and easily. Whenever you read the dreams that you note down,you fill your mind with positive and motivational thoughts. Unfortunately,many people stop there. They just simply make wishes, hope and wait. These people do not bring positive difference in their lives,because that sort of behavior is just wishful thinking. Success is not at all a miracle. It depends on clear and realistic targets through serious thoughts:concrete actions and perseverance . Don't forget,your past does not determine your future. Only you now is your potential!

People in the United States honor their parents with two special days:Mother's Day, on the second Sunday in May, and Father's Day, on the third Sunday in June. These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories. Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school. Many people make their own presents. These are valued more than the ones bought in stores. It is not the value of the gift that is important, but it is \\"the thought that counts\\". Greeting card stores, florists, candy makers, bakeries, telephone companies, and other stores do a lot of business during these holidays.

C) Parents educate children to be good persons. D) Parents pass away before children grow up.","output":"D) Parents pass away before children grow up. The reasons to show love and respect for parents, as mentioned, include parents bringing up children, providing love and care, and educating them to be good and responsible citizens.

Step 2: Focus on the movie's strong points for the review to be positive. [Movie Review Start Here] Title: \\"Wonder\\" Genre: Drama/Family Director: Stephen Chbosky Main Cast: Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Jacob Tremblay \\"Wonder\\" is a film that radiates with heartfelt sentimentality, bolstered by beautifully textured storytelling by director Stephen Chbosky. A film that successfully encapsulates themes of courage, friendship, and the strength of familial bonds, it delivers a potent mix of emotions. At the crux of \\"Wonder\\" is Auggie Pullman (outstandingly portrayed by Jacob Tremblay), a boy carving his own path in life despite the physical differences that set him apart. Tremblay's performance is exquisitely empathetic and moving, drawing viewers deeply into Auggie's world. Julia Roberts offers a delicate, layered performance as Isabel, Auggie's mother, brilliantly portraying a mother's fierce protection for her child, while Owen Wilson, as Auggie's father, provides the perfect balance of humor and warmth. The narrative strength of \\"Wonder\\" is hardly a surprise given Chbosky's track record with thoughtful storytelling (author of \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\"). He has a flair for revealing profound truths within relatable life episodes using a delicate and genuine touch. The cinematography is visually engaging, and every scene is shot with care and precision to provide an aesthetically pleasing canvas. Beautifully complementing this is its warm, ambient soundtrack; it flows perfectly with the rhythm of the storyline, adding extra dimensions of feeling to an already emotionally driven movie. The storyline is carefully balanced, with fluid transitions that skillfully dissolve between serious and humorous moments, keeping the audience engaged throughout. It is rare to find a movie that resists the temptation of melodrama while dealing with sensitive issues like this- a testament to its mature script and direction. In conclusion, \\"Wonder\\" is a must-watch film, an emotional journey wrapped up in a story of triumph and acceptance. I’d rate this movie 4.5 out of 5 for its excellent cast performances, commendably executed storyline, and ability to beautifully convey emotion while promoting a powerful message. I recommend it to anyone who wants to witness heart, humor, and humanity flawlessly merged on-screen.

Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid. The pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously. The pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed. The pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region. One of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways. They are among the minority of the world’s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic. There are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) – plus a little red wine. Your fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily. Fish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals. Fruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily. Question: How long did it probably take the author to try to the Mediterranean diet?

Animal A lives in small groups of 4 or 5. Animal B however lives in very large groups and when they move around they all move at the same time. Both groups are also hunted by the same predator.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group of animal is likely more fit, animal A of B?  Hint: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding The answer to this question is:","output":"Animal B. Given the information provided, including the hint, it seems that Animal B is likely more fit because it lives in larger groups and moves in synchrony which can confuse and avoid predators. This could result in a higher survival rate compared to Animal A that lives in smaller groups with potentially less effective predator vigilance behavior."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: NEW ORLEANS -- Ex-House Speaker Newt Gingrich is spending a day among conservative activists acting like a WH'12 contender, hosting events and offering a packed ballroom a vision for the GOP he may one day lead.      Keynoting the Southern Republican Leadership Conference Thursday night, Gingrich used his nearly hour-long address to alternatively slam Pres. Obama while laying out his own vision for the future of the GOP.      \\"What the left wants to do is to say we're the 'Party of No,'\\" Gingrich said. \\"I think we should decide we're going to be the party of yes.\\"      Gingrich urged SRLC attendees to advocate for common GOP principles that closely mirror the '94 Contract with America. He said the GOP supports balanced budgets, tight controls on spending and what he called \\"the right kind\\" of health care reform. \\"There are many things that we can say yes to,\\" he said. \\"Our first answer should be, 'Let me tell you what I'm for,' and the answer should be first principles.\\"      The long-time leader of the GOP's intellectual wing still offers pointed barbs at an admin he sees as \\"the most radical\\" in the nation's history. \\"This is going to be, in economic terms, the worst administration since Herbert Hoover,\\" he said.      He offered bullets on his resume intermittently throughout his speech, reminding activists of his central role in crafting the GOP's return to the majority for the first time in 40 years -- and his role in re-electing the first GOP majority in 64 years.      His experience will play a role in the GOP's strategy to roll back the health care overhaul. But he spent a chunk of the time discussing the conversation he wants to have with conservatives and Americans over the next three years.      \\"I used to be Speaker of the House and I actually understand the legislative process,\\" he said. The \\"repeal and replace\\" message, he noted, might not succeed in '11 -- as Dems have said -- but he said that with a GOP president and a GOP Congress in '13, they will repeal all the \\"radical\\" legislation Obama has gotten through.      And given the reaction he's received, it's clear Gingrich will be a major player. He retains an almost cult following among conservative activists. At the SRLC, as he did earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Committee, he entered from the back of the hall to the '80s power ballad \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" instead of from behind the podium, reveling in the crush of supporters.      But major speeches to conservative activists aren't Gingrich's only forays into the WH'12 water. Before delivering his keynote address, Gingrich hosted his fifth campaign-style town hall event at a nearby hotel. He also met with a group of small business owners to hear their concerns over a sagging economy.      He has considered running for the WH before, but demurred. This time, Gingrich told an audience member he believes he and his wife will decide whether to make a WH bid in '11. \\"That'll [be up to] God and the American people,\\" he said.      If he decides to run, he'll have a fan base. After one event, local Tea Party leader Evan Spiceland said that Gingrich has always been the smartest of the GOP field, and that the rest have to sell themselves to activists. Before his SRLC address, several attendees expressed admiration for ex-AK Gov. Sarah Palin (R), but said they backed Gingrich because he was a more complete package. ||||| AP      NEW ORLEANS -- Newt Gingrich made a rock star's entrance at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference Thursday night, entering to a standing ovation as the song \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" blared over the speakers and lights shined out over the crowd.      When Gingrich eventually got to the podium, he delivered a self-assured address peppered with historical allusions. Democrats in Washington, he said, had put together a \\"perfect unrepresentative left-wing machine dedicated to a secular socialist future.\\"      Mr. Obama is \\"the most radical president in American history,\\" Gingrich said. \\"He has said, 'I run a machine, I own Washington, and there is nothing you can do about it.'\\"      \\"What we need is a president, not an athlete,\\" Gingrich said during a question and answer period after his speech. He added: \\"Shooting three point shots may be clever, but it doesn't put anybody to work.\\"      Gingrich discussed passage of the health care bill, saying the \\"decisive\\" election of Sen. Scott Brown sent a message that Democrats decided to ignore in order to \\"ram through\\" the bill against the wishes of the American people.      \\"The longer Obama talks the less the American people believe him,\\" Gingrich said, citing the decline in poll numbers for the health care bill as the president kept trying to sell it to the public.      Gingrich said that when Republicans take back the House and Senate in the midterm elections they should \\"refuse to fund\\" the administration's proposals, drawing huge applause from the crowd.      Add a Republican president, he said, and the goal should be to \\"repeal every radical bill\\" passed by the current administration.      Gingrich, a potential 2012 Republican presidential candidate, stressed his conception of the current administration as part of \\"secular, socialist machine.\\"      \\"On every front,\\" he said, \\"they're increasing government\\" and trying to \\"micromanage our lives,\\" raise taxes, increase government power and strip citizens of their power.      \\"This is a fundamental fight over the core definition of America,\\" Gingrich said. He told the crowd they should be talking about culture, not politics. \\"The more we make this a choice about the nature of America, the weaker they are,\\" he said.      Gingrich told a story about the Polish people when they were resisting communism, who he said came up with the slogan, \\"two plus two equals four,\\" taking it from the writings of Albert Camus and George Orwell. He said the slogan grew from the fact that the authorities can't handle the truth, tying it to what he suggested were nonsensical numbers offered by Democrats about the health care bill.      \\"There are more of us than there are of the government,\\" the former House speaker said, midway through his story about Polish resistance to communism. \\"So why are we afraid of them?\\"      Asked if he would run for president, he said he would make a decision in February 2011. He said for the moment it was important for Republicans to \\"get out and campaign this year to win this year's election.\\"      The left, Gingrich said, wants \\"to be dishonest about who we are\\" and cast Republicans as \\"the party of no.\\"      He said the GOP needs to be the party of yes -- by saying yes to a balanced budget through controlled spending, more jobs through tax cuts, reforming government, stopping people from stealing from Medicaid and Medicare, spending more on getting soldiers better equipment, and \\"the right kind of health reform\\" and energy plan.      \\"My point is, there are many things that we can say yes to, and if we would discipline ourselves to start off every conversation with...'let me tell you what I'm for,'\\" Gingrich said, Republicans will be on the right track.      Gingrich predicted that \\"this administration is going to be a catastrophic failure,\\" deeming it the worst since Herbert Hoover from an economic perspective. He pushed for small business tax cuts over government spending,      \\"Quite frankly, I'm tired of finding new ways to help people who aren't working, I want to find new ways to help people who are working,\\" he said.      Gingrich said Americans will choose Republicans in the coming elections if Republicans can frame the discussion between what they offer and what is offered by Democrats. He said President Obama had helped set the stage for a comeback with his \\"incompetence.\\"      The debate should be framed, he said, not as \\"Obama vs. Anti-Obama, but America vs. a secular socialist machine.\\"      More Coverage from the Southern Republican Leadership Conference:      Sarah Palin Fires Back at Obama, Mocks His \\"Experience\\" on Nuclear Issues      Jindal Jokes RNC Staffers Should Avoid Bourbon Street      Is This How Straw Polls are won?      \\"Evangelicals for Mitt\\" Step Into Romney Vacuum      Liz Cheney: Obama Putting America on Path to Decline      All Hotsheet Coverage of the SRLC       ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich made an energetic appearance at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, positioning himself as a potential 2021 White House contender. Gingrich delivered a keynote address, using the opportunity to criticize President Obama and share his vision for the GOP's future.  Gingrich took aim at the Obama administration, which he labelled as \\"the most radical\\" in history, comparing its economic impact unfavourably to Herbert Hoover's administration. He offered his perspective for a GOP-led future, focused on principles akin to the '94 Contract with America, including balanced budgets, tight spending controls and what he referred to as \\"the right kind\\" of health care reform.  At his appearance, he advocated for the GOP to position itself as a 'party of yes', emphasizing its support for aforementioned principles. He pledged that under a GOP president and Congress, all \\"radical\\" legislation passed under Obama would be repudiated.  Gingrich also hosted a town hall event and met with a group of small business owners to address their economic concerns. Though he had considered running for Presidency before but decided against it, he indicated to an audience member that he might make another bid for the White House. Supporters at the event, including the local Tea Party leader, voiced their admiration and support for Gingrich. The former House Speaker also outlined his perception of the Obama administration as part of a \\"secular, socialist machine\\", suggesting that it was working to increase government power, raise taxes and strip citizens of their autonomy. He emphasized that the ongoing political battle is fundamentally about defending the core principles of America. Ultimately, Gingrich predicted the failure of the Obama administration and urged Republicans to frame the debate not as \\"Obama vs. Anti-Obama, but America vs. a secular socialist machine\\".  Overall, Gingrich used the conference to make a strong case for Republican values, champion conservative ideologies, and lay the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can do this by dividing 240 by 10: 240 ÷ 10 = 24 (Divide 240 by 10) So, t = 24. There you go! The number we should put in the box (t) is 24."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another was watching the DVD that goes with this. Mrs. DeMoss read Gen 3:16 and either added \\"You will desire control over your husband\\" or her \\"Bible\\" says this! This is NOT the scripture! It says that you will desire your husband.....not desire to rule over him.

Question: When did Zahm die? Context: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.

Please answer the following question: Question: What could happen to a person if no one is around him or her?  Choices:  - feel lonely - graduate from high school - enter college - cross street - be alone  The rationale to choose \\"feel lonely\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Feeling lonely is the most appropriate answer among the given choices because it directly relates to the emotional and psychological state a person may experience when they are deprived of the company of others. Loneliness is a complex emotional response to isolation, wherein the individual's need for social interaction is unmet. With no one around them, a person may feel disconnected, neglected or uncared for, leading to them feeling lonely. Graduation from high school and entering college are milestones in a person's life that occur irrespective of whether or not they are surrounded by others. Although having a community or a support system may influence their academic experiences, these events are not dependent on the direct presence of other people. Graduation and entering college are results of a person's academic progress and not directly correlated with their social interactions. Similarly, crossing a street is a simple, daily action that can be performed without the need for others. While it may be safer, easier, or preferable to cross the street with others around, it's entirely possible for a person to perform this action independently. The presence of others does not significantly impact this activity. The choice \\"be alone\\" is not the best answer, as it only describes the physical state of the person, not necessarily the emotional impact of being alone. It is possible for an individual to be alone without feeling lonely, for instance in situations where they prefer solitude or need personal space. Being alone does not automatically result in loneliness. Therefore, among the given options, \\"feel lonely\\" is the most appropriate answer when considering the emotional and psychological ramifications of being without the company of other people. The experience of being alone without a support system or human connection can lead to significant feelings of loneliness, negatively impacting a person's mental health and overall wellbeing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators. The largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. While the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller — or any prosecutor for that matter — would ask an interview subject. \\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton. The questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query. \\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\\" Jaso said.

The trio of golf superstars will undoubtedly make for an exciting opening in one of golf's oldest and most revered tournaments.  Background on the Open Championship  The Open Championship, also known as The British Open or simply The Open, is the oldest of the four major professional golf championships. First held in 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland, the event has grown into one of the most coveted titles in the golfing world. Played on a rotational basis across a selection of links courses in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, this major event offers a unique challenge to players due to its demanding course conditions and unpredictable weather patterns. Danny Willett's Rise to Fame Hailing from Sheffield, England, 28-year-old Danny Willett earned his breakthrough moment after clinching the green jacket at the 2016 Masters Tournament. This victory not only marked his first major championship, but also made him the first English golfer to win at Augusta National since Nick Faldo in 1996. Willett's immense talent and hardworking attitude have swiftly cemented his place amongst golf's elite and made him a fan favorite in his home country. Jason Day's Reign as World Number One Australian golf sensation Jason Day currently holds the coveted title of world number one, a position he first achieved in September 2015 after winning the BMW Championship. Today, Day has racked up a total of 12 PGA Tour titles, including his triumph at the 2015 PGA Championship. As a result, the 29-year-old Australian has established himself as a dominant force in men's golf, with an impressive record at the major championships and a burning desire to solidify his legacy. Rickie Fowler's Journey to Excellence A native of California, 28-year-old Rickie Fowler has been a consistent presence at the top of world golf for several years now. Bursting onto the scene in 2010 as the PGA Tour Rookie of the Year, Fowler has since captured four PGA Tour titles and six international victories. The charismatic golfer also notably captured the prestigious Players Championship in 2015. Although Fowler is yet to clinch his first major championship, his talent and dedication make him a serious contender at every event in which he participates.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Laurens wrote thesis against slavery","output":"Yes, the sentence does follow, given the preceding text about John Laurens. As an American soldier and statesman, Laurens was known for his criticism of slavery and efforts to encourage slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers. This demonstrates that he held strong anti-slavery beliefs, and it would be reasonable to assume that he may have expressed these beliefs through written work, such as a thesis against slavery. John Laurens was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to a prominent slaveholding family. His father, Henry Laurens, was a wealthy plantation owner and merchant, as well as a leading figure in the American revolutionary movement. Despite his upbringing, John chose to pursue a different path and became a staunch abolitionist. He was educated in Europe, where his exposure to Enlightenment ideas likely contributed to his anti-slavery stance. In 1779, Laurens proposed a plan to the Continental Congress that would grant freedom to enslaved individuals who were willing to fight for the American cause. His proposal, known as the “Black Battalion Plan,” aimed to address the shortage of troops within the Continental Army and, at the same time, undermine Britain's labor-intensive plantation economy in the American South. Unfortunately, his proposal was met with strong opposition from Southern delegates, and it was ultimately rejected. Although the details of the thesis Laurens wrote against slavery are not provided in the initial sentence, it can be reasonably inferred that his written work would have reflected his abolitionist beliefs. His thesis likely presented arguments in opposition to the institution of slavery and may have proposed solutions for dismantling it. Furthermore, the fact that Laurens actively sought to recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers adds credibility to the idea that he would have also written a thesis against slavery. In conclusion, given John Laurens' known criticism of slavery and his efforts to help recruit slaves to fight for their freedom as U.S. soldiers, it does follow that he would have written a thesis against slavery. His anti-slavery activism was deeply rooted in his personal beliefs and endeavors, and expressing these convictions through a written work would have been a natural extension of his overall mission to challenge and confront the injustices of slavery."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The answer is:","output":"The answer is: The blood sugar levels drop or are low. Justification of the answer: 1. The blood sugar levels drop or are low: This is the initial event that triggers the entire process. When the body detects low blood sugar levels, it needs to restore them to maintain essential functions. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: The detection of low blood sugar levels stimulates specific cells in the pancreas, called alpha cells, to secrete the hormone glucagon. 3. The liver, in response, turns the glucagon into glucose: Glucagon acts on the liver to promote the conversion of glycogen (stored glucose) into glucose, which can be readily used by the body. 4. The liver releases glucose into the blood: The liver releases the newly formed glucose into the bloodstream to increase blood sugar levels. 5.

Please capitalize where necessary: for high percentage of mature parasites, use cultures with an initial parasitaemia of ≥10%.","output":"For high percentage of mature parasites, use cultures with an initial parasitaemia of ≥10%.  When maintaining cultures for the purpose of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites, it is important to ensure that the initial parasitaemia is at least 10%. This value signifies the percentage of red blood cells that are infected with the target parasite, such as Plasmodium species in the context of malaria research. By starting with a higher parasitaemia, researchers can increase the likelihood of observing mature forms of the parasite, such as schizonts and gametocytes, which are essential for studying their biology and developing targeted interventions. If the initial parasitaemia is less than 10%, the chances of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites decrease, as the culture may not provide a sufficient number of infection events for the parasites to undergo their developmental stages. In this scenario, immature forms, such as rings and trophozoites, may predominate, skewing the data and potentially affecting the interpretation of experimental results. To maximize the opportunity to observe mature parasites, researchers should also consider additional factors when setting up the culture, such as: 1. The age and quality of the red blood cells: Fresh and well-preserved red blood cells can enhance parasite growth and maturation. It is advisable to use blood samples that have been stored for no longer than two weeks and to ensure that they have been handled and stored appropriately. 2. The culture medium: A suitable culture medium, containing essential nutrients and appropriate buffers, will promote the growth and development of the parasites. Additionally, supplementation with human serum or serum substitutes can provide further support for parasite maturation. 3. The gas mixture: Plasmodium species require a low-oxygen environment for optimal growth. Maintaining a controlled gas mixture with appropriate levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen is essential for in vitro culture success. By capitalizing on these optimization strategies and ensuring that the initial parasitaemia is at least 10%, researchers can increase their likelihood of obtaining a high percentage of mature parasites for their studies."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ferdinand died in January 1516 and was succeeded by his mentally unstable daughter Joanna. Within a few weeks, her son proclaimed himself her co-ruler as King Charles I of Castile and Aragon. Charles had been raised in Netherlands and his affairs were mostly controlled by the Flemish noble William de Croÿ, sieur de Chièvres.  In 1517, the seventeen-year-old King sailed to Castile, where he was formally recognised as King of Castile.  There, his Flemish court provoked much scandal, as de Croÿ shamelessly sold government privileges for personal money and installed other Flemish nobles into government offices.  In May 1518, Charles traveled to Barcelona in Aragon, where he would remain for nearly two years. Here, he haggled with Aragon's slightly stronger cortes, the Generalitat, for privileges and his formal recognition as King of Aragon. Aragon managed to maintain more local control than Castile did, but mostly because Aragon was poorer and there was no point in pressing the issue for extra tax money that wasn't there to be collected. In 1519, the King's paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, died.  Charles competed with King Francis I of France to win the imperial election by aggressively bribing prince-electors.  Charles won, becoming Emperor Charles V. He left Aragon to return to Castile to raise funds to pay down the debts he had incurred in the election.  The taxes granted to Charles at a Castilian cortes in Corunna would help spark the Revolt of the Comuneros of Castile.  Of more importance for Aragon, in the summer of 1519 Charles granted his permission to the Germanies to arm themselves against the raiding Muslim fleets. While permission had previously been granted under Ferdinand, Charles was able to force the Valencian nobles to accept this decision. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums.  Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person who performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him?

What colour is the mineral Lapis Lazuli?","output":"Lapis Lazuli is a vibrant blue mineral with a rich and striking color. This beautiful gemstone has been highly appreciated since ancient times for its vivid hue, and it continues to be a sought-after material for various applications, including jewelry, decorative items, and pigments. The characteristic blue color of Lapis Lazuli can range from deep, dark blue to a lighter, more muted shade, often exhibiting shades of azure or ultramarine. This variation in color arises from the presence of the mineral lazurite, which is mainly responsible for the vibrant blue coloration. Lazurite is a complex sulfate mineral composed of sodium, calcium, aluminum, and sulfur. The specific concentration and distribution of lazurite within the Lapis Lazuli matrix determine the intensity and uniformity of the blue color. In addition to the dominant blue hue, Lapis Lazuli often contains other minerals that create a unique and beautiful visual complexity. For example, white calcite veins can be observed running through the stone, creating a marbled appearance. Moreover, the presence of golden Pyrite inclusions (iron sulfide) adds a sparkling quality to the gemstone, enhancing its visual appeal. It is important to highlight that the quality of Lapis Lazuli can vary greatly depending on its composition, geological origin, and mining conditions, all of which can affect the stone's color and texture. The finest quality stones possess an even, intense blue hue with minimal visible white calcite and a dusting of golden Pyrite inclusions, giving the stone a luxurious and captivating appearance. Stones with more calcite tend to be lighter, and those with more lazurite have a richer blue color. In summary, Lapis Lazuli is a visually striking mineral known for its rich and vibrant blue color, which results from the presence of lazurite in the stone. The specific shade of blue can vary from deep, dark blue to lighter azure shades, with the color's intensity and texture further influenced by the presence of other minerals such as calcite and Pyrite. As a result, Lapis Lazuli has been highly valued for thousands of years for its unique beauty and is still widely used today as a gemstone, decorative material, and pigment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I wasn’t even wearing my sweatshirt. So. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don’t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name. “Hey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!” I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt’s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of “try not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling”. I wasn’t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan’s. It’s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I’ve gotten from a stranger all year. Complimented on something that wasn’t even mine… Welcome to my life, everybody! According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

To do this, add 10*k to both sides of the equation to move the -10*k term to the right side: -1219 = 11*k - 1252 Step 2: Isolate the constant terms on the other side of the equation. To do this, add 1252 to both sides of the equation to move the -1252 term to the left side: -1219 + 1252 = 11*k 33 = 11*k Step 3: Solve for k.

We have this equation: -165*h = -130*h + 35. Our goal is to find the value of h. Here is what we do: 1. Look at -165*h and -130*h. We will put the h parts together. To do this, we will add the opposite of -130*h to both sides. This means we'll add 130*h to both sides. So our equation will look like this:    -165*h +130*h = -130*h + 130*h + 35 2. Now let's find what is -165*h + 130*h. Since they both have 'h', we can combine them. -165 plus 130 equals -35. So our equation becomes:    -35*h = 35 3. To find the value of h, we need to get rid of -35 that's with h. We can do this by dividing both sides by -35. This means we'll have:    (-35*h)/(-35) = 35/(-35) 4. When we divide, -35 and -35 on the left side will cancel out and we're left with:     h = 35/(-35) 5. And when we divide 35 by -35, we get -1. So:    h = -1 So the value of h is -1.

On the Origin of Species: By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress. The minority view of August Weismann, that natural selection was the only mechanism, was called neo-Darwinism. It was thought that the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance invalidated Darwin's views. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

Emily's hair was recently dyed to get the gray out, but Erin has never had grays, so","output":"she couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. The two sisters had always been very different, with Erin being the carefree and spontaneous one while Emily tended to worry about every little thing. It wasn't just their personalities that diverged; even their appearances were like night and day. Erin was a natural blonde with long, wavy hair and blue eyes, whereas Emily had always been a brunette with straight, chestnut locks and brown eyes. The hair dying incident wasn't the first time they'd had conversations about aging and appearance. As they entered their late thirties and began to approach their fortieth birthdays, time seemed to be putting its marks on them even further. Erin's face remained relatively unmarked, but Emily's worry lines were becoming more pronounced. Erin, always out to enjoy herself, delved into every new experience with gusto. She saw aging as an opportunity to grow, to become wiser, and to enjoy life's different phases. When she started seeing fine lines around her eyes, she took it as a sign of the constant laughter and joy that had filled her life. She was never shy to share her opinion with Emily, who was much harder on herself when it came to beauty and aging. Their conversation on that sunny afternoon took place in Emily's brand-new house, which she had designed with her husband, Mark. It was a beautiful colonial-style home with white columns and large windows overlooking the lush green backyard. Emily had always been a fan of interior design, and her home was a testament to her impeccable taste and attention to detail. Erin, on the other hand, had settled into a cozy beach bungalow that suited her free-spirited nature. Sitting in the beautifully decorated living room, Emily couldn't help but complain to Erin about the trials of aging. She bemoaned the gray hairs and wrinkles, wishing she could turn back time. Erin, ever the optimist, urged Emily to embrace the changes with grace. She pointed out the positive aspects of growing older, like their expanding families, successful careers, and the wealth of experiences and wisdom they had accumulated over the years. Despite her sister's enthusiasm, Emily remained unconvinced. She couldn't shake the feeling that she was losing something of value by growing older, and she wondered why Erin seemed immune to these insecurities. One evening, after another fruitless conversation with Erin about the importance of acceptance, Emily confided in her husband about her worries. To her surprise, Mark gently reminded her of how beautiful she was and expressed his love and attraction towards her, no matter their age. He shared his admiration for the way her face lit up when she laughed or when she lost herself in deep thought. He confessed that he had fallen in love with her for her soul, her intelligence, her wit, and her warmth, not just her youthful appearance. Inspired by her husband's perspective, Emily finally began to understand Erin's point of view. She started pondering the idea that beauty could go beyond just her physical appearance and that there was something timeless, more meaningful in her experiences, the love of her family, and the comfort of her marriage. As the days and weeks passed, Emily began to embrace this new outlook gradually. When she looked in the mirror, she no longer saw just the gray hairs and wrinkles but a woman who had grown and evolved over time, becoming even stronger and more remarkable in the process. Thanks to Erin and Mark, Emily had learned that true beauty lay in her relationships, experiences, and resilience, something that no wrinkle or gray hair could ever take away."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive.  - FreeDOS (formerly Free-DOS and PD-DOS) is a free operating system for IBM PC compatible computers. It intends to provide a complete DOS-compatible environment for running legacy software and supporting embedded systems.  - PTS-DOS is a disk operating system, a DOS clone, developed in Russia by PhysTechSoft.  - A disk operating system (abbreviated DOS) is a computer operating system that can use a disk storage device, such as a floppy disk, hard disk drive, or optical disc. A disk operating system must provide a file system for organizing, reading, and writing files on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations operating systems, such as versions of Microsoft Windows in use, while this definition is actually only used for older generations of operating systems.  - x86 is a family of backward compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit based 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \\"x86\\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \\"86\\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.  - DOS , short for \\"disk operating system\\", is an acronym used to describe the family of several very similar command-line computer operating systems for x86-based computers: primarily MS-DOS and PC DOS, but also DR-DOS, FreeDOS, ROM-DOS, and PTS-DOS. None of these systems were officially named \\"DOS\\", and indeed \\"DOS\\" is a general term for disk operating system.  - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use.  - Betrayal at Krondor is a DOS-based role-playing video game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line in the summer of 1993. \\"Betrayal at Krondor\\" takes place largely in Midkemia, the fantasy world developed by Raymond E. Feist in his \\"Riftwar\\" novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - MS-DOS (; acronym for \\"Microsoft Disk Operating System\\") is a discontinued operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - A-10 Tank Killer is a flight simulation computer game for Amiga and DOS platforms developed and published by Dynamix. The game features an A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft. The game was originally released for DOS in 1989 and for Amiga in 1990. Following the success of \\"Red Baron\\", version 1.5 was released in 1991 which included Gulf War missions and improved graphics and sounds. Several mission packs were sold separately. A sequel published by Sierra, \\"\\", was released in 1996.  - Silent Thunder : A- 10 Tank Killer II is a flight simulation computer game and the sequel to A- 10 Tank Killer , which was directed by Frank Evers ( CEO ) . Both games were made by Dynamix and Sierra produced Silent Thunder . It was made for Amiga and DOS platforms . In the game , the player takes the role of an American A- 10 Thunderbolt II aircraft pilot who fights in various campaigns across the world in order to keep the peace . The player character is Jack \`\` Loudmouth '' Haggart , a hotshot American pilot trying to make a name for himself in the U.S. Air Force . He starts off as a rookie pilot who steadily rises through the ranks with each military campaign he successfully completes . He takes orders from Commander Garrett , an unseen American officer who informs Haggart of his primary mission objectives . If Haggart completes a mission successfully , Garrett will praise Haggart for his efforts . However , if Haggart fails a mission , Garrett will lose his temper and either criticize or threaten Haggart . Battlefield intelligence is relayed to Haggart by an unnamed intelligence officer . Finally , there is Nightflight , another A- 10 pilot who is a good friend of Haggart 's . He plays a vital role in the first campaign of the game . There are few other Allied or enemy characters described in great detail throughout the game .  - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - DR-DOS (DR DOS, without hyphen up to and including version 6.0) is an operating system of the DOS family, written for IBM PC-compatible personal computers. It was originally developed by Gary Kildall's Digital Research and derived from Concurrent PC DOS 6.0, which was an advanced successor of CP/M-86. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including Novell DOS and Caldera OpenDOS.  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin.

Answer:","output":"Aaron Montgomery Ward, born on February 17, 1844, in Chatham, New Jersey, was a well-known American entrepreneur and businessman. As the image amward.jpg indicates, he was a distinguished individual in his time. Ward commenced his career by working in various industries, including dry goods, farming, and railroads. Through these experiences, he gained valuable knowledge and skills that would later contribute to his business endeavors. His unique vision and innovative ideas led him to establish the first-ever mail-order business, Montgomery Ward & Company, in 1872. During his time, retail stores were primarily available in urban areas, making it difficult for rural customers to access goods. Aaron Montgomery Ward recognized this gap in the market and aimed to provide a convenient solution. By creating a mail-order catalog, he brought goods directly to the homes of rural Americans, revolutionizing the retail landscape. Montgomery Ward's success laid the foundation for future mail-order businesses and transformed the way goods were consumed and distributed across America. Not only did his company break barriers for rural customers, but it also provided an opportunity for new businesses to thrive within the growing industry.

Question: Paulie finds what wounded animal while jogging? Movie title: Lost and Delirious Movie plot: When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Pauline (nicknamed Paulie) and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance. This also manifests itself in Paulie coming to Tori's rescue. For example, Paulie defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who unintentionally humiliates her when she does not understand a mathematical equation. When the three are jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal and becomes obsessed with caring for it as she believes that something untoward has happened to its parents. While Paulie tends to the orphaned falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys' school. One of the boys, Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby), flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he is interested in her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, \\"He liked my tits.\\" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, \\"And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. I'd rather stay home and do math.\\" Over time, Paulie and Tori become more...","output":"open about their relationship, and Mary becomes more comfortable with it as well. However, things take a turn when Tori's sister, Allison, visits the school and sees Paulie and Tori in an intimate moment. Afraid of how her family will react and the potential consequences of being exposed, Tori decides to distance herself from Paulie and begins dating Jake to convince her family, classmates, and herself that she is actually straight. As Paulie's love for Tori remains intense and undimmed, her emotional state suffers greatly from Tori's rejection. She starts acting out in increasingly dangerous ways, fueled by both her anguish from the heartbreak and her passionate love for Tori. This includes challenging one of the boys from the nearby school to a fencing duel, resulting in her suspension from school. During this time, Paulie continues to care for her wounded falcon, projecting her own feelings of pain and isolation onto the bird and finding solace in their shared loneliness. The falcon can be seen as a metaphor for both Paulie's character and the relationship between Paulie and Tori - fierce, wild, and beautiful, but also fragile and unable to fully heal from its wounds. Mary becomes increasingly worried about Paulie as her mental health deteriorates, and she tries to offer support and help her friend regain a sense of stability. Meanwhile, Tori struggles with her feelings and identity but continues to date Jake to maintain appearances. As tensions rise between all three girls, and Paulie's erratic behavior becomes more alarming, a confrontation occurs that leads to tragedy and heartbreak. Ultimately, \\"Lost and Delirious\\" serves as a poignant examination of the nature of love, the complexities of identity, societal pressures, and the trials and tribulations faced by young women navigating adolescence and forming their own identities.

Here is a question about this article: The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, \\"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought.\\" Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \\"personal Napoleonic one\\".

Over the years, Rebecca had immersed herself in the French way of life, frequenting local cafés, attending cultural events, and building friendships with many French people. As a result, her knowledge and familiarity with the country grew significantly. On the other hand, Erin had not been as fortunate in terms of travel opportunities and had not managed to visit France as often as she would have liked. Consequently, her understanding of the country was more limited, based mainly on what she had read in books or seen in the media rather than on personal experiences. Erin often found herself grappling with the language barrier and adapting to local customs and practices that were different from her own, which made her feel more like a foreigner in an unknown land. Despite these differences in familiarity, both Erin and Rebecca shared a genuine interest in learning about France and its rich and diverse heritage. Erin was eager to improve her French language skills and gain more insight into the country's history and traditions, while Rebecca continued to delve deeper into her passion for the French lifestyle and sought to discover even more hidden treasures in her favorite country. As their friendship grew stronger over time, Rebecca began to share her experiences and travel stories with Erin, and their mutual fondness for France turned into a bond that would knit them together for years to come. They would often dream of the day when they could both roam the streets of Paris, wine and dine in local bistros, and bask in the beauty of the Versailles Gardens, side by side.

Villa told a number of conflicting stories about his early life, and his \\"early life remains shrouded in mystery.\\" According to most sources, he was born on 5 June 1878, and named Jose Doroteo Arango Arambula at birth. His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango. Villa was a brilliant tactician on the battle field, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead.  As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa's secretary, Perez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras' former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros.  Villa's war tactics were studied by the United States Army and a contract with Hollywood was made whereby Hollywood would be allowed to film Villa's movements and 50% of Hollywood's profit would be paid to Villa to support the Revolution.  As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta's Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank's owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank's hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the hacendados (owners of the haciendas) and redistributed it to the widows and family of dead revolutionaries.  Villa's political stature at that time was so high that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper pesos at face value. His generalship drew enough admiration from the U.S. military that he and Alvaro Obregon were invited to Fort Bliss to meet Brigadier General John J. Pershing. Returning to Mexico, Villa gathered supplies for a drive to the south.  With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as Servicio sanitario), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the Division del Norte (Division of the North), the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa's troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and eventually at the heart of Huerta's regime in Zacatecas. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he accomplish anything important as governor?","output":"Yes, as governor, Pancho Villa accomplished important things. He raised money for the revolution, printed his own currency, forced the wealthy to give loans, and took land from hacienda owners to give to the widows and families of fallen revolutionaries. Villa's actions made him so popular that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper currency at face value. He also expanded and modernized his army, creating the Division del Norte, which became a powerful and feared military unit in Mexico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: to forgive that still serious problem  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The given sentence, \\"to forgive that still serious problem,\\" leans towards a negative sentiment, as it implies there is an issue present in the movie that remains unresolved. However, this negativity is slightly mitigated by the use of the word \\"forgive,\\" which implies that the reviewer acknowledges the movie's flaws but might suggest that other elements of the film compensate for this \\"serious problem.\\" To fully ascertain whether the movie review is negative or positive, it would be useful to have more context on the problem mentioned. Knowing its weight in relation to the overall movie experience can help in providing a more definite answer to the sentiment behind the review. In general, though, it is safe to say that the given sentence communicates a negative sentiment but with a possibility of forgiveness or leniency towards the movie's flaws. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the sentence: 1. The phrase \\"serious problem\\" alludes to a significant issue that persists in the movie. This creates a negative impression, signaling that the movie has flaws or shortcomings that impact the overall viewing experience. 2. The word \\"still\\" suggests that this problem has not been resolved, even after a certain period or despite changes made in the film. This compounds the negative sentiment, as it emphasizes that the issue has persisted. 3. The use of \\"forgive\\" implies that the reviewer might be willing to overlook the problem despite its seriousness. This has a slightly positive connotation, as it suggests that other elements in the movie might be strong enough to compensate for the serious problem mentioned. In conclusion, while the sentence primarily has a negative sentiment, there is room for forgiveness and potentially positive elements in the movie. More context would be needed to fully understand the review's overall sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Article: Egyptian researchers believe they have recognized the mummy of Hatshepsut, the most famous queen to rule ancient Egypt, found in an average tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. Researchers said the mummy was one of two females found in 1903 in a small tomb believed to be that of Hatshepsut's nurse, Sitre In. In fact, there has been the idea over the years that one of the mummies may be that of the queen, who ruled from between 1503 and 1482 BC - at the height of ancient prefix = st1 /Egypt's power. The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas  _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

Options: A: was the only queen ever ruling Egypt B: died of cancer and diabetes C: lived between 1503 and 1482 BC D: was buried together with her nurse A:","output":"According to the passage, the correct answer would be C: Hatshepsut lived between 1503 and 1482 BC. The information provided in the article mentions that Hatshepsut, the most famous queen who ruled ancient Egypt, ruled from between 1503 and 1482 BC - at the height of ancient Egypt's power. Option A states that Hatshepsut was the only queen ever to rule Egypt, which is incorrect since the article refers to her as \\"the most famous queen\\" and not the only queen to rule Egypt. It implies that there were other queens as well. Option B mentions that Hatshepsut died of cancer and diabetes.

The article does not explicitly confirm the cause of Hatshepsut's death. Option D suggests that Hatshepsut was buried with her nurse. Even though the two mummies were discovered in a tomb believed to belong to Hatshepsut's nurse, the text does not confirm that they were buried together.

Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, estimates of Gulag victims ranged from 2.3 to 17.6 million (see a History of Gulag population estimates section). Post-1991 research by historians utilizing archival materials brought this range down considerably. According to a 1993 study of archival Soviet data, a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. However, taking into account the fact that it was common practice to release prisoners who were either suffering from incurable diseases or near death, a combined statistics on mortality in the camps and mortality caused by the camps gives  a probable figure around 1.6 million. In her recent study, Golfo Alexopoulos made an attempt to challenge this consensus figure by encompassing those whose life was shortened due to GULAG conditions. The GULAG mortality estimated in this way yields the figure of 6 million deaths. Historian Orlando Figes and Russian writer Vadim Erlikman have posited similar estimates. Alexopoulos estimate, however, is supported by indirect and misinterpreted evidences, and has obvious methodological difficulties.

Answer this question: when did the first flat screen come out??","output":"The first flat-screen displays emerged in the mid-20th century, but it was not until the early 1990s that flat-screen technology became more widely available for consumer use. Flat-screen displays represent a significant departure from the traditional cathode-ray tube (CRT) technology that dominated the television and computer monitor industry for decades. There are two main types of flat-screen displays: liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma display panel (PDP). LCD technology was invented by Austrian chemist Otto Lehmann in the late 19th century and was initially used for research purposes. However, it wasn't until 1968 that George H. Heilmeier, an engineer at RCA Laboratories, developed the first LCD display using various liquid crystal structures to control light transmission properties. Working with his colleagues Louis Zanoni and Lucian Barton, Heilmeier unveiled an early prototype in 1970. RCA produced the first commercially available LCD–based display products in the 1970s, which were mostly calculators and digital watches. Meanwhile, plasma display technology was conceived by two researchers at the University of Illinois, Donald Bitzer and H. Gene Slottow, in 1964. The idea behind PDPs is the excitation of plasma gas to create visible light. In 1967, Bitzer and Slottow demonstrated the first monochrome plasma display. However, it would take another two decades for companies to refine and produce full-color PDPs for commercial use. In the early 1990s, flat-screen technology began making its way into the consumer market as laptop computers incorporated LCD screens. Meanwhile, plasma displays started appearing in public spaces, such as airports and sports venues. In 1997, Philips and Sony released the first flat-screen televisions using plasma technology. A year later, Sharp Corporation and Sony released the first large LCD TVs, ranging from 28 to 37 inches. As flat-screen technology continued to develop, both LCD and plasma TVs grew in popularity. In the early 2000s, LCDs began to overtake CRTs as the preferred display technology for computer monitors, and by the mid-2000s, flat-screen TVs became more affordable and commonplace in households worldwide. Their slim and lightweight designs, improved image quality, energy efficiency, and adaptability made them highly attractive to consumers. By the late 2000s, LCD overtook plasma as the leading flat-screen technology due to lower manufacturing costs, better energy efficiency, and a more extensive range of sizes. In recent years, LCD technology has evolved to include LED-backlit displays and OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) panels, offering even better image quality, color accuracy, and energy efficiency. Flat-screen displays have revolutionized the way we consume visual media, and their evolution is a testament to the continuous improvements in modern technology throughout the past few decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Information:  - Bruce Eugene Carver (May 4, 1948  December 28, 2005) was a co-founder of video game developer Access Software (later renamed Indie Built) in 1982. It began by producing titles for 8-bit computers, including \\"Beach-Head\\", \\"\\", \\"Raid over Moscow\\" and many others.  - 10th Frame is a ten - pin bowling simulation game created by Access Software in 1986 , as a follow - up to the hugely successful Leaderboard golf game . Up to eight players could take part in open bowling or a tournament . There was a choice of 3 different difficulty levels - Kids , in which the ball always went straight , Amateur , and Professional .  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Leaderboard is a series of golf simulation video games that was developed by Bruce Carver and Roger Carver, and published by Access Software.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which '10th frame' exhibits the relationship of 'developer'. Find the answer from the choices below.  Choices: - access  - bruce carver  - indie built  - produce A:","output":"The entity with which '10th frame' exhibits the relationship of 'developer' is Access Software. Bruce Eugene Carver, one of the co-founders of Access Software, was involved in the development of \\"10th Frame\\". The game, a ten-pin bowling simulation, was created by Access Software in 1986 as a follow-up to their highly successful Leaderboard golf game. Access Software was initially established in 1982 and started its venture by creating titles for 8-bit computers. This included games like \\"Beach-Head\\", \\"Raid over Moscow\\", amongst others. Later on, the company was rebranded as Indie Built. However, at the time when '10th Frame' was developed, the company operated under the title of Access Software. Access Software, as a well-recognized video game developer, was known for its innovation in the field. A video game, by definition, is an electronic game that involves user interaction to generate visual feedback on display devices like a TV screen or computer monitor. These games can produce two- or three-dimensional images, creating an immersive experience for the players. The development of a game like '10th Frame' entails numerous stages ranging from initial concept development, programming, character design, data input, testing, to the final release. The complexity of the process reflects the technical and creative considerations in game development, highlighting the role of a developer like Access Software. So, based on the information provided and understanding of the video game development process, '10th Frame' holds the 'developer' relationship with 'Access Software'. It's essential to note that Bruce Carver, although a co-founder of Access Software and key figure in its initial development projects, is an individual entity separate from the development company itself. Similarly, Indie Built is Access Software's subsequent name after rebranding, and 'produce' is associated with the process, not the entity. Hence, these choices don't represent the 'developer' relationship with '10th Frame'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? from the following article ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

The ease of understanding the lottery rules and regulations makes it an attractive option for individuals looking to try their luck. 2. Wide accessibility: The lottery is widely accessible in many countries, and tickets can often be purchased at local convenience stores, gas stations, and other authorized dealers. Furthermore, the advent of internet technology has allowed individuals to buy lottery tickets online from the comfort of their own homes, further increasing the accessibility for participants. 3. Frequency of draws: Most lotteries hold drawings on a regular basis, with some offering daily, weekly, or monthly drawings. This frequency ensures that players have plenty of opportunities to try their luck, thus keeping them engaged and maintaining a steady interest. 4. Low-cost entry: Generally, lottery tickets are relatively inexpensive, making them an affordable method for gambling enthusiasts to participate in the game without having to invest a large sum of money. The low cost of entry allows a broader range of participants, from those on a tight budget to individuals looking to play casually. 5. Large jackpots and attractive prize pools: Lotteries often offer substantial jackpots and various prize tiers, with some games having multi-million-dollar prizes up for grabs. These large payouts can attract a wide range of participants, including those who may not usually be drawn to gambling. The chance to win life-changing amounts of money adds an enticing element to participation in lottery games. 6. Contribution to charitable causes: In many cases, a portion of lottery proceeds is used to fund charitable or social programs. This fosters a sense of goodwill among participants who can feel assured that their money is being used for a greater social purpose. 7. Social aspect: Lastly, the lottery can be a fun and exciting way for friends, family members, and co-workers to bond by pooling together funds to purchase tickets and discussing their plans if they happen to win the jackpot.

Hong Kong protesters in standoff with police Dozens of pro-democracy protesters were in a standoff with a large number of riot police near Hong Kong’s government headquarters on Tuesday night. Television stations showed hundreds of police wearing helmets and holding shields and batons facing off with student-led protesters, who have occupied key roads and streets in Hong Kong’s business district for more than two weeks. The two sides have been locked in a stalemate after the government called off negotiations last week. It was not immediately clear what caused Tuesday night’s standoff, but local television reports said it began when police arrested a protester. Some demonstrators then tried to take over a tunnel in front of the government headquarters near the entrance to the office of the city’s leader. The reports said police used pepper spray to try to disperse the protesters but then retreated, leaving the tunnel in the hands of the protesters, who were building barricades to expand the occupied area. Earlier, police cleared barricades from the pro-democracy protest zones, signalling authorities’ growing impatience with the activists. Officers used electric saws and bolt-cutters to take down bamboo scaffolding in the Admiralty area, after a mob of masked men stormed some of the barricades the day before. Police also removed metal barricades from another protest camp on a road in the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area to free up a lane for traffic. Police said they would continue to take down barriers, and said officers arrested 23 men on Monday when masked men and taxi drivers led a crowd of several hundred who tried to charge the protest zone. The protesters want China’s government to drop plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory’s first direct elections, promised for 2017. They also demand that Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, resign. Leung has said there is “almost zero chance” that China’s government will change its rules for the 2017 election. The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organisers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used teargas on 28 September to disperse unarmed protesters. Numbers have since dwindled and the remaining demonstrators, sensing that the earlier actions were aimed at testing their defences, are braced for possible further police moves to clear out their camps. Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist party’s monopoly on power.

Summarize this article: You will want as many sturdy boxes of different sizes as you can find. Cardboard boxes can be obtained for free from membership warehouse stores, liquor stores, furniture stores, discount stores, copy shops, toy stores, or grocery stores. Cardboard tubes can be salvaged from paper towels, wrapping paper, mailing tubes, and bolts of fabric. It is important  to pick appropriate materials for your cat.  For example, if your cat likes to chew cardboard, don't use tape or glue. Pick the materials according to whether you want to be able to disassemble some or all of the boxes after you are finished or whether you want some or all of the boxes to be permanently connected. Think about a shape that would fit well in your house and would provide comfort and entertainment to your cat. Decide whether you want different \\"rooms\\" to have different purposes: you might build an observation deck, for instance, and designate one room for sleeping and hiding, and one room for snacking.  Take the future location of your structure into account. If it is by a window, you will want the cat structure to have plenty of windows, and you will want to build it so that it does not block your light. You might choose to build next to a wall that will provide support, or it may be freestanding, in which case you will need to reinforce your structure. Experiment with different ways of arranging the boxes:  Put some boxes inside of others.  Connect two or more groups of boxes using single, long boxes as tunnels or bridges.  Make steps using a series of smaller boxes. Experiment with different size windows, doors, and trap doors.  Draw windows, doors, or trap doors first before cutting. Do not build your jungle gym more than four levels high. The higher you build your jungle gym, the wider the base should be in each direction. Make an exit plan. While designing your jungle gym, make an \\"emergency hatch\\" so that you can access your cat without completely tearing apart and destroying the jungle gym.  This is important when you need to give your cat medicine or take them to the vet. If you have multiple cats, you will want to be able to remove them in case they are fighting inside their new space. If your cats are new or if they are needy, they may decide they are trapped and need to be rescued. Design multiple exits in each box so your cats cannot corner one another. Use cardboard tubes as support posts in vertical structures. Cardboard tubes can also be used to create see-saws; fold one or two in half and place inside another for stability, then tape the tube to the bottom of a long, narrow box with holes cut into it. Kittens especially will be entertained by the unexpected rocking as they move from one end to another. It is easiest to do this in the room where the play equipment will stay.  After it is assembled, it can be difficult to maneuver play equipment around corners, up or down stairs, or through doorways. Connect the boxes by building tunnels out of smaller boxes, and by gluing and taping everything in place.  Make it sturdy. If you build the play equipment more than a couple of boxes high, you will need to reinforce the first couple of levels with something like cut pieces of cardboard. Cut cardboard to fit along the sides of each box and wedge it into the corners. Reinforce the floors and roof of the boxes with flat pieces of cardboard. Check for safety before you let your cats play on the structure. Try kicking and shaking your structure to test its sturdiness. Place objects the weight of your cat or cats together in each section of the structure to make sure it will hold them easily. Add soft surfaces to make the play equipment comfortable for your cat.  Use materials that can be removed for cleaning. Cat size pillows can be made from old socks, potholder mitts, pillowcases, hand towels, shirts, or curtains. Sew up all but one side of your cloth, then stuff with cotton or other washable material and sew closed. Stuff socks with catnip, or tie knotted rope so it dangles. Be sure to avoid toxic materials and choking hazards.  Add a flutter \\"curtain\\" over a window or doorway for your cat to bat. If your cat likes mirrors, try gluing one to a box's inside wall. Your cat might not instantly be attracted to its new toy. Catnip placed inside could break the ice. Put familiar toys or blankets inside the entrance room to encourage your cat to explore. Try temporarily placing your cat's food dish inside the cat house. If the structure isn't appealing where it is, try moving it nearer a window or under a sunbeam. Cats may ignore a structure for days or even weeks before they try it out. Give them time. Watch your cats as they enjoy their jungle gym to learn what they like and what elements of your design work best. Eventually each cardboard jungle gym will start to sag and wear out. Use your observations to design your next cat jungle gym.","output":"The article provides tips on creating a cardboard jungle gym for cats using sturdy boxes of different sizes and cardboard tubes.

Glucose: It's a simple sugar (monosaccharide) and an essential component of many carbohydrates. More importantly, it's the primary source of energy for our body's cells. Through a metabolic process called cell respiration, the body converts glucose into a usable form of energy (ATP). Almost every species on earth uses glucose for energy. The food we eat, whether it comes directly from plant-based sources or indirectly from animal-based sources, eventually breaks down into glucose in our body. Therefore, if we consider the energy used within the human body itself, much of that could be attributed to glucose. 2. Grasses: While not directly consumed, grasses or more specifically, grains (which botanically are a type of grass) supply most of the world's dietary energy. Major grains including rice, wheat, and corn, collectively provide over 50% of the caloric intake of humans worldwide. They are the primary source of carbohydrates which our body breaks down into glucose for energy. These crops have been cultivated for thousands of years and are a dietary staple in most societies. Therefore, much of the 'physical' energy that humans consume for sustenance and survival can be traced back to these grasses. Contrasting with above, heat, light, coal, and gasoline are sources of energy, but they are used mainly for industrial, transportation, and household purposes (like heating, running machinery, vehicles, electric supply etc.), not directly for human physiological functions or food. Cooking is a process that uses energy (generally in the form of heat) rather than a source of energy. A computer and other electronic devices also consume energy, specifically electrical energy, but it's minor in comparison to the global energy consumption. However, if the perspective of the question extends to all forms of energy, including industrial and transportation energy, then the answer would be different. As of current statistics, coal, followed by gasoline (or more broadly, oil), would constitute the greatest part of the energy mix. Rest of the options, like heat and light, are types of energy but not energy resources. They are usually the output or result of using an energy resource."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"The last step of the process is the delivery of oxygen to body cells and tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, cells convert oxygen and nutrients (mainly glucose) into carbon dioxide, water, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of energy for cells. The carbon dioxide produced as a waste product is then transported back to the lungs by the bloodstream, where it is eventually expelled from the body during exhalation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and old electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country.    Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place. \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later,\\" Lauren Roman, managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech trash is produced each year in the US.    What's behind the tech trash pile-up? About ten years ago, major advances were made in computer and television technology. Manufacturers began producing devices like flat-paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy, glass-based technologies.    The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs.    CRTs have a high lead   content and can be environmentally risky if not recycled properly. If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CRTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors.    Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes. \\"People are returning old-style TVs with CRTs, but no new ones are being made,\\" said Linnel. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process... Question: What is the main idea of the passage? - New technologies cause trouble for recyclers. - Experts are trying to solve the tech trash problem. - New technology has both advantages and disadvantages - CRTs from old computer monitors harm the earth.

I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999.

Short movie review: hated myself  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the phrase \\"hated myself\\" mentioned by the critic, it is evident that their thoughts about the movie are negative. The word \\"hated\\" conveys a strong negative sentiment towards the movie. It indicates that the critic either did not enjoy the movie or found some aspects of it deeply disappointing or uncomfortable, which consequently led to negative self-reflection or self-dislike. A more elaborate interpretation would suggest that, by saying \\"hated myself,\\" the critic might have experienced either one or more of the following: 1. Regret or frustration for deciding to watch the movie, possibly due to time wasted or disappointment in the film’s content, plot, or execution. 2. Discomfort or emotional distress caused by the movie’s subject matter, which elicited a sense of self-loathing or even guilt in the critic. 3. Negative identification with the film or its characters, which contributed to the critic's unfavorable personal response to the movie. 4. Dissonance between the critic's personal values, beliefs, or tastes, and the movie's themes, messages, or stylistic choices, which resulted in a negative experience for the critic. Independently of the other potential reasons behind the critic's words, it is quite clear that their view of the movie is decidedly negative.

How do clothing store employees feel when a customer tries on a lot of clothes but leaves without buying anything? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"1. At some clothing retail stores, employees might be asked to wear the company's clothing while they work. This is because the store wants the employees to look nice and show off the clothes they sell. It's kind of like having walking models in the store! But not all stores have this requirement. Sometimes, employees can wear clothes from other places, as long as they follow the store's dress code. 2. When a customer tries on many clothes but doesn't buy anything, clothing store employees might feel a little disappointed or sad. They might think their hard work in helping the customer did not result in a sale. However, they understand that not everyone will buy something every time, and they will still do their best to be helpful and friendly in case the customer comes back in the future. 3.

Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another.

As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt.

Today the island is located in the historic core of the central Mitte locality of modern Berlin. Its northern peak is known as Museum Island, while the part south of Gertraudenstraße is called \\"Fischerinsel\\" (Fisher Island).  - Museum Island is the name of the northern half of an island in the Spree river in the central Mitte district of Berlin, Germany, the site of the old city of Cölln. It is so called for the complex of five internationally significant museums, all part of the Berlin State Museums, that occupy the island's northern part: In 1999, the museum complex was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.

The goal of the experiment was to identify the strength of unknown acids by examining the products formed in a chemical reaction. After they completed the experiment, Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, while Thomas concluded that he was given a weak acid.  But I can use this background: The stronger of two acids will have a higher Ka than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for Ka spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, pKa is more frequently used, where pKa = −log10 Ka. Stronger acids have a smaller pKa than weaker acids. Experimentally determined pKa at 25 °C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.  What is an answer for this question: Which person's acid, Jacob's or Thomas's, will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Jacob's acid will have a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid. This is because Jacob concluded that he was given a strong acid, which means it has a higher Ka (acid dissociation constant) compared to the weak acid that Thomas concluded he has. A higher Ka indicates a greater tendency for the acid to lose a proton (H+) and form the conjugate base. Since a stronger acid has a higher Ka, it also has a smaller pKa value (pKa = -log10 Ka). Therefore, the stronger acid (Jacob's) will have a greater concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) relative to the acid molecule itself, resulting in a lower ratio of hydrogen ions to acid when compared to the weaker acid (Thomas's)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","output":"Title: Embracing Womanhood: The Power of Mindset and Personal Growth Introduction Embracing womanhood requires much more than just growing older or reaching specific milestones. Womanhood is a mindset, and it can encompass a range of experiences, personal growth, and self-awareness. Empowered women are active participants in their life journey, and they continuously push the boundaries of what it means to be a woman in today's society. In this article, we will explore different ways to nurture a woman's mindset, personal growth, and overall well-being. 1. Being a Woman is a Mindset The first step in embracing your womanhood is to understand that being a woman is a mindset. Recognize that this mindset encompasses both physical and emotional traits, and it calls for openness, courage, and resilience in the face of life's challenges. Tell yourself that being a woman means embracing these qualities, and be proud of who you are. 2. Read Coming-of-Age Books by and about Women Reading coming-of-age books can provide valuable insights into the lives and experiences of other women. These books tell stories of personal growth, identity, and self-discovery, and they can teach us essential lessons that help us navigate our own paths to womanhood. So, pick up a few books, immerse yourself in the lives of inspiring women, and learn from their struggles and triumphs. 3. Learn Appropriate Social Skills and Behaviors Developing social skills and displaying appropriate behavior are essential parts of embracing womanhood. As a woman, understanding the nuances of communication, empathy, and effective problem-solving can enhance your relationships and improve your overall well-being. Make it a point to learn and practice these skills, as they will shape the way you interact with people and the world around you. 4. Act with Confidence A major aspect of embracing womanhood involves acting with confidence. Confidence allows you to express yourself authentically, make decisions in line with your values, and feel secure in your identity. To cultivate confidence, consider surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, take advantage of opportunities to challenge yourself, and be unapologetically you. 5. Learn About the World Expanding your knowledge of the world around you can have a profound impact on your personal growth and understanding of yourself as a woman. Travel, engage with diverse communities, or educate yourself on global issues to build a stronger connection with the world and develop a more comprehensive view of your own place within it. 6. Take Part in a Coming-of-Age Ritual Partaking in a coming-of-age ritual can provide a symbolic transition into womanhood. Consider creating your own ritual or engage in cultural or religious practices that resonate with you. Coming-of-age rituals can serve as a reminder of your personal growth and provide an opportunity to reflect on your journey thus far. 7. Make Goals for Yourself and Live Up to Them Setting and working towards personal goals is an essential part of embracing your womanhood. Reflect on your values and aspirations, and identify goals that will help you develop personally, professionally, and emotionally. Ensure that your goals align with your overarching vision of yourself as a woman, and commit to taking small steps each day to bring you closer to realizing these ambitions. Conclusion Embracing womanhood necessitates a mindset that encompasses personal growth, self-awareness, and a dedication to experiencing life to the fullest. By reading about the experiences of other women, honing social skills, acting with confidence, learning about the world, taking part in coming-of-age rituals, and setting personal goals, you can cultivate an empowered sense of womanhood that will shape your life for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Simon Zebo and James Sherry tries saw Munster lead 14-6 but Niki Adeolokun's score and a penalty try helped Connacht move ahead 20-14 by the interval. Adeolokun and Finlay Bealham added touchdowns after the break, while Shane O'Leary kicked a total of 15 points. The result effectively ended Munster's hopes of a semi-final play-off place. They are seventh in the table and face a battle to secure a berth in the Champions Cup next season. Connacht, who leapfrogged Glasgow, completed a season double over their Irish interprovincial rivals for the first time, and a spot in the last four of the competition now appears certain. Victory came as a boost to Pat Lam's men after Ulster ended their six-match unbeaten run in the competition, followed by a 33-32 defeat by Grenoble in the last eight of the European Challenge Cup. A stray Munster hand in the ruck allowed O'Leary to put Connacht ahead after eight minutes, but Zebo - Munster's record try-scorer - went over on his 100th appearance. Although O'Leary reduced the deficit to one point with a penalty, Munster's superb driving maul left Connacht scrambling backwards, and hooker Sherry touched down. With Anthony Foley's side down to 14 men after James Cronin saw yellow, Connacht made their numerical advantage count. The superb Bundee Aki burst through Munster's scrambled defensive line before moving the ball to Finlay Bealham, who sent Adeolokun racing under the posts. O'Leary's easy conversion brought Connacht within a point again. Foley's men found themselves under severe pressure at the scrum and, when Billy Holland was sent to the sin-bin, Connacht made no mistake with a two-man advantage in the pack. Referee Ben Whitehouse marched Munster under the posts for a penalty try that O'Leary converted for a six-point half-time lead. When Robbie Henshaw dropped a cute kick in behind Munster, Adeolokun profited from an awkward bounce to touch down, although O'Leary missed the conversion. Ultan Dillane's powerful carry put Connacht on the front foot deep in opposition territory and, when the ball was recycled, Bealham ran over. O'Leary followed up the conversion with a penalty with the last kick of the game. Connacht: R Henshaw; N Adeolokun, B Aki, P Robb, M Healy; S O'Leary, K Marmion; D Buckley, T McCartney, F Bealham; U Dillane, A Muldowney; S O'Brien, E McKeon, J Muldoon (capt).

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: What did the actor do for a living after getting rejected for the play with the even larger theatre?

Paragraph: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"Who are the four jihadists that arrived in Kandahar in 1999\\" Answer: \\"Bin Laden\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, this answer is not correct. The four jihadists that arrived in Kandahar in 1999 were Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah.

Further inland was the Illyrian Paeonian Kingdom and the tribe of the Agrianes which covers most of the modern republic of Macedonia. Illyrians on the coast of the Adriatic were under the effects and influence of Hellenisation and some tribes adopted Greek, becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the Greek colonies in Illyria.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine.

I can use this background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Input: The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) is out with its “Hot Wheels” list of the most stolen cars in the United States during 2016. The list is led by Honda Motor Co. Ltd.’s (NYSE: HMC) Accord. However, thieves have not been snatching new models. The 1997 Accord is the most stolen version.      In fact, of the 10 most stolen cars, seven are 2008 or earlier models. Another example of this is that the second most stolen car is the Honda Civic — the 1998 model. Third on the list is the 2006 model of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) full-sized pickup.      The list closely matches the top 20 best-selling cars of today. As a matter of fact, the overlap of the 10 most stolen cars to the top 20 selling cars of the first half is a match of nine out of 10. These are the Civic, Accord, Ford full-size pickup, Chevy full-size pickup, Camry, Altima, Corolla, Dodge full-size pickup and Jeep Cherokee/Grand Cherokee.      The NICB commented:      While Honda Accords and Civics dominate this annual list, they are older, pre-“smart key” production models. Since the introduction of smart keys and other anti-theft technology, Honda thefts have fallen precipitously. As the list of top 25 most stolen 2016 model year vehicles shows, there were only 493 thefts of Accords last year. Technology is working, but complacency can defeat it. While thefts are down dramatically since their all-time high in 1992, thousands of vehicles continue to be stolen each year because owners leave their keys or fobs in the vehicles and that invites theft.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing.

Article: If you can see the magic in a fairytale, you can face the future.\\" --Danielle Steel Who have not read fairytales? We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds. Fairytales are narrated to... Question: By saying \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\", G. K.

What is the answer for the question: What was built to reinforce a weak point in the defences of the castle? from the following article ?  The current entrance in the north-east occupies the approximate location of the main gatehouse constructed by Gundulf and then rebuilt during 1249–1250. It was pulled down in the 1870s when the enclosure was converted into a municipal garden. An engraving from 1735 by the Buck brothers gives some indication of the gatehouse's form: the gate was an archway between two towers projecting from the curtain wall. It was reached by a stone causeway across a ditch, rather than a drawbridge. A tower containing a postern gate was located in the north-west corner of the enclosure, built at the close of the 14th century to guard the bridge over the Medway. The tower and postern no longer stands, but 19th-century antiquary and engineer G. T. Clark made some notes on the structure while it was still standing and commented that it had mechanisms to lift supplies for the castle from the river. The western part of the stone outer wall, a stretch facing the river, dates from when Gundulf built the first wall enclosing the castle. In the 19th century a revetment was added to strengthen the decaying wall. Like the keep, it was constructed using Kentish Ragstone. This part of Gundulf's wall was 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick at the base, narrowing to 2 feet (0.61 m) at the top; it rose to a height of around 22 feet (6.7 m). Four embrasures were added to this part of the wall in the 13th century, although the builders imitated Norman design. At the northern end of the 12th-century stretch of western wall are the remains of a building, probably a hall, dating from the 13th century. Although no longer standing, it is known it had a vaulted undercroft.In the south Gundulf's wall survived into the modern period, although has now been dismantled. The current wall is a 19th-century replacement. At the eastern end of this wall, near the southern corner of the castle, is a two-storey rounded tower 30 feet (9.1 m) in diameter dating from the early 13th century. It was built to fill the breach in the curtain wall caused when John's army besieged...

Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \\"lay cardinals\\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals. Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"According to Pope John XXIII, one cannot ascend to a cardinal position without first holding the office of a bishop. This requirement was established to ensure that those appointed as cardinals have the necessary ecclesiastical experience, knowledge, and authority to hold such a significant position within the Catholic Church. The context provided gives a historical background of cardinals appointed in various times. In the past, there were cases where individuals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders, but were not yet ordained as deacons or priests, were appointed as cardinals. These clerics were inaccurately referred to as \\"lay cardinals,\\" and they were even allowed to marry. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was one of the last lay cardinals, marking the end of an era when cardinals were not necessarily ordained priests. The revision of the Code of Canon Law in 1917, promulgated by Pope Benedict XV, brought about a significant change in the criteria for appointing cardinals. The revised law stated that only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed as cardinals. This notable shift in policy aimed to ensure that cardinals would have the appropriate clerical background and qualifications to effectively carry out their responsibilities within the Church. Continuing this progression, Pope John XXIII further refined the requirements for becoming a cardinal. He determined that a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop unless a dispensation, or exemption, is granted. This decree reinforces the importance of having an experienced and authoritative figure in the cardinal position, as bishops possess the highest order of the sacrament of Holy Orders and are entrusted with the administration of the sacraments and the governance of the Church. In conclusion, Pope John XXIII made it a requirement for a priest to be consecrated as a bishop first before ascending to a cardinal position, unless a dispensation is obtained. This rule highlights the importance of having experienced, knowledgeable, and authoritative individuals in the cardinalate to ensure that the complex duties and responsibilities of the position are effectively carried out. The historical progression, from having \\"lay cardinals\\" to requiring cardinals to be bishops, demonstrates the evolving nature of Catholic Church leadership and the criteria associated with its highest-ranking officials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The park was designated in 1954, and was extended in 2016. Over 20,000 residents live and work in the park, which attracts over eight million visitors every year.  - The River Aire is a major river in Yorkshire, England, in length. In the \\"Handbook for Leeds and Airedale\\" (1890), it notes that the distance from Malham to Howden is direct, but the river's meanderings extend that to . Part of the river below Leeds is canalised, and is known as the Aire and Calder Navigation.  - The Aire and Calder Navigation is a river and canal system of the River Aire and the River Calder in the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, England. The first improvements to the rivers above Knottingley were completed in 1704 when the Aire was made navigable to Leeds and the Calder to Wakefield, by the construction of 16 locks. Lock sizes were increased several times, as was the depth of water, to enable larger boats to use the system. The Aire below Haddlesey was bypassed by the opening of the Selby Canal in 1778. A canal from Knottingley to the new docks and new town at Goole provided a much shorter route to the River Ouse from 1826. The New Junction Canal was constructed in 1905, to link the system to the River Don Navigation, by then part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation.  - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.  - West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.  - Skipton ( also known as Skipton - in - Craven ) is a market town and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire , England . Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire , it is on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to the south of the Yorkshire Dales , 16 miles ( 26 km ) northwest of Bradford and 38 miles ( 61 km ) west of York . At the 2011 Census , Skipton had a population of 14,623 .  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - The Yorkshire Dales is an upland area of the Pennines in Northern England in the historic county of Yorkshire, most of it in the Yorkshire Dales National Park created in 1954.   - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - The Liverpool City Region is an economic and political area of England centred on Liverpool, which also incorporates the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, and Wirral. Other, wider, definitions of the city region also exist. Depending on the definition used, the region's population is between about 1.5 million and 2.3 million.  - Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the appellation of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool.  - Liverpool, in North West England, is a major city and metropolitan borough with an estimated population of 478,580 in 2015 within the City of Liverpool. Liverpool and its surrounding areas form the fifth largest metropolitan area in the UK, with an estimated population of over 2.24 million in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, which is the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region.  - Merseyside is a metropolitan county in North West England, with a population of 1.38 million. It encompasses the metropolitan area centred on both banks of the lower reaches of the Mersey Estuary, and comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and the city of Liverpool. Merseyside, which was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, takes its name from the River Mersey.  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - The West Riding of Yorkshire is one of the three historic subdivisions of Yorkshire, England. From 1889 to 1974 the administrative county, County of York, West Riding (abbreviated: \\"County of York (W.R.)\\") (the area under the control of West Riding County Council), was based closely on the historic boundaries. The lieutenancy at that time included the City of York and as such was named West Riding of the County of York and the County of the City of York.  - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities.  - Elmet was an independent Brittonic kingdom covering a region of what later became the West Riding of Yorkshire in the Early Middle Ages, between about the 5th century and early 7th century. Although its precise borders are unclear, it appears to have been bounded by the River Sheaf in the south and the River Wharfe in the east. It adjoined Deira to the north and Mercia to the south, and its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly a minor British kingdom. As such it was well to the east of other territories of the Britons in Wales and the West Country (\\"i.e.\\" Cornwall and Dumnonia), and to the south of those in the \\"Hen Ogledd\\" (\\"Old North\\"). As one of the southeasternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, it is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.  - The Pennines , also known as the Pennine Chain or Pennine Hills, are a range of mountains and hills in Northern England separating North West England from Yorkshire and North East England.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Municipal boroughs were a type of local government district which existed in England and Wales between 1835 and 1974, in Northern Ireland from 1840 to 1973 and in the Republic of Ireland from 1840 to 2002. Broadly similar structures existed in Scotland from 1833 to 1975 with the reform of royal burghs and creation of police burghs.  - The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is a canal in Northern England, linking the cities of Leeds and Liverpool. Over a distance of , it crosses the Pennines, and includes 91 locks on the main line. It has several small branches, and in the early 21st century a new link was constructed into the Liverpool docks system.  - Wakefield is a city in West Yorkshire, England, on the River Calder and the eastern edge of the Pennines, which had a population of 76,886 in 2001, increasing slightly for the five Wakefield wards (East, North, Rural, South and West) to 77,512 at the 2011 Census.  - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London.  - Craven is a local government district of North Yorkshire, England centred on the market town of Skipton. In 1974, Craven district was formed as the merger of Skipton urban district, Settle Rural District and most of Skipton Rural District, all in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The population of the Local Authority at the 2011 Census was 55,409. It comprises the upper reaches of Airedale, Wharfedale, Ribblesdale, and includes most of the Aire Gap and Craven Basin.  - Liverpool City Council is the governing body for the city of Liverpool in Merseyside, England. It consists of 90 councillors, three for each of the city's 30 wards. The council is currently controlled by the Labour Party and is led by Mayor Joe Anderson. It is a constituent council of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.  - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Yorkshire and the Humber is one of nine official regions of England at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It comprises most of Yorkshire (South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire including Hull, the shire county of North Yorkshire and the City of York), North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. It does not include Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland (which are in the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire but not in the shire county). The population in 2011 was 5,284,000.  - Malham is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. Before 20th century boundary changes, the village was part of the Settle Rural District, in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. In the \\"Domesday Book\\", the name is given as Malgun, meaning \\"settlement by the gravelly places\\". In 2001 the parish had a population of approximately 150. Malham parish increased in size geographically (to include Malham Moor) and so at the 2011 Census had a population of 238.  - An administrative county was an administrative division in England and Wales and Ireland from 1888 to 1974, used for the purposes of local government. They are now abolished, although in Northern Ireland their former areas are used as the basis for lieutenancy.  - The metropolitan counties are a type of county-level administrative division of England. There are six metropolitan counties, which each cover large urban areas, typically with populations of 1.2 to 2.8 million. They were created in 1972 and are each divided into several metropolitan districts or boroughs.  - Market town or market right is a legal term, originating in the Middle Ages, for a European settlement that has the right to host markets, distinguishing it from a village and city. A town may be correctly described as a \\"market town\\" or as having \\"market rights\\", even if it no longer holds a market, provided the legal right to do so still exists.  - Bradford is in the Metropolitan Borough of the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, in the foothills of the Pennines west of Leeds, and northwest of Wakefield. Bradford became a municipal borough in 1847, and received its charter as a city in 1897. Following local government reform in 1974, city status was bestowed upon the wider metropolitan borough.  - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.  - Wharfedale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the upper valley of the River Wharfe. Towns and villages in Wharfedale (downstream, from west to east) include Buckden, Kettlewell, Conistone, Grassington, Hebden, Bolton Abbey, Addingham, Ilkley, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Otley, Pool-in-Wharfedale, Arthington, Collingham and Wetherby. Beyond Wetherby, the valley opens out and becomes part of the Vale of York.  - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England.  - Skipton was a rural district in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974. It was named after Skipton, which constituted an urban district on its southern border.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - Airedale is a geographic area in Yorkshire, England, corresponding to the river valley of the River Aire (pronounced \\"air\\").   - Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet grew but slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War.  - The City of Bradford is a local government district of West Yorkshire, England, with the status of a city and metropolitan borough. It is named after its largest settlement, Bradford, but covers a far larger area which includes the towns of Keighley, Shipley, Bingley, Ilkley, Haworth, Silsden and Denholme. Bradford has a population of 528,155, making it the fourth-most populous metropolitan district and the sixth-most populous local authority district in England. It forms part of the West Yorkshire Urban Area conurbation which in 2001 had a population of 1.5 million and the city is part of the Leeds-Bradford Larger Urban Zone (LUZ), which, with a population of 2,393,300, is the fourth largest in the United Kingdom after London, Birmingham and Manchester.  - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - Ribblesdale is one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. It is the dale or upper valley of the River Ribble in North Yorkshire. Towns and villages in Ribblesdale (downstream, from north to south) include Selside, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Stainforth, Langcliffe, Giggleswick, Settle, Long Preston and Hellifield. Below Hellifield (sometimes below Settle) the valley of the river is generally known as the Ribble Valley.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again. The answer to this question is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. To provide a detailed explanation of the entire breathing process, it begins with the inhalation. The overall process is called respiration, and below are the steps involved: 1. You inhale, or breathe in, through your nose or mouth. This step introduces air, rich in oxygen, to your respiratory system. Your nostrils or mouth provide an entrance for the air to go into your body. Through the process of inhalation, you take in fresh air that contains life-sustaining oxygen. 2. Your diaphragm moves down. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscles found beneath the lungs, and it plays a crucial role in the respiration process. As you inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward, which increases the space in your chest cavity for the lungs to expand. 3. Your lungs have more room. As your diaphragm moves down, your lungs can expand due to the increase in space within the chest cavity. The thoracic cavity expands, and the ribcage moves outward and upward, allowing the lungs to draw in even more air. 4. Your lungs fill with air. With the increased space, your lungs can now fill up with the oxygen-rich air. This air travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, and finally reaches the alveoli – small air sacs where gas exchange takes place. 5. Gas exchange occurs. In the alveoli, oxygen is transferred from the air to the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide – a waste product produced by cellular respiration – is transferred from the blood to the alveoli, preparing it to be exhaled. 6. You exhale. After the gas exchange process is completed, you exhale or breathe out the carbon dioxide-filled air that your body doesn't need. This process is a result of the relaxation of your diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. Your ribcage moves back to its original position, and your diaphragm moves back up, reducing the volume of the chest cavity and pushing the air out of your lungs. 7. Carbon dioxide is exhaled. As you exhale, carbon dioxide leaves your body through your mouth or nose, completing the gas exchange process within your respiratory system. 8. You start the process over again. The entire process is a cycle that repeats itself, depending on your body's needs and activity level. This continuous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is an essential function for sustaining life and maintaining healthy cellular functions within the human body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On these day many shoppers buy with the holidays in mind . To be sure there are still intense crowd on the day after thanksgiving , led by the doorbusters who show up at dawn for early bird sales . It is one of the busiest day in terms of traffic according to Elsa , my sister in law who used to wait for black friday to shop early for her christmas gift ... I told her how to ease her burden in shopping during such particular day . Question: Why would she be burdened by this day of shopping ?","output":"Your sister-in-law, Elsa, might be burdened by shopping on Black Friday for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include large crowds, time constraints, financial pressures, and the overall stress of finding the perfect holiday gifts. 1. Large Crowds: One of the most significant factors contributing to the burden of shopping on Black Friday is the massive crowds that flock to stores. The feeling of being surrounded by a large number of people can be overwhelming, resulting in a stressful shopping experience. Navigating the crowded aisles, standing in long lines, and competing with other shoppers for limited quantities of discounted items can be physically and mentally exhausting. 2. Limited Time: Many shoppers feel pressure to find the best deals and purchase items quickly before they sell out on Black Friday. With limited time available to research and compare products, shoppers may feel rushed and struggle to make confident decisions. Additionally, shoppers who prioritize doorbuster deals may have to wake up early and sacrifice sleep, contributing to exhaustion and a lowered tolerance for stress. 3. Financial Pressures: Black Friday often comes hand-in-hand with expectations of deep discounts and spending, which can create financial stress for shoppers. Budgeting for holiday gifts is essential, but the allure of attractive deals can make it challenging to stick to that budget. The worry about overspending, combined with the desire to buy thoughtful gifts, can increase pressure during the shopping experience. 4. Gift Selection: Finding the perfect present for everyone on your list can be a daunting task even without the added pressures of Black Friday shopping. The challenge of selecting appropriate gifts, balancing the needs and wants of recipients, and dealing with the potential disappointment of not finding the ideal item can all contribute to a sense of burden during the shopping process. 5. High Expectations: There's a sense of anticipation and expectation associated with Black Friday, and the pressure to save money and score the best deals can be immense. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on the perfect deal or item can be a significant source of burden for shoppers, who may feel like they've failed if they don't meet their shopping goals. To ease the burden of shopping on Black Friday, consider these tips: 1. Plan ahead: Research deals, sales, and items of interest in advance, and create a prioritized shopping list to stay organized and focused. 2. Set a budget: Establish a budget before shopping and stick to it to avoid financial stress. 3. Shop online: Avoid the stressful in-store atmosphere by taking advantage of online deals and sales. 4. Opt for alternative shopping days: Consider shopping on days other than Black Friday, such as Small Business Saturday or Cyber Monday, for potentially less crowded experiences. 5. Pace yourself: Remember that shopping for holiday gifts is a process that doesn't need to be completed in a single day. Give yourself permission to take breaks and continue shopping at a more leisurely pace if needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What are the attributes of a developed country? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"First, let's analyze and answer the two questions separately. 1. What are the indicators of a developing country? There are numerous factors that can indicate that a country is in the developing stage. However, we can outline some key indicators: a. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: Developing countries typically have lower GDP per capita, which indicates the average economic output per person. b. Poverty Rate: A higher poverty rate is often found in developing countries, where a significant proportion of the population lives below the poverty line. c. Human Development Index (HDI): Developing countries generally have lower HDI scores, which combine income, education, and health indicators. d. Literacy Rate: Developing countries tend to have lower literacy rates, reflecting lower levels of education and a less skilled workforce. e. Health Care Access: Access to healthcare is often limited in developing countries, with fewer hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals available. f. Infrastructure: Developing countries often have inadequate infrastructure, including insufficient transportation networks, energy production, and sanitation systems. 2. What are the attributes of a developed country? Attributes of a developed country include: a. Higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: In developed countries, the average income per person and overall economic output are higher. b. Lower Poverty Rate: There is a smaller proportion of the population living below the poverty line in developed countries. c. Higher Human Development Index (HDI): Developed countries typically have higher HDI scores, which indicate better living conditions, access to education, and healthcare. d. Higher Literacy Rate: Developed countries tend to have better education systems, resulting in a higher literacy rate and a more skilled workforce. e. Better Health Care Access: Developed countries generally have more comprehensive healthcare systems, with greater access to hospitals, clinics, and medical professionals. f. Advanced Infrastructure: Developed countries boast well-developed infrastructure, such as efficient transportation networks, reliable energy production, and effective sanitation systems. Now, let's analyze whether these two questions inquire about the same information: The two questions are related, as they both explore the features of countries in different stages of development. However, they focus on opposite ends of the development spectrum. The first question asks for indicators of a developing country, while the second question asks for attributes of a developed country. Although the information is connected, the questions inquire about distinct aspects of country development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If I am to plant trees they will be oranges and not limes as the","output":"orange trees produce sweet and juicy fruits that we can use to make orange juice. You see, there are these lovely trees called orange trees that grow tasty orange fruits. These fruits are called oranges. Just like the color orange, they also have a nice, bright color and they smell really good!  We could have chosen to plant lime trees, but limes are not as sweet as oranges. Limes are green and small, and they are often used to add a sour taste to food and drinks. But orange trees are better friends for our backyard because they will give us more delicious and sweet fruits that we can all enjoy. So, when we plant the little baby tree in the ground, it will grow bigger and stronger over time. It will spread its branches wide and grow tall, reaching for the sky. It will make new leaves that will dance in the sunshine. And one day, we will see small flowers called blossoms on the tree. These blossoms will turn into little tiny oranges and then grow bigger and bigger until they are ready for us to pick and eat. Once our orange tree is big enough and has lots of oranges, we can share them with our friends, family, and neighbors. We can have fun picking the oranges together and then enjoy them in many ways – eating them as they are, making orange juice, and even turning them into yummy orange jam or cakes.

After a hurling match, Damien witnesses the summary execution of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British Black and Tans. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the British Army vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade. After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's Royal Irish Constabulary barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four Auxiliaries. In the aftermath, Anglo-Irish landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the British Army's Intelligence Corps. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's socialist views. Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command.

Keep a basket of cat toys near the desk for your cat to play with. You could even set up a kitty condo or play area near your computer so that it's near you and you can keep an eye on it as it plays.  Rotate toys for added interest. Keep the cat's interest by only putting out one or two toys at a time. Try tying a string to your office door handle to provide your cat with the opportunity to bat it around. You can also try battery-operated toys. These can be particularly helpful if you need to focus on work but your cat likes a lot of play time. Every time your cat threatens to jump up on your workspace, grab the pointer and start playing laser tag across the floor. You can lead your cat away from your work area and into the ecstasy of play. There are even some automated laser toys that will occupy your cat without you needing to be an active participant. Set up a comfy space for your cat that is near your but not right next to your keyboard. Very often your cat just wants to be near you while you work or play on the computer. Indeed, the longer you're stuck there, the more it wants your attention and will be likely to put itself right in your face to get it. By placing a bed or comfy sleep spot near you as you work or play on the computer, your cat may be satisfied enough that it can see you to avoid feeling the need to attack your keyboard.  If you have a laptop, your cat may like the warmth of the computer. Try using a heated bed to keep them warm and off the keys. The comfort zone may not work with a kitten. Kittens think that everything is an invitation to play and that sleep just gets in the way. All the same, the earlier you can train your kitten to like sleeping near your workspace rather than pawing all over it, the better. Summary:","output":"1.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Which of these statements is WRONG? Answer: Possible answers:  (1).

She said while learning there have been arrests in her fiancee's death brings her some peace, it will never bring him back. That's hard to explain to their young son, who is only 5.      \\"He keeps asking about his daddy,\\" she said. \\"And to tell him he's not coming back has been hard. I try to explain. He's so young, he's only 5, he doesn't understand.\\"      Five teenage boys from Clio are being charged as adults with second degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, six counts each of malicious destruction of property and some other misdemeanors.      Bill Landon, one of White's best friends, was happy to hear police made arrests in the case, but questioned why they were charged with second degree murder instead of the more serious first degree murder.      \\"What did they think was going to happen, just going to bounce off the road?\\" he asked. \\"They knew it would hit a car. Unfortunately, it was my best friend and killed him.\\"      Cagle said she hopes the teens are punished to the full extent of the law, and the one who threw the rock that killed the 32-year-old White is sentenced to life in prison.      When asked if she will ever be able to forgive the teens, she said she's going to try.      \\"Because I know that's what Kenneth would have wanted, because he's a good man. He knows I'm a good-hearted person and he was a good-hearted person,\\" she said. \\"It's going to take time, a lot of time.\\"      Police have singled out a 17-year-old, the oldest in the group, for throwing the six-pound rock that killed White. No one at his home wanted to discuss the case, but a woman who came to door said they're grieving too. ||||| (CNN) A judge denied bond Tuesday for five Michigan teenagers charged with throwing a rock off a highway overpass and killing a passenger in a van.      The group of teens, aged 15-17, were arraigned in Genesee County district courtroom. They are accused of throwing a 6-pound rock off an overpass near Flint, Michigan, on October 18, fatally injuring 32-year-old Kenneth White.      White was riding home from work when he was struck in the face, head and chest by the rock that crashed through the windshield of the van in which he was a passenger.      Police said this is the rock that was thrown off the overpass.      \\"There's no words to describe it,\\" Kenneth White Sr, White's father, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"I've buried my mother, my father, and my oldest brother in the last four years and this is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.\\"      White was engaged to be married and leaves behind a 5-year-old son. A GoFundMe account started by a family friend to help with funeral expenses has raised over 64,000 since Wednesday.      \\"He keeps asking about his daddy,\\" Amiee Cagle, White's fiancee, told CNN affiliate WJRT . \\"And to tell him he's not coming back has been hard. I try to explain. He's so young, he's only 5, he doesn't understand.\\"      Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell confirmed to CNN that based on their investigation, officials believe Kyle Anger, 17, threw the rock that killed White, but all five boys are being charged with the same counts. The maximum penalty is life in prison.      Anger and Alexzander Miller, 15; Mark Sekelsky, 16; Mikadyn Payne, 16; and Trevor Gray, 15, were arraigned Tuesday and pleaded not guilty, according to Gray's attorney, Erwin Meiers.      \\"To propel the size of boulder down from the Dodge Road overpass to a 70 mph vehicle that's headed southbound, you ought to know -- a reasonable person would know -- that that is creating a high risk of great bodily harm, or in this case, death,\\" said David Leyton, the county prosecutor, at a news conference on Monday.      The five teenagers are being charged as adults, with one count of second-degree murder each. They are also being charged with conspiracy to commit murder, six felony counts each of malicious destruction of property and two other lesser charges.      \\"Although the charges are all the same, the kids are all different,\\" Mark Sekelsky's lawyer, Frank Manley, told CNN affiliate WNEM . \\"The actions that kids may have become involved in are all different. So even though the charges were all read exactly the same, my anticipation is that there will be a distinction once the evidence comes forward.\\"      A preliminary hearing is scheduled for the teens on November 2.      \\"You've got five children charged with offenses carrying life in prison,\\" Meiers told CNN. \\"One minute they're looking to going to prom or homecoming and the next minute they're sitting in a detention center.\\"      CNN reached out to the lawyers of the other defendants, but they weren't readily available for comment. ||||| Five teenagers have been charged as adults in the death of a man who was killed by a rock thrown on I-75.      The teenagers include Kyle Anger, Alexzander Miller, Trevor Gray, Mikadyn Payne and Mark Sekelsky.      >>Slideshow: Mid-Michigan mug shots<<      All five of them were arraigned in front of a judge on Tuesday, Oct. 24 where not-guilty pleas were entered.      They were charged with one count of second-degree murder (which is punishable by up to life in prison), one count of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, six felony counts of malicious destruction of property and two misdemeanor counts of malicious destruction of property.      “I don’t think this was a deliberate attempt to take somebody’s life. It was a willful and wanton act that resulted in somebody’s death. These people should have known better,” Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said. “Under Michigan law that is second-degree murder.”      >>Read more: Why defense attorney thinks all five teenagers were charged with second-degree murder<<      The teenagers range in age from 15-17.      The charges stem from the Oct. 18 incident that killed 32-year-old Kenneth White of Mt. Morris.      \\"These particular individuals knowingly created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm, knowing that death or such harm would be the likely result of such actions,\\" Leyton said.      Police said White was riding in a vehicle that night when he was struck in the head and chest by \\"a very large rock\\" thrown from the Dodge Road overpass in Genesee County's Vienna Township.      Investigators believe that rock was thrown by Kyle Anger.      White was a passenger in a van driven by his friend, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said. The driver saw a large rock coming at the van and said the rock entered the passenger side through the windshield, Pickell said.      After the rock entered the van the driver said he passed four vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road before he could pull over, Pickell said.      \\"Detectives discovered several vehicles on the shoulder of the roadway with flat tires and other damage to the vehicles,\\" Pickell said.      Leyton said White died from blunt force trauma to the head and chest. He sustained lacerations and abrasions to the head and face, a skull fracture, an injury to the brain, fracture to his facial skeleton, a huge laceration to his chest, and a broken clavicle and upper ribs, Leyton said.      The rock that struck White was thrown from the north end of the overpass and was about 5 inches wide, 8 inches long and weighed six pounds, Pickell said.      Prior to the incident that killed White, the suspects threw a tire off of the Farrand Road overpass, Pickell said.      Afterwards, officials said the five went to McDonald's to eat.      White was the father of four children, according to his obituary.      \\"I just don't understand how somebody could just go out like that and think it's fun. I mean, you take somebody's child away from them. You take their father away from them. You take their brother away from them,\\" said Kenny White, victim's father.      He said the punishment is a far cry from the pain and suffering his family has had to endure.      \\"They can't give it the way I want it. So we'll just go with what they got to do with it. You know what I'm saying? I can't give them enough punishment. You know, because even if they spend 30 years in prison, they get to wake up every single day. They still get phone calls from their parents. They still get visitors. My son don't get none of that no more. That was taken away from him for something stupid,\\" Kenny White said.      A judge denied bail for all five teenagers. They are set to appear in court again on Nov. 2.      \\"It's a murder case and there was no anticipation that anybody was going to be let out today,\\" said Frank Manley, defense attorney.      Manley is representing Mark Sekelsky. He cautions the community against painting all of the teens with the same brush.      \\"Although the charges are the same, the kids are all different. The actions that the kids may have become involved in are all different. So even though the charges were read exactly the same, my anticipation is that there will be a distinction once the evidence comes forward,\\" Manley said.      Manley said the fact that a man lost his life weighs heavy on the Sekelsky family.      \\"I can only speak to the parents of my child who are devastated,\\" Manley said.      All five of the teenagers attended Clio High School.      Clio Area Schools Superintendent Fletcher Spears III released this statement on Oct. 24 regarding the incident:      Clio Area Schools joins with the entire community in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Kenneth White in the wake of his tragic death on October 18, 2017. This is an extremely difficult time for our entire community. Whether we knew Mr. White, those who are being charged and their families, or have driven this same stretch of road countless times, many of us have a personal connection with this senseless tragedy. This is a stark reminder that we need to impress upon all of our young people that actions have consequences: and sometimes those consequences can be tragic. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with Mr. White’s family, as well as his many friends during this difficult time. As a District, we are also working to provide support to those in our school and community who have been impacted by this tragedy. Due to privacy requirements, imposed by federal law, we cannot provide any information regarding the students involved.      Why would somebody do this?      TV5 spoke to a psychotherapist about why the teenagers would do something like this.      \\"Thinking wow that teenagers can get to that point where they lose their focus of what really are intended consequences of the choices that they're playing,\\" Dr. Thomas Haller said.      Haller has been a psychotherapist for more than 20 years. He said something like this is typically the result of mob mentality.      \\"Everything is focused through this filter of what will my friends think and how will they view what I'm doing or not doing. And so they lose the focus of outside and how it's affecting somebody else,\\" Haller said.      Haller hopes this case will encourage parents to talk to their teens about peer pressure.      \\"You have to help yourself stay true to you and not play to the notion that I have to have my friends like everything I do,\\" Haller said.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose resting or sleeping happens, how will it affect the person is infected with more bacteria.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Resting or sleeping can have both direct and indirect effects on a person infected with bacteria. While sleep itself won't eliminate bacteria, it plays a critical role in the overall function of the immune system and the body's ability to respond to infections. Here's an explanation of how rest or sleep may affect the process of bacterial infection: 1. Direct effects: a) Improved immune response: Sleep has been shown to improve the immune system's ability to respond to infections. During sleep, the body releases various cytokines - proteins that help regulate the immune system. These cytokines are crucial for fighting off infections and reducing inflammation. b) Enhanced recovery of damaged cells: During deep sleep stages, the body increases the production of growth hormone, which aids in cell repair and regeneration. This process can be helpful in repairing cells damaged by bacterial toxins. c) Improved emotional well-being: Chronic stress can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infections. Rest and sleep can help alleviate stress, which in turn may benefit a person's overall immune health. 2. Indirect effects: a) Supporting overall health: Rest and sleep play a crucial role in maintaining overall health, including metabolism regulation, mental health, and cardiovascular health. All of these factors contribute to a person's ability to fight off infections. b) Encouraging healthy habits: Getting adequate rest and sleep can lead to healthier lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise and a well-balanced diet, all of which can indirectly boost immune function and support the body in fighting infections. While resting or sleeping is an essential part of recovery and maintaining overall health, it is not a direct weapon against bacterial infections. A person with a bacterial infection should seek appropriate medical care and follow their healthcare provider's recommendations, which may include the use of antibiotics or other treatments, in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle and adequate rest."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the following context:  During 1995 Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \\"The Wall for Generation X\\", and which became Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by Time as \\"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\\", Mellon Collie debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than Siamese Dream, it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\". The album spawned five singles—\\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\", \\"1979\\", \\"Zero\\", \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song \\"I'll Be with You Tonight\\", and \\"Thirty-Three\\"—of which the first three were certified gold and all but \\"Zero\\" entered the Top 40.

We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men), whether there are 'accidents' and he says, \\"I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.\\"Catherine and James pull into a garage, where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss, Bob (Tony Shalhoub), about the car they hear coming into the shop, what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is, based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're \\"college people\\" meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine, he falls for her.James, obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine, and Ed says, \\"May I look under the bonnet?\\" James, reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents.

Ed says he'll go check with his boss about fixing it, and goes in to tell his boss that he's in love, that time and space stopped, that he could see himself kissing Catherine in the future. Ed tells Catherine that fixing the car will take days, and she uses his phone to call a cab, giving the cab company and Ed her address...

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to calculate amount of unemployment in ohio  Meet the criteria for unemployment insurance.  There are a certain number of factors that determine whether or not you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If the following applies to you, then you are considered unemployed and are eligible for unemployment insurance and benefits.","output":"First and foremost, you must be either partially or totally unemployed through no fault of your own. This means that if you have been let go from your job, it must have been due to lack of work or business closure, rather than for misconduct or quitting voluntarily. In the case of partial unemployment, your work hours must have significantly reduced due to circumstances beyond your control. Additionally, you must have a qualifying base period of employment to establish eligibility. In Ohio, the base period is determined by looking at the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters before the start of your unemployment claim. For instance, if you file your claim in July 2021, your base period would comprise of the four quarters between April 2020 and March 2021. Within this base period, you must have worked in at least two quarters and earned a minimum pre-determined amount, which is subject to adjustment each year based on average weekly wages in the state. Moreover, you must be able and available to work during the entire period of your unemployment. This means meeting the physical and mental requirements essential for your line of work, as well as being prepared to accept suitable job offers. Suitability is typically determined by factors such as prior skills and experience, previous wage level, commuting distance, and the working environment. It is also crucial to actively seek employment, making genuine efforts to find a new job by conducting job searches, submitting applications, attending job interviews, and networking with potential employers. Furthermore, you may be required to participate in reemployment services provided by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS). These services aim to assist claimants in re-entering the workforce, offering resources such as job search assistance, skills assessment, training, and workshops. Failure to participate in these services without good cause may result in disqualification from receiving unemployment benefits. To calculate the amount of unemployment compensation you are entitled to receive, Ohio utilizes a formula based on your earnings during the base period. A weekly benefit is calculated by taking the average of your earnings in the two highest-earning quarters of your base period, then dividing that amount by 26. The maximum amount of benefits that can be collected each week is currently capped at around 50% of the state's average weekly wage. Once your weekly benefit is determined, you can receive payments for a maximum of 26 weeks within a 12-month benefit period, provided that you continue to meet the eligibility requirements. In conclusion, calculating the amount of unemployment in Ohio depends on meeting specific eligibility criteria, such as job separation through no fault of your own, sufficient earnings and employment within a base period, being able and available to work, and participating in reemployment services. Once these qualifications are met, a calculation based on your earnings during the base period determines the weekly benefit amount and the duration of the compensation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1992, well before the advent of social media, Superman was killed and comic books went flying off the shelves.  In 2007, social media like Facebook and Twitter were in their infancy when Captain America died.  And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus.  The just-released \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years. All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of \\"The Superior Spider-Man\\" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit.  Otto believes that with the combination of his intelligence and Parker's inherited memories and spider powers, he can be an uber-Spider-Man. He can live Parker's life better than Peter could -- from fighting crime to getting back together with on-again, off-again girlfriend Mary Jane Watson.  When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.  Slott reacted on his Twitter and Facebook by saying he would report any threats: \\"Reality check: There is NO such thing as a 'funny death threat.' Especially if you TAG someone in it.\\"  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. How long have comics had shake-ups in their pages? 2. How do some fans feel about it? 3. How did other fans react? 4. When did Superman die? 5. What about Captain America? 6. What issue was leaked early? 7. Is Spiderman buddies with Doctor Octopus? 8. What is he to Spiderman? 9. What's Spidey's real name? 10. What's going to happen to him? 11. Who caused a firestorm by letting people know that? 12. What happened after Marvel revealed that Parker will die?

Article: The character can be based on a real person or well-known literary or mythological character, or created along common character tropes. Common character ideas include: robots, astronauts, literal statues (e.g. “The Thinker”), and mimes. For ideas or inspiration, look through pictures of living statues online, or go to an area of a nearby city in which living statues frequently perform. Start by visiting costume stores or novelty shops to find the necessary wigs and clothing for your costume. If you’d like to custom make your own costume, you can visit a fabric store to purchase an appropriate color and style of fabric, and then sew your own costume. If you have the option, choose a cotton fabric for your costume. Cotton holds its color well, even if you’re performing in rain or snow. To flesh out your appearance as a human statue, you can accessorize with objects to wear and hold. Look for objects that match your overall theme: if you’re a robot, hold an imitation computer; if you’re a statue, hold a book to “read”; if you’re a pirate, hold a plastic sword and hook.  Sometimes just going shopping will be enough to inspire the costume, character, and actions you choose to perform. Yard sales, thrift shops and antique shops are best. You’re bound to find something odd that will spark your inspiration. Other helpful places for props are home improvement stores (if you’re looking for mechanical items) and fabric and craft stores. Items found at these types of stores may spark your creativity and give you ideas of how to accessorize your statue character. Many living statues cover themselves completely in makeup, to give them the appearance of being a statue, robot, or other non-human character. Depending on your natural skin tone, white makeup works best; copper and silver are other popular face-paint colors. You should be able to find costume makeup at a costume or hobby store, or through most online retailers.  If using a white or non-metallic color, use water based cake-makeup as opposed to oil based. If you use oil, dust it with a finishing powder so it doesn’t smudge. In order to draw attention to your eyes, you may want to line them in brown or black with regular eyeliner.  Adding extra makeup (like lipstick or blush) on top of your solid base may be necessary, but keep it minimal unless the makeup is an essential part of your costume.

Group A had people under 35 years old in it, while group B had people over 65.  Which group had a greater decline in stamina?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and the hint, it can be inferred that Group B, consisting of individuals over the age of 65, would experience a greater decline in stamina compared to Group A. The factors contributing to this decline are closely associated with the aging process. As mentioned in the hint, during late adulthood, there are several physiological changes and increased risks that can affect an individual's overall health and well-being. These factors include: 1. An increased risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other age-related conditions. 2. A general decline in strength and stamina, often attributed to the loss of muscle mass, reduced lung capacity, and lower metabolic rates. 3. Impairment of senses, such as vision and hearing, as well as deteriorating reflexes, which can affect an individual's ability to carry out activities that demand physical coordination and endurance. 4. A weaker immune system, leading to increased vulnerability to illnesses and a longer recovery period. 5. Higher prevalence of chronic conditions such as arthritis and neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, Group A, composed of people under the age of 35, are considered early and middle adults. These individuals typically do not exhibit the same level of age-related issues faced by older adults and generally have better stamina. Their bodies are still in a phase of growth and development, and they are likely to have more functional capacity compared to those belonging to Group B. To summarize, Group B, consisting of individuals over 65 years of age, would have a greater decline in stamina as a result of the various age-related physiological changes and increased health risks that come with late adulthood. Consequently, this group would be the most affected by the loss of strength, stamina, and overall resilience when compared to their younger counterparts in Group A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: You'd want marine grade steel cable aboard your what? Possible A: winch, ship, ground, construction site, suspension bridge  Why is \\"ship\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The term \\"marine grade\\" typically refers to materials that are designed to resist corrosion from the sea or saltwater. This is an essential characteristic for materials used in maritime environments, as saltwater is highly corrosive, and prolonged exposure can severely degrade most materials.  Hence, you'd potentially need \\"marine grade steel cable\\" aboard your ship, as ships spend most of their operational time in seawater and thus need materials that can stand up to this harsh environment. On a ship, the steel cable can be used in various components and mechanisms such as anchoring, mooring, towing, or lifting.  While it is possible to use marine-grade steel on winches, construction sites, or suspension bridges, the phrase \\"aboard your..\\" hints towards a mode of transport, further leading towards a ship as the correct common-sense answer given the choices. On the other hand, the terms \\"ground\\" and \\"construction site\\" generally do not align well as transport uses.  Using marine-grade steel cable on a suspension bridge might not be a wrong idea, especially if the bridge is in a coastal area, but the term \\"aboard\\", which refers to being on or in a vehicle (i.e., a ship, plane, or vehicle), makes \\"ship\\" the most suitable answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane?, using the article: In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the four largest ethnic groups in Carabane are: 1. Jola: The Jola ethnic group is the largest in Carabane. They are distinct from other ethnic groups in Senegal due to their language, egalitarian society, lack of political hierarchy, and absence of slavery. The Jola account for 80 to 90% of Basse Casamance's population and 6 to 8% of Senegal's total population. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit and geographical isolation. 2. Wolofs: The Wolofs are the second-largest ethnic group in Carabane. They are part of the larger Senegalese population and follow Islam as their religion. Wolof and Serer fishermen have been practicing Islam since the 19th century. 3. Lebous: The Lebous are another significant ethnic group in Carabane. Although the article does not provide extensive details about them, they are mentioned as one of the major groups in the area. 4. Serers (including Niominka fishermen): The Serers, including the Niominka fishermen, are the fourth-largest ethnic group in Carabane. Similar to the Wolofs, they have been practicing Islam since the 19th century. Additionally, the article also mentions the presence of other ethnic communities, including Manjacks, Susu people from Guinea, and a community from Guinea-Bissau.

Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Possible answers: 1. no. 2. yes.","output":"1. no. While both questions are related to college admissions and the consideration of grades from various years of high school, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They focus on different aspects of the college admissions process. Let's break down the questions and analyze their differences. Question 1: \\"Do colleges look at freshman grades?\\" This question aims to find out whether or not colleges consider grades from a student's freshman year when reviewing applications. The main concern here is about the importance of these specific grades in college admissions decisions. Answer: Yes, colleges do look at freshman grades during the admissions process. The degree of importance given to these grades might vary among colleges and universities, but generally, freshman year performance is a part of the overall evaluation along with grades from other high school years. Admissions officers look for trends in academic performance, potential growth, and the student's capacity for improvement as they review academic records. High school transcripts provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's academic accomplishments, thereby highlighting their strengths and achievements over the four-year period. Question 2: \\"If I do bad freshman year and do good sophomore year how do colleges look at that?\\" This question focuses on a particular scenario where a student's academic performance differs significantly between freshman and sophomore years. The main concern here is understanding how colleges would perceive this change in academic performance and whether it will have any impact on their chances of admission. Answer: If there is a noticeable improvement in your academic performance from freshman to sophomore year, colleges will likely view it in a positive light. Demonstrating growth and the ability to bounce back from a rough start can be beneficial in the college admissions process. Admissions officers tend to appreciate resilience, determination, and hard work. However, it is essential to maintain a strong academic record throughout your high school career, as consistency in performance is generally valued by college admissions committees. Doing well in your remaining junior and senior years and continuing the upward trend in academic performance will strengthen your application and demonstrate your commitment to achieving academic success. In conclusion, while both questions are related to the weight of high school grades in college admissions, they tackle different aspects. The first question asks about the consideration of freshman grades, while the second question focuses on the implications of varying grade patterns across different years. Therefore, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"Mutations are what to evolution?\\" and the following answer choices:  - Plants growth  - essential  - optional  - competition  - dangerous  - non essential  - voluntary  - allow growth  Now knowing that mutations are essential for evolution to occur and when that occurs, several things happen, choose the best answer. Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"Mutations are what to evolution?\\" is \\"essential.\\" Mutations play a crucial role in the process of evolution, as they are the primary source of the variation in genetic material within a population. This genetic diversity is essential for species to adapt, survive, and evolve in response to changing environmental conditions. Mutations occur when there is a change in the sequence of DNA nucleotides. These changes can be caused by a variety of factors, including errors in DNA replication, exposure to specific chemicals or radiation, and certain types of viral infections. Although some mutations may be harmful or neutral in their effect on an organism, others can provide a selective advantage. These beneficial mutations become more prevalent within a population over time due to the process of natural selection, which favors individuals with traits that enhance their reproductive success. Evolution, at its core, is driven by genetic variation. In the absence of mutations, each generation of offspring would be identical to its parents, and there would be no room for adaptation or the development of new traits. This is why mutations are considered essential for the evolution process. The other answer choices presented, such as \\"plants growth,\\" \\"optional,\\" \\"competition,\\" \\"dangerous,\\" \\"non-essential,\\" \\"voluntary,\\" and \\"allow growth,\\" do not fully encapsulate the fundamental relationship between mutations and evolution. It is important to note that not all mutations are beneficial. Some mutations can be harmful, leading to decreased survivability or reproductive capabilities.

Una din slăbiciunile etichetei este faptul că consumatorii nu sunt conştienţi de aceasta, iar în această privinţă sunt de acord cu dl Wijkman şi, prin urmare, aceasta nu este deosebit de atractivă nici pentru producători. Translate to English","output":"One of the weaknesses of the labeling system is that consumers are not aware of it, and in this regard, I agree with Mr. Wijkman, and therefore, it is not particularly attractive for manufacturers either. The labeling system is an essential element in the commercialization of products, as it aims to inform consumers about the characteristics, qualities, and origin of a product. However, its effectiveness can be significantly impeded by various factors. One such factor is the lack of awareness among consumers regarding the existence of these labeling systems. This lack of awareness can negatively affect both consumers and producers. Consumer awareness plays a vital role in the success of a labeling system. If consumers are unaware of the labels, they will not be able to make informed decisions when purchasing products. Consequently, the intended purpose of the labeling system in promoting transparency in the market and facilitating consumer choice is compromised. The lack of awareness of the labeling system can be attributed to numerous sources, including insufficient marketing and promotion efforts, complex labeling information, and a scarcity of educational programs aimed at increasing consumer knowledge. For manufacturers and producers, an ineffective labeling system creates a scenario where the investment made in obtaining certifications, conducting tests, and implementing necessary measures to be included in a labeling system does not yield the expected benefits. This lack of incentives for manufacturers may result in a reduction in the number of companies willing to apply and adhere to environmentally friendly or socially responsible principles. Consequently, this might lead to a decline in overall quality and sustainability in the market. Given these repercussions, it is essential to address the issue of consumer awareness regarding the labeling system to ensure its effectiveness for all stakeholders involved. There are multiple strategies that can be employed to improve consumer awareness of the labeling system: 1. Improving marketing and promotional efforts: This includes investing in advertising, social media campaigns, and public relations activities that aim to increase the visibility and understanding of the labeling system in the eyes of consumers. 2. Simplifying labeling information: The complexity of labeling systems can often overwhelm consumers and create difficulties in understanding the meaning and implications of various labels. Streamlining and simplifying the labeling information can enhance consumers' understanding and awareness. 3. Implementing educational programs: Developing and incorporating educational programs and initiatives that focus on the importance of label information and how to interpret the data can significantly boost the overall awareness of consumers. 4. Collaboration with retailers: Working closely with retailers can ensure that labeling information is prominently displayed and easily accessible for consumers. Retailers can also be trained to provide additional information on the labeling system to their customers. By adopting these strategies and maintaining an ongoing commitment to improving consumer awareness, the weaknesses of the labeling system can be mitigated, and it can serve as an influential tool for both consumers and manufacturers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Looks good, works lousy Review: If you look at the photo carefully, notice that you cannot see the bottom half of the eraser...There is a reason why, it sucks... Not only is the eraser the color white (which looks dirty once used on colored chalk), but it is a quarter of an inch thick and the rest is the wooden handle! Well, I did not buy this for the fancy handle, I need a tool that is dependable and erases well. So I bought this for my child to use and it hardly erased. So I thought I would give it a try and had to push firmly on the board and guess what, I still see the chalk marks! Although this eraser does looks nice, it just doesn't work. Oh well, we win some and we loose some and I gotta count this purchase as a loss. I'm just glad that I didn't pay too much for it. A:","output":"The customer appears to be significantly dissatisfied with the product in question. The dissatisfaction is vividly expressed throughout the review as the customer highlights several issues they encountered with the product, which appears to be a type of eraser. Breaking down the review, the customer first points out that the bottom half of the eraser (which is arguably its most important part) cannot be seen in the product photo. They attribute this to the product's poor quality. The customer seems particularly upset by the eraser's thickness, which is only a quarter of an inch. They indicate that the bulk of the product is made up of the wooden handle, which they believe is an aesthetic feature that doesn't enhance the actual functionality of the eraser. Additionally, the customer also isn't fond of the eraser's white color. They observe that it starts to look dirty once it has been used on colored chalk, contributing to their overall dissatisfaction.  Furthermore, the key function of an eraser which is to erase well failed to perform as expected. The reviewer states that their child had difficulty erasing with it and that they also did not experience better results when they attempted usage. Even when using force to erase, the chalk marks remained visible.  Finally, the customer expresses regret over the purchase, deeming it a loss. Their concluding statement reveals their relief that they didn't spend a lot of money on the product.  Hence, when all these points are taken into account, it is clear that the reviewer is dissatisfied with the product.

This film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. A martian that took different shapes. Special effects that looked like something that a little child would create. In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this film, yes, actually there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end.

Write some highlights for the following article: A man who helped break up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last week found out just what it's like to be famous when video of his heroic deed went viral. The only problem is that many people thought that the man in question, Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was actually actor Paul Rudd. That is until Rudd's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video, and someone who knows Kravit revealed his identity to the website Jezebel, leading to what Kravit describes as a 'pretty crazy day.' Scroll down for video. Hero: Ben Kravit (above) broke up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday. Mistaken identity: When a video of his heroic deed went viral, many started to believe it was Paul Rudd seen in a plaid shirt (above circled in red) breaking up the fight. No help: Kravit (above circled in red) has said workers at the airport and TSA agents were no help and seemed to do little to stop the fight from happening. Now, everyone wants to know more about Kravit, a brand manager who works for Dr. Pepper Snapple and is engaged to a woman who is no doubt the envy of many these past few days. It all began last Thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt. Then, when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong, he screamed, 'Queers! That’s what I’m upset about. This fa**ot right here.' Seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt, while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him. That is when Kravit, the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault. The whole time, a passenger named Andrew Kennedy was filming the melee, which has now been viewed close to four million times on YouTube. It wasn't me: A publicist for Rudd (above) revealed on Monday that it was not the actor in the video. America's sweetheart: Kravit (above with his fiancee) is a 28-year-old brand manager for Dr. Pepper Snapple. Good sport: Said Kravit (above with his fiancee) of the experience, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years' And that is when people watching the video started to wonder if Rudd, the star of films including Clueless, Anchorman and This Is 40 was responsible for taking down the homophobe. 'It seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it,' said Kravit. 'I have gotten the doppelgänger about [Rudd] before, but nothing like today. It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.' As for why he jumped to action, the young man said, 'I know people can get agitated at airports, but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control. I was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two, but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim.' He added, 'It was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things, let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it. I'm glad I, along with the others who helped out, were there to help the victim and nothing worse came of it.' Paul Rudd would be proud.","output":"A man named Ben Kravit helped stop an anti-gay attack at an airport. He was very brave and kind.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Hunting.","output":"What are the different hunting methods and techniques used by hunters to catch their prey? Hunting has been a part of human culture for millennia and has evolved in various ways. A wide range of methods and techniques have been adopted by hunters to catch their prey, driven by factors such as location, target species, cultural traditions, and technological advancements. Some of the most common hunting methods and techniques include: 1. Still hunting: This method involves the hunter quietly moving through an area inhabited by their target species, taking time to observe and listen for signs of prey. Still hunting requires patience, stealth, and excellent understanding of the animal's habits and habitat. 2. Spot-and-stalk hunting: In this technique, the hunter first locates their prey from a distance, typically using binoculars or spotting scopes, and then formulates a plan to approach the animal without being detected. This method requires patience and good knowledge of wind direction and animal behavior. 3. Ambush hunting: This technique involves the hunter waiting in a concealed position, often for an extended amount of time, for an animal to pass within range of their weapon. Blinds and tree stands are commonly used in ambush hunting. Success largely depends on the hunter's ability to predict prey movement patterns and choose an ideal location for an ambush. 4. Driven hunting: A group of hunters, sometimes accompanied by dogs or beaters, work together to drive prey from their hiding places towards a prearranged line of shooters. The hunters must coordinate effectively, as timing and positioning are crucial for success. 5. Pursuing with hounds: The use of specially trained dogs to track, chase, and corner prey has been a popular hunting method for centuries. Hounds can be used to pursue prey like foxes, boars, or bears, with the hunters following the dogs on foot or horseback. 6. Hunting with falcons: Falconry, or the art of hunting with trained birds of prey, is an ancient hunting technique often used to target small game such as rabbits, hares, or birds. The falconer releases the bird which then locates and captures the prey, while the hunter follows on foot. 7. Trapping: Traps are devices used to capture, injure, or kill prey without the direct involvement of the hunter. They can be set in strategic locations, such as along well-used animal trails or near burrows, and rely on the animal's behavior or habits to trigger the trap. Examples of traps include snares, foothold traps, and cage traps. 8. Bow hunting and modern firearms: Modern hunters have a variety of weapons to choose from, including bows, shotguns, and rifles. Each type of weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as prey size, distance, power requirements, and hunting regulations. 9. Calling and decoys: Hunters often employ calls and decoys to attract prey within range. Animal calls mimic the sounds made by the target species to evoke a response, such as an elk bugle or a duck call. Decoys are artificial imitations of the target species, often placed within the field of view of the prey to trick them into coming closer. 10. Hunting with ATVs or horses: In some circumstances, hunters use transportation like all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) or horses to cover ground quickly and pursue prey. While some argue that this method is unfair to the prey, it can be effective in certain cases, especially when hunting in large, open areas. These are just a few examples of the diverse techniques used by hunters across the world. Each has its unique challenges and advantages, and many hunters often utilize a combination of methods depending on their environment, experience, and target species."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library, as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement.At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city, it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population. Historian Simon Schama noted that \\"Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes, a new kind of city in the world; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke\\". An American visitor taken to Manchester's blackspots saw \\"wretched, defrauded, oppressed, crushed human nature, lying and bleeding fragments\\".The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself...  answer the following question:  What were five new things that were happening in Manchester at the time? A:","output":"1. New industrial processes: The Industrial Revolution led to the development and implementation of new industrial processes in Manchester, particularly in the textile industry. 2. New ways of thinking: The Manchester School emerged, promoting free trade and laissez-faire economic policies. 3. New classes or groups in society: The industrial growth in Manchester led to the emergence of new social classes and groups, including the working class and the industrial bourgeoisie. 4. New religious sects: Manchester's diverse and rapidly changing population contributed to the rise of various religious sects in the city. 5. New forms of labor organization: With the growth of the working class, new forms of labor organization emerged, such as trade unions. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester in 1868."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft. He scored the 2003 film The Low Budget Time Machine and wrote two songs, \\"Birthday Video\\" and \\"Fake Purse,\\" for the Showtime television series Weeds in 2005. Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, Smitten, took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, during the recording. Santiago described the album as \\"a lot poppier and quirkier\\" than the band's previous material. The band simultaneously released The Smitten Sessions, a limited edition EP.

Write a summary based on this article: A California State University Monterey Bay police officer was placed on leave and is under investigation for not shooting an emotionally distraught student with a Taser.      According to the Statewide University Police Association union, the veteran officer could be fired because he refused to use his Taser on a student out of fear for the student's health.      VIDEO: CSU Monterey Bay officer refused to shoot student with Taser      SUPA President Jeff Solomon said terminating an college campus officer who put a student's safety first is inexplicable. The student and officers were not injured during the incident.      \\"Our officer said and felt that there was no need for the level of force that was applied, and my understanding was that's why he didn't deploy his Taser,\\" Solomon said.      Marina police, however, said that's not what happened, and claim the officer \\"froze.\\"      According to police reports, the incident happened in February on Petersburg Court. The CSUMB officer and three Marina police officers responded to a call about a suicidal student.      Solomon said the CSUMB officer successfully defused the situation and was able to help the student calm down. He left to get the student a cup of water after the student asked for one.      While he was gone, the three Marina police officers began physically restraining the student, the student became distraught again, and the Marina officers told the returning CSUMB officer to use his Taser, Solomon said.      The officer refused.      The lack of action prompted Marina police to file a \\"failure to act\\" complaint.      Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez said the failure to act is what led the Marina police to have to intervene. Rodriguez said the student had a knife and was non-compliant.      Solomon said he believes the Marina police made the complaint out of fear of their own actions.      The student's father told SUPA, \\"It defies logic and is extremely disappointing that, at a time when law enforcement is under fire for using more force than necessary, an officer is being terminated for attempting to use civilized methods to resolve a situation.\\"      The university's spokeswoman said she can't comment on the pending investigation, but said the case is \\"more complex\\" than what was detailed in the SUPA press release.      The officer, whose name has not been released, is a 20-year law enforcement veteran who has been with the University Police for the past eight years.      SUPA said this is his first disciplinary offense. ||||| Stun gun (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)      A California State University Monterey Bay police officer is on paid administration leave because he declined to tase a reportedly suicidal student, the officer’s union said.      Marina police — which also responded and filed the complaint — said the officer in actuality froze, standing silent while three Marina officers struggled with the student.      On Thursday, both agencies pointed to the other alleging, respectively, excessive force and lacking action.      The news comes amid fresh protests spurred by officer-involved fatalities across the country. In the past two weeks, grand juries have failed to indict a pair of white officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, with a gun; and Eric Garner in New York City with a chokehold. Both were black men.      In Salinas, four Latino men were killed this year by Salinas police officers, none of whom have Latino surnames.      Tension mounted and spilled over in May following the death of Carlos Mejia, who was wielding a pair of pruning shears when officers fatally shot him. A man was killed nearby during an ensuing protest and an officer trying to help him was hospitalized after a thrown bottle knocked him out cold.      Back in February, however, the CSUMB officer didn’t use his Taser, according to Jeff Solomon, Statewide University Police Association president. SUPA represents all CSU police officers.      On that point, Marina Police Chief Edmundo Rodriguez can agree.      “He just stood there,” Rodriguez said.      But from there the accounts of the February incident on Petersburg Court somewhat diverge.      According to Solomon, the CSUMB officer — a 20-year law enforcement veteran — arrived solo to a report of a suicidal man at the campus housing building on Petersburg Court. There, he found a man suffering a mental health crisis, Solomon said.      “[The student] had superficial cuts to his arms and wrist,” Solomon said. “But we have very specific training in crisis intervention and our officer was able to talk him down.”      Rodriguez, on the other hand, said the CSUMB officer initially declined assistance from Marina police but later asked their help in forcing entry to the apartment.      Walking into the room, the officers encountered a bloody scene, Rodriguez said.      “We saw blood everywhere,” he said. “On the carpet, on the floor. His wrists had been slashed. There was a bloody knife on the floor and a hammer on the bed.”      Scorched marks on the sweatshirt the man was wearing led the Marina officers to believe he’d tried to set himself on fire, Rodriguez said.      Although there were knives spread throughout the house, the student was no longer armed, Solomon said.      “[The officer] got him to sit on the bed, [the student] wasn’t confrontational,” Solomon said.      But the knife was still unsecured, Rodriguez emphasized.      Solomon said the CSUMB officer then obliged the man’s request for a glass of water. Mid-errand, the man stood up and asked the CSUMB officer to hurry, Solomon said.      Rodriguez, however, said the CSUMB officer actually left the room to either take or make a phone call. Doing so put the Marina officers in the awkward position of having to “take over” an incident that properly belonged to the CSUMB officer.      When the CSUMB officer returned he found the three Marina officers struggling with the student.      Solomon blamed the Marina police officers for “escalating the situation,” whereas Rodriguez claimed they were trying to prevent the man from accessing the knife or leaving the room.      “He was already a danger to himself,” Rodriguez said.      All three Marina police officers then fired their Tasers, Solomon said. Once the Taser cartridges were expelled, the officers then “dry stunned” the student — applying the Taser gun directly to his body. Solomon described the man as “150 pounds soaking wet.”      When ordered to use his Taser, the CSUMB officer refused, but turned the device over to a Marina sergeant for use, Solomon said. Ultimately, the student wasn’t injured in the struggle, he said.      Rodriguez said he doesn’t know whether the CSUMB officer turned his Taser over to the Marina sergeant. That would be strange, he added.      “He was just standing there,” Rodriguez said. “One officer was pleading with him to engage, to help them.”      Eventually, the three Marina officers were able to subdue the student and call emergency responders to assist, Rodriguez said. Since then, the man hasn’t again attempted to hurt himself.      Both Solomon and the CSUMB officer took issue with the Marina response.      “Generally, when one tool isn’t working, you usually move on to something else,” Solomon said. “There were four officers there. ... This doesn’t pass the smell test for us.”      Following the incident, the CSUMB officer called the Marina sergeant to protest the action inside the student’s dorm room, Solomon said. Shortly after, Marina police filed a complaint and asked for an investigation into the officer’s “failure to act.”      Marina officers on scene included a sergeant, a corporal and an officer. Together they have 32 years’ experience, Rodriguez said.      If SUPA hadn’t alleged excessive force by Marina police, Rodriguez said he likely wouldn’t have commented for the media. On Thursday, he defended the Marina officers’ actions and questioned why the union waited 10 months after the incident to make their grievances public.      “I get that they’re trying to save this officer’s job, but they did it at the expense of impugning the reputation of police officers they don’t even know,” he said.      CSUMB police officials never alleged excessive force, Rodriguez said. Because of a good working relationship between the two agencies, Rodriguez said he thought his counterpart at CSUMB would have apprised him of any concerns.      Ultimately, Rodriguez said he was “blindsided” by SUPA’s allegations and remained confident in his officers’ actions.      University officials largely declined comment, citing the ongoing personnel investigation. Joan Weiner, public information officer, did note “this case is much more complex than what was conveyed in the press release.”      The CSUMB officer in question has nine years’ experience on the Monterey Bay campus. He’s never been disciplined, Solomon said. Now, he faces potential termination.      In the wake of notable officer-involved deaths in Ferguson, Cleveland, Ohio, and New York, N.Y., Solomon said he was shocked by Marina’s complaint.      “We have an officer who showed incredible restraint in a very difficult situation,” he said. “He had it handled. The situation had all but been resolved when the other officers escalated it.”      Solomon added, “We have an officer who did everything right and he’s not being supported.”      Follow Allison Gatlin on Twitter @allison_salnews #salinas.

Statistically, most American adults change jobs at least a few times in their lives, and jobs that last for all or even the majority of one’s working life are exceedingly rare nowadays. To work successfully at the same job for nearly 30 years is definitely a big accomplishment, and it’s a distinction Alf Clausen has earned by composing music for The Simpsons for nearly its entire run.      Clausen has been the FOX animated institution’s sole composer since 1990, starting from season 2’s ‘Treehouse of Horror’, the first in The Simpsons’ long tradition of Halloween specials. Surprisingly enough, though, despite scoring some 567 episodes of the series, Clausen was not tapped to do the music for 2007’s The Simpsons Movie, with that honor going to Hans Zimmer. Still, most fans assumed that Clausen’s job was more than safe at this late juncture, and that he’d likely continue providing music for the show until it eventually ends.      That won’t be the case, however, as Variety reports that Clausen has been abruptly fired, just weeks ahead of The Simpsons’ season 29 premiere. The only explanation for this change so far comes from Clausen himself, who says that he received a call recently from Simpsons producer Richard Sakai informing him that his services would no longer be required, and that show was looking for “a different kind of music.”      Despite the season 29 premiere episode — entitled ‘The Serfsons’ — being just over a month away, Clausen’s departure appears to be immediate, with the season 28 finale ‘Dogtown’ serving as his last effort for The Simpsons. The identity of the composer that will replace him has yet to be revealed, but their first work for the show will definitely be heard during season the 29 premiere. FOX has yet to offer an official statement on the matter.      Clausen stands as one of the most respected composers working in animation, having earned a whopping 23 Emmy nominations — winning twice — for his contributions to The Simpsons. He’s also received 7 additional Emmy nominations for other projects. Some of Clausen’s other credits include Alf, The Critic, and Moonlighting. It’ll be interesting to see where he ends up next, as he’s likely to get several offers.      The Simpsons season 29 premieres October 1 on FOX.

Clausen told Variety that he received a call from “Simpsons” producer Richard Sakai that the company was seeking “a different kind of music” and that he would no longer be scoring the longtime Fox hit.      A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment.      Clausen, whose Emmy record includes two wins (1997 and ’98) and another 21 nominations for “The Simpsons” dating back to 1992, has scored more than 560 episodes of the series, starting early in the 1990-91 season. He is believed to be the most-nominated composer in Emmy history, with a total of 30 nominations overall.      He has also won five Annie Awards, all for his “Simpsons” music. His long tenure with the series has made him one of the most respected creators of animation music in TV history.      Clausen’s last complete score for the series was for the season finale of Season 28, which aired in May. The season premiere is slated for Oct. 1, but it is not yet clear who will be scoring that episode.      Speculation about Clausen’s dismissal involves cost-cutting measures, which have been ongoing at “The Simpsons” in recent years, despite its massive profits for Fox and executive producer James L. Brooks’ Gracie Films.      Clausen uses a 35-piece orchestra every week — something that “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening insisted upon from the start of the show. Including costs of musicians, recording studios, and orchestration, expenses routinely run into the millions of dollars per year. Danny Elfman’s “Simpsons” theme is expected to be retained. ||||| Thirty years ago this month, America’s favorite animated family made their debut as part of The Tracey Ullman Show. To celebrate, CoS will be broadcasting live from Springfield all week with a slew of Simpsons features. Today, Lior Phillips talks to longtime composer Alf Clausen, who’s arguably the eldest member of the Simpson family, having been there since the beginning.      You might not know the name Alf Clausen, but he’s been one of the most influential, talented musicians you’ve listened to for most of your life. For more than two and a half decades, Clausen has been in your living room, the roots of his music entangling the joy receptors in your brain for half an hour at a time. He’s covered seemingly every genre, from Latin jazz to Broadway show tunes. He’s composed songs that you know by heart, songs that can stretch a smile across your face year in and year out.            Alf Clausen, of course, has composed the music for every episode of The Simpsons for the last 27 years. He’s the man behind endlessly fun hooks like “We Put the Spring in Springfield” and “You’re Checkin’ In” (both of which netted him Emmys). He’s the never-seen but always felt main character alongside the intrepid Simpson family, the brains behind the 30 or so musical cues in each episode. Simply put, he contributes a beating heart and dramatic counterpoint to the brilliant stories, the two halves inseparable and feeding off each other in a beautiful crescendo of hilarity and yellow-hued surreality.      Because no celebration of The Simpsons could be complete without hearing from the one and only Clausen, Associate Editor Lior Phillips spoke with the Springfield maestro for a nice afternoon chat. Together, the two discussed Clausen’s entire career, specifically his transition from engineering to music, getting The Simpsons job, what it takes to compose the music for each episode, and his personal affinity for the Comic Book Guy.      What’s a typical day for you? Do you work from the studio or from home?      Well, I don’t work every single day, and when I do I typically work from home. With The Simpsons, we have kind of a scattered schedule for recording.      So that you could give yourself a little bit of time off and a necessary break between the episodes?      Yes, it’s funny you’re bringing that up because we are now enjoying the fruits of four weeks off before we go back to work.      Oh my gosh! Do you get four weeks off every year? Or is this quite a rare occurrence?      No, this one just came out of the blue. The network changed the schedule a little bit and everybody’s really enjoying it.      So what have you been doing on your time off?      Taxes. [Laughs.]      I’m so sorry, that is awful.      Yeah, that’s no way to relax, is it?      No, but at least you’re mentally giving your brain a little bit of a break off from being creative all the time … unless you feel like you’re getting creative with your taxes, which is not a good thing! When do you go back to work again?      Yes! [laughs] I think the next recording session is April 21st. Then we start recording and we do three shows in a row in three weeks. Then we’re finished for the season. For us, it’s 28. Amazing, huh?      It really is remarkable. While it’s a series that’s ingrained in pop culture, I don’t think a lot of folks realize that it’s the longest-running scripted primetime television series of all time. And you’ve been a part of this for such a long time. Do you take any time to sit and reflect on things like that, on how it is such an important part of culture?      Well, I don’t have much time to think of that. When we first put out the first Simpsons music CD, with a lot of the songs that I had written, it was on Rhino records the first time around. We worked really hard, we got the CD all finished and ready to release, it got released, and spread out to radio stations, and what not, and I did an interview with a guy who was hosting a primetime drive-time in San Francisco, in the morning, at nine o’clock. So I got on the phone with him, and he was very cordial. He said, “Let me ask you a personal question. What does it feel like to be an icon of pop culture?” And my first instinct was to turn my head 90 degrees, look over my shoulder, and see who he was talking about.      Ha! I’m not surprised. With longevity comes loyalty and legend, at the core it’s an animated series full of dramatic characters that you really do feel like family, and you have been such an integral part of it. Does your family watch the show?      Well, I don’t think they really understood it. Some of them do. Not all of them, but some of them do. I have a grandson who used to poo-poo The Simpsons when he was young, but now he’s grown up with it, and he’s eight years old, and he has watched every episode of The Simpsons. Little by little we grew into it and started to realize that something special was going on here.      Are you saying that when you first watched it, it was a little bit left field for you? Did you not relate to the humor, or did you just think it was something you’d never seen before?      To me it was pretty much the writing and the actors’ delivery of the writing that really hooked us in. Well, it’s been an amazing ride, if I can put it that way.      Were you fascinated with music from a very young age?      What’s interesting is that I started by majoring in mechanical engineering. I went to college in North Dakota at North Dakota State University, which is where I grew up. What happened was, I got a chance to go to New York City and stay with my cousin for six weeks. My cousin was a professional musician, a choir director, and a piano instructor. He and his wife just completely turned my life around. They wined and dined me in New York City for six straight weeks, and boy I’ll tell you I was just amazingly moved at all the Broadway shows I got to see, like My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, and West Side Story with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Seeing those things on Broadway for the first time, it was awe-inspiring. So, when I came back to North Dakota, I thought, Well, guess what folks: This mechanical engineering stuff is not for me. So I changed my major, and majored in music from there on. I went to Berklee College in Boston.      While they’re completely different fields, there is a certain amount of critical thinking necessary for classical composition. And then, skipping ahead, Matt Groening asked you to score a couple of episodes.      Yes, I believe it was back in 1990.      So, he called you, and did you immediately say yes?      I immediately said no.      What!      It’s a very, very interesting story. He had his secretary call my agent and had me come in for an interview. I went in and he said, “Do you have any interest in doing an animated series?” And I said, “No.” He said, “Really, why?” I said, “Basically I’ve been concentrating on dramas. I consider myself to be a drama scorer, and that’s what I want to do with my life.” He said, “Well, we look upon our show as being a drama where the characters are drawn. We’d like it scored that way, because you do that.” So, I thought about it for a while, and I said, “Yeah, I think I can do that.”      So they gave me my first episode, which was “Treehouse of Horror I”. I scored that for them, and we had a lot of music. I thought, Boy, they’re going to throw me out of here when I tell them how many players I need. I talked to Matt about it, and he said, “Whatever you want, you can have. Let’s just see how it goes.” So, they put out a call for about 45 musicians. It was really a pretty hefty number for television. But it went well, they liked what I wrote, and they kept me.      What was the reason that you felt you needed to work with so many musicians? Was it that you were hooked on the concept of it being dramatic? Or did you just feel out the music and give it what it needs.      I think it was more the latter. I was used to working with a large orchestra, and I thought they were telling me they wanted what I gave everybody else, and that’s what it took. It took 45 players. And everybody was happy about it. So then of course we start to score the series and I couldn’t have 45 players, but they gave me 35 every week, which is pretty good.      How does working with a big ensemble affect your composition?      Well, I look at the orchestra as another actor, another player. I think everybody else really feels that as well. They always tell me that there’s another player involved with the orchestra, and it adds a lot to the story line and color.      What do you feel is the correlation between the characters, the humor, and how that’s conveyed through music? Can a joke even work on its own, or do you feel that music is an integral part of that?      A long time ago a musician friend of mine gave me a saying that I’ve never forgotten. He said, “You can’t vaudeville vaudeville.” Basically what it means is that you can’t score something funny with something funny, with funny music. It doesn’t work. My take has been, every time we have something dramatic to score, that’s the way I score it. I don’t score it like Looney Tunes or anything like that. Matt told me that too. “We want to be different. We want to do something that people are not going to expect. They’re expecting Looney Tunes and Disney, and we’re not going to go there. We want to be our own voice.”      But then what is it like writing for a show that covers so many genres and time periods? There have been a lot of episodes that hit upon very specific cultural moments or even into the past, episodes set in the ’60s, the ’70s. And you have to write that music for something that has so many different narrative touch points. How is that for you?      I think that’s one of the reasons they’ve kept me all these years. They were looking for somebody who could score all those different types of music in small clip-form. That’s what’s been fun for me. I think that anyone else who would have been hired for this job and stayed for this long would have gone to the nuthouse.      [Laughs.] From one nutter to another, you sound semi-nutty to me. Is that just because it’s you have to be constantly creative?      I have to do a lot of reference work. They want my cue to reflect the moment. Most composers don’t have a very broad stylistic palette, I think that’s the best way I could put it. They like that I can go into the files in my brain and come back with the style that they’re asking for very easily.      You have to balance that nostalgia with originality and make it your own. If you get stuck and you’re busy searching through your brain-files, what do you do to push around the process?      Your observation is very good about that, because it does happen. But fortunately not very often. If it does happen, I just step away from the cue for a while, and work on another one. We have an average of 35 cues in one episode, so, there’s a lot on my plate, and if one shows up that I get really stuck with, I try not to stay there very long. I go on to take a walk in the park to clear my head.      That’s interesting. How are songs actually born? Are you given the script and then told to create the cue around that? Or are you given some sort of animation that you can visually attach your music to?      It’s the visual animation that I get. I get a copy of the episode for the week. I like working that way too, because I get to see what the public sees. That makes it a lot easier for me. I have been very careful that I don’t duplicate myself. One of our intentions on the show is to keep it fresh so that the public doesn’t feel like we’re cheating them. Once in awhile I’ll have a situation where I’m really tired and I know what I want, and I’m going to pull a cue from three years ago, and I say to myself, “Yeah, I could use that, and nobody’s ever going to know…” Well, now I find that every time I do that, one of the episodes that has that same cue in it pops up in syndication, and there’s somebody watching the show in syndication saying, “What a lazy bum, man! He’s using the same music over and over, what’s the matter with that guy?      Do you feel like you have a relationship with the various characters at this point? They are kind of like your family! Do you have a favorite character at all?      Oh, absolutely. I’ve lived with them for a long time now. I like Comic Book Guy! But there are so many characters doing so many things, it’s hard to just grab one.      Is there a specific song that sticks out?      “We Do (The Stonecutter’s Song)”      Oh, I love that one! Did it come out very quickly? That song was nominated for an Emmy as well.      It came out very quickly. Most of them come out pretty quickly because I don’t have any extra time. They have to come out pretty quickly. [Laughs.] Yeah. I’m trying to remember. I’ve got two Emmys. One for “I’m Checkin’ In” and the other one where Homer wants the house of ill repute torn down, and Bart is working there and wants to keep it….      “We Put the Spring in Springfield”! But even just in terms of Emmy nominations, you have received more than pretty much any other musician, which is quite insane.      Thirty is the number.      When the cast has to sing certain songs, do you help them in that process realize their potential?      Once in awhile I’ve had the opportunity to do that. What happens more often than not is that my music editor, Chris Ledesma, will take over the chore of conducting the vocal sessions to record the cast singing the songs, because we can’t be in two places at the same time. I’m very lucky to have somebody who understands music and who understands conducting.      You only have, as you said earlier, a few seconds to make a huge musical statement, and there’s obviously huge challenges in that. But you’ve also been a part of The Simpsons albums and worked with Jackson Browne, David Byrne, and The B-52s. Are there any artists that you’ve gotten to work with on these albums that you found very inspirational?      Tito Puente! It was great, so much fun. Tito came into the studio with his whole band. When I recorded U2, they just stayed in as a group of singers, as they are. We got a chance to hang out a bit, and that was really fun too. Boy, you can’t believe how many people were in the recording studio. Oh my!      That’s a beautiful memory. For the film adaptation of the show, were you asked to score that?      Uhh… They didn’t ask. That’s their business, but it was weird. I found out for the first time on a message board that I wasn’t going to be scoring the movie. I’ve been in that situation before. This was a little bit more big-time, if I can say that. I was kind of frustrated and curious as to why after all of those years, making all of those songs and scoring all of those episodes that they wanted to call someone else. Weird. But the important thing is to move on to the next, to the next, to the next, and we’ll see what’s going to happen. Try not to take it all too seriously. I haven’t even seen it to be honest, I had no reason to go.      You’ve dedicated your life to something that is going to be in our lives forever, whether they stop making The Simpsons or not.      Yeah, it’s pretty remarkable. The opportunity was certainly never expected and I just keep going and going. Of course, you know, my wife says, “When are you going to retire?” And I said, “I don’t know!” Because it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, I’ve said what I’m going to say musically and I don’t have to do any more. But on the other hand, I want to kind of ride this stage into the sunset, as they say, and try to see if I can finish the series.      Everybody jokes about that. There’s an episode of The Simpsons where the kids are riding in the back seat, with Marge and Homer driving, and somebody says something, and Lisa goes, you know, “Could this be the end of this series… of events?” It’s really funny, isn’t it? I will say my wife has been a miracle-worker to keep me going, to keep me alive. I give her a lot of credit.      That’s really heartfelt and beautiful to hear. What are your goals for the upcoming season?      Surviving.      Just surviving? [Laughs] What about having fun Alf?      [Laughs] Sometimes it feels that way, I hate to tell you! There’s so much to do in a short period of time, and the producers need it when they need it, and we just have to do what we do and hope it comes out the way they want. I’ve been pretty lucky so far. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"After 27 years of creating music for the popular TV show, The Simpsons, the show's composer, Alf Clausen, has been let go. This means Alf won't be making music for the show anymore, even though he has been doing so for a very long time - nearly the entire time the show has been on-air, which is a rare thing and quite special. A person from the show told Alf that they wanted a different kind of music, and while fans of The Simpsons might be surprised and sad by this change, it's not uncommon in the workplace for roles and people to change over time. Despite all his work, Alf wasn't chosen to create music for The Simpsons Movie, another big project related to the show.

Puerto Rico (Spanish for \`\`Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. \`\`Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.","output":"Yes, based on the given text, it is true that Puerto Rico is part of the United States. The text states that Puerto Rico is an \\"unincorporated territory of the United States\\" and is positioned in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles southeast of Miami, Florida.  To further understand this association, it is important to look at the historical and political context behind Puerto Rico's status.  The island of Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and later became a Spanish colony. After the conclusion of the Spanish-American War in 1898, Puerto Rico, along with Guam and the Philippines, was ceded to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Consequently, Puerto Rico came under US jurisdiction as an unincorporated territory. In 1917, the Jones-Shafroth Act granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, which meant that they became subject to U.S. laws and regulations, and Puerto Ricans were allowed to travel freely between the island and mainland. However, they do not have the same representation in the U.S. government as the residents of the states. For instance, Puerto Rico has a single, non-voting representative in the U.S. Congress, and its residents cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections. The political status of Puerto Rico was further clarified in 1952 when it became a commonwealth. This allowed the island to have a certain degree of autonomy and self-government, while still being under U.S. sovereignty. Under the commonwealth status, Puerto Rico has its own constitution, a governor elected by the island's residents, and a local legislature. Puerto Rico's status has been a topic of debate and the subject of numerous referendums. Some Puerto Ricans support the idea of becoming a fully incorporated U.S. state, which would provide them with equal representation in the United States Congress, the right to vote in presidential elections, and access to federal programs and funding. Others advocate for full independence or retaining the current commonwealth status. In conclusion, based on the provided text and the historical and political context, Puerto Rico is indeed a part of the United States as an unincorporated territory, with its inhabitants holding U.S. citizenship and the island subject to U.S. federal law. However, Puerto Rico's commonwealth status also grants it some autonomy and self-governance, which opens up ongoing debates and discussions about its ultimate political relationship with the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We need to find the value of 't' in this equation: 3*t + 116214 = 116166 First, we need to get rid of the 116214 on the left side, so we can find out what 't' is. To do that, we will subtract 116214 from both sides of the equation: 3*t + 116214 - 116214 = 116166 - 116214 This simplifies to: 3*t = -48 Now we just have 3 times 't' equals -48.

His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \\"personal reasons,\\" which he declined to specify. \\"There is no business reason for my departure,\\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \\"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \\"no change in strategy or profits.\\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \\"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company. I would be very surprised if his departure signals any change in strategy or change in profit expectations.\\" On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43). In the U.S. over-the-counter market, American depositary shares for Reuters, each representing three shares in the London market, closed unchanged at 43.875. The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director. Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs. And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs.  After reading the above, is \\"Reupke's departure has not changed the strategy or profits. The company shares rose five pence to 913 pence (14.43) and the U.S. over-the-counter market closed unchanged at 43.875\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What impact has Reupke's departure had on Reuters?\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Reupke's departure has not changed the strategy or profits.

A Primeval Passage on Caddo Lake in East Texas EVERY visitor to Caddo Lake on the Texas-Louisiana border seems to come away with a profoundly personal impression. Anglers prize Caddo, the only naturally formed lake in Texas, for its trophy bass; canoeists rate its twisting, interlocking bayous among the most challenging to navigate. Environmentalists cherish its 26,000 acres as a rare, if not singular, wetlands environment. Caddo is more of a large bayou, composed of many smaller waterways. It is home to over 200 species of birds; hundreds of kinds of mammals, reptiles and fish; and countless plants, most prominently the towering baldcypress  some as old as 400 years  that erupt from its surface like limbs of drowned giants. But what struck me about Caddo Lake the first time I saw it was the powerful suggestion of the supernatural that it evoked. Honestly, it’s kind of a creepy place. Spectral shapes shift in the mist that rises from its cilantro-colored surface; ghost stories seem to ooze from its forested shores. Spanish moss dangles like serpents from cypress branches; spooky tales lurk behind the wary eyes of egrets and rabbits. Natural beauty by itself can stop you dead in your tracks, but Caddo also works on the primal circuits. It sticks with you. That, perhaps, is why my wife, Ann, and I return every few years to the lake, which sits about 15 miles west of Shreveport, La.: to make sure that what we saw the first time really existed; and maybe to figure it out, learn from it, even befriend it. For John Winn, 48, one of the lake’s most prominent guides, Caddo has been a lifelong companion. “In a way, this lake raised me,” he said, piloting his shallow-draft Go-Devil boat through the cypresses, which in early spring were equal parts dead graying foliage and new green growth. “Most everything important I’ve ever done has been on this lake.” Among Caddo’s many mysteries is its genesis. The lake was named for the Caddo Indians, who settled in the area in the early 1600s. There are two theories of its creation: The Caddo Indians held that it was formed by an earthquake and flooding; other, more recent histories say it was the result of the Great Raft  a huge logjam in the Red River, which in the early 1800s forced enough water into Big Cypress Bayou to create the lake. At the same time, the bayou became deep and wide enough to handle big steamships, which began heading up the Mississippi from New Orleans, then northeastward on the Red River and all the way to the hamlet of Jefferson, 15 miles west of the lake. As the 19th century progressed, Jefferson became Texas’s second-largest port after Galveston, a jumping-off point for goods headed for the fast-developing West. The town boomed, and the lake was a favored hideout for criminal elements drawn to all the new money  leading to the claim that, during this era, there was a murder a day in the area. Maybe it is the ghosts of these murderers and thieves that give the lake such a preternatural spookiness: what happened at Caddo, stayed in Caddo. Sometimes, the legends around Caddo cross over into the popular imagination. “I get requests all the time for Bigfoot tours,” Mr. Winn said, stroking at a gray-and-black beard. “Fine. But I’ve been out here all my life. I know places out here that the fishes don’t know about. I’ve never seen Bigfoot.” Mr. Winn turned the Go-Devil down one of the lake’s 42 mapped and marked “boat roads” in search of the animals that definitely inhabit the lake. A spring cold snap seemed to be keeping the alligators out of sight, but we saw plenty of turtles and frogs, hawks and vultures soaring overhead. The most interesting thing we saw was a beaver dam  a good five feet high and half again as wide, banked up against a cypress tree  looking every bit as solid as an Allied bunker. “These beavers back in here will get to be 70 pounds or so, and it’s all muscle,” Mr. Winn said. “There’s not much that can stand up to one except maybe for a gator, and even they find them too tough to eat.” Like a lot of ecological treasures, Caddo has been rather routinely abused, first by that steamboat traffic in the 19th century, then again, beginning in 1910, when prospectors built the country’s first “over-water” oil rigs to tap what was hoped to be infinite reserves in East Texas. In the last 20 years, Caddo has been assaulted by more-contemporary culprits, including mercury and other pollutants from past industrial excesses. So far, with the aid of several environmental organizations, the lake’s defenders have kept much of the vicissitudes of the 21st century at bay. It is one of 26 areas in the country designated for protection by the Ramsar Convention, a 1970s treaty that seeks to protect wetlands by asking participating nations to designate, put to “best” use and, if necessary, completely protect certain areas. What was this article about?","output":"This article recounts the personal experiences and impressions of visitors to Caddo Lake, located on the Texas-Louisiana border. The lake, which is the only naturally formed lake in Texas, offers activities such as fishing, canoeing, and bird watching, while also giving the environment a unique character with its wetlands and bald cypress trees. The piece delves into the local legends and tales surrounding Caddo Lake, which is shrouded in an atmosphere of supernatural and eerie beauty. The history of Caddo Lake dates back to the early 1600s when the Caddo Indians settled in the area. It is believed to have been formed either by an earthquake and flooding, or as a result of the Great Raft, a huge log jam in the Red River. The lake played a role in the booming trade industry in the region during the 19th century, as steamships navigated its waters to reach the port town of Jefferson. Caddo Lake has faced ecological challenges throughout its history, including pollution from the steamboat traffic during the 19th century and the construction of over-water oil rigs in the early 1900s. In recent times, efforts have been made to protect the lake from further environmental damage, with the Ramsar Convention designating it as one of 26 areas in the United States for protection and preservation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. jump left after walk around right A:","output":"1. I_WALK: The command starts with \\"walk,\\" indicating the agent needs to walk first. 2. I_TURN_RIGHT: \\"around right\\" means the agent needs to turn around in the right direction after walking. 3.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"Yes, the information you found on Google is correct. To provide further clarification, the common iliac arteries divide into two parts: the internal and external iliac arteries.  The external iliac arteries, as you mentioned, bifurcate off the common iliac arteries anterior to the sacroiliac joint of the pelvis. They supply blood to the lower limbs and part of the pelvic region. As they exit the pelvis, the external iliac arteries become the femoral arteries, which continue down the thigh. The internal iliac arteries, on the other hand, are the main suppliers of blood to the pelvic region and lower abdomen. They branch off the common iliac arteries posterior to the external iliac arteries. The internal iliac arteries provide blood to several pelvic organs such as the bladder, rectum, reproductive organs, and the gluteal muscles. In summary, both the internal and external iliac arteries branch off the common iliac arteries within the pelvic region.

In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

Write some highlights for the following article: Tougher restrictions on ammunition are needed to stop British-based jihadists carrying out Paris-style gun attacks, a former security minister has said. Lord West said the UK’s tough anti-gun laws were a crucial tool in the fight against terror - but demanded further action to tighten restrictions on ammunition. The Labour peer also hit out at the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for blocking new powers for the security services and urged ministers to increase anti-terror funding. Scroll down for video. Former security minister Admiral Lord West said new powers were needed to tackle Islamist fanatics. Lord West's intervention comes amid warnings from security chiefs that up to 150 jihadists in the UK could carry out gun attacks similar to the Paris atrocities, the Sunday Times reported this morning. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning Lord West said the government’s Communications Data Bill, dubbed a ‘snoopers’ charter’ by opponents, was needed to track terrorist suspects. The bill allows the security services to monitor who people are emailing and what they are looking at online. Lord West said: ‘I think that needs to go through, and I was very irked that it was removed, in fact it was removed by the Deputy Prime Minister, when it had all been agreed across all parties.’ He added that the security services ‘need more money’ to monitor suspected terrorists amid claims that up to 150 fanatics have returned from the war in Syria intent on carrying out attacks at home. The Labour peer’s warning comes after security chiefs warned last week that Britain was being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Lord West (left) was interviewed by the BBC presenter Andrew Marr (centre) alongside the Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was open minded about giving the security services more powers to monitor people's emails. Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria – about 300 of who are now back home. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new £100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' – but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.'

'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'

No. The Highway of Hope is a silent film from the year 1917, which means that there was no synchronized recorded sound used in the film. Instead, music was usually played live accompanying the screenings. Sound effects as we understand them today were not present in silent films, as the technology to incorporate synchronized recorded sound had not yet been developed. Silent films often relied heavily on text intertitles to convey dialogue and story elements. Accompanied by live music, whether it be an orchestra, a small ensemble, a pianist or an organist, silent films created a unique atmosphere that relied on visual storytelling, music, and text to engage the audience. The era of silent films laid the foundation for narrative and visual techniques that later contributed to the sound films we know today, but the absence of audible dialogue and sound effects in The Highway of Hope means that it did not have \\"great sound effects\\" as we understand the term now.

Ask a question about this article.","output":"Why did the Red Army fight against the Polish line?"},{"instruction":"Information:  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - The Iron Cross (abbreviated EK) was a military decoration in the Kingdom of Prussia, and later in the German Empire (18711918) and Nazi Germany (19331945). It was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia in March 1813 backdated to the birthday of his late wife Queen Louise on 10 March 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars (EK 1813). Louise was the first person to receive this decoration (posthumous). The recommissioned Iron Cross was also awarded during the Franco-Prussian War (EK 1870), World War I (EK 1914), and World War II (EK 1939, re-introduced with a swastika added in the center). The Iron Cross was normally a military decoration only, though there were instances of it being awarded to civilians for performing military functions. Two examples of this were civilian test pilots Hanna Reitsch who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class and Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, who was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class, for their actions as pilots during World War II.  - Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (9 January 1903  8 April 1945), was a German Aviator who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Erich Walther ( 5 August 1903 -- 26 December 1947 ) was a German general of the Fallschirmjäger who served during World War II. He was also a recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves and Swords was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership .  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate  better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Question: Why do young people seem more willing to take adventures?

Answer a question about this article: The history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic (the last 540 million years), starts with rapid growth during the Cambrian explosion—a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared. Over the next 400 million years or so, invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend, and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend. This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic, massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events. A significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous. The worst was the Permian-Triassic extinction event, 251 million years ago. Vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event. What type of diversity showed an overall exponential trend?","output":"To answer the question, let's follow the information given in the article step-by-step: 1. The article discusses the history of biodiversity during the Phanerozoic, which covers the last 540 million years. 2.

Process:  - A mushroom gives off gills lined with basidia - The basidia gives off spores - The spores germinate - The spores create Hyphae - Multiple Hyphae meet and converge - They join with Mycelium - A hyphal knot forms in the ground - A primordia shoots out of the ground - A mushroom cap is formed.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no bread for the mold to attach to happens, how will it affect more hyphal knots form in the ground.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The given process describes the life cycle of a mushroom, which is a type of fungi. On the other hand, the perturbation hypothesis refers to a scenario where there is no bread for mold to attach to. To clarify the context, it is essential to understand that mold is a different group of fungi, and the life cycle/process mentioned above is not directly applicable to mold. Molds usually grow on organic matter like bread and rely on it as a source of nutrition for their growth and reproduction. They release enzymes to break down the available organic matter into simpler compounds, which they absorb for sustenance. Then, they produce spores, which are spread through the air and land on suitable surfaces to continue the mold growth cycle. Considering the perturbation hypothesis, let's analyze the effect of no bread (or the absence of a suitable substrate for mold) on the formation of hyphal knots in mushrooms: Since mold and mushrooms are both categorized as fungi, they have some similarities in their life cycles, particularly in the formation of hyphae and mycelium. However, they also have notable differences. Mushrooms usually grow in natural environments, thriving on decaying plant material, and do not require specific substrates like bread to develop. On the other hand, molds typically grow on moist organic matter, including bread, fruit, and other food items. Given the differences in their growth requirements, if no bread is available for mold to attach to, it has no direct impact on the formation of hyphal knots for mushroom growth. Mushrooms can still develop hyphal knots and progress through their life cycle using other organic materials in the environment, such as decaying plant matter. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of no bread for mold to attach to does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of hyphal knot formation in mushrooms. Both mushrooms and molds are fungi, but they exhibit different growth requirements and thrive in different environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? another visit","output":"Analyzing the phrase \\"another visit\\" in isolation makes it difficult for determining if it is positive or negative, as it largely depends on the context in which it is used, and the emotions, experiences, and opinions associated with the visit. Here are a few possible scenarios to consider: 1. Positive sentiment: If the phrase \\"another visit\\" refers to a situation in which the speaker enjoys the company of the person being visited or appreciates the specific location they visit, then it can be considered as having a positive connotation. For example, visiting a close friend, a family member, or a favorite vacation spot would be situations where \\"another visit\\" is a favorable event. In such cases, \\"another visit\\" can imply looking forward to spending time in a familiar, enjoyable, or comforting environment. 2. Negative sentiment: However, if the phrase \\"another visit\\" involves an encounter with an unpleasant or difficult individual or visiting a location that has negative associations, then it can be considered as having a negative connotation. For instance, if someone is talking about making another visit to a doctor's office where the medical treatments have been painful or uncomfortable, the phrase would have a negative tone. Similarly, visiting a place that holds bad memories, such as a childhood home filled with negative experiences, could also create an unfavorable perspective on \\"another visit.\\" 3. Neutral sentiment: In some cases, \\"another visit\\" may not carry any strong positive or negative implications, but rather be perceived as a neutral statement. For example, if a person is discussing routine visits to a location for work purposes, this might not evoke strong emotions. In situations like these, \\"another visit\\" is simply describing an event or action without carrying significant emotional weight. Ultimately, the positivity or negativity of the phrase \\"another visit\\" is dependent on the context it is placed in, the emotions tied to the specific visit, and the relationships and experiences connected to that particular encounter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under their commercial agreement after their relations were strained following disagreement over policy in Romania, the Soviet war with Finland, Germany falling behind in its deliveries of goods under the pact and with Stalin worried that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders, settled some Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its air battle with Germany and the execution of an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases.

Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Content: The review seems to be focused on a specific issue that the user is facing, which is that their game (presumably \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\") is not working properly. This suggests a negative experience, and they might be seeking assistance. However, the content of the review is minimal and does not provide enough information about the problem. For instance, it does not provide details about the device they are using, the nature of the issue (e.g., crashes, freezes, etc.), or any steps they have tried to resolve it. This makes it difficult for others to understand the root of the problem and provide help. Rating: 2/5 2. Clarity: The clarity of the review is not optimal, as grammatical errors and word choices make it difficult to understand the core message. For example, \\"My games has not working like\\" should potentially be \\"My game is not working like.\\" Additionally, the title of the game \\"Gunship Battle: Second War\\" is not correctly formatted. It could lead to confusion for those who are not familiar with the game or misinterpret the issue being addressed. Rating: 1/5 3. Helpfulness: As mentioned earlier, the review lacks essential details about the problem, making it hard for other users or developers to provide support or solutions. A helpful review would include information about the device being used, the nature of the issue, and any troubleshooting steps taken before writing the review. Since it does not have these elements, it is of very limited use for other users or the game's developer. Rating: 1/5 Taking all of these factors into account, we can rate this review as follows: Average Rating: (2+1+1)/3 = 1.33 To round off this rating to the nearest whole number on a scale of 1-5, we can conclude that this review scores a 1 out of 5. This reflects that the review is least favorable in terms of content, clarity, and helpfulness. A more effective review would provide a detailed description of the issue, proper grammar, and additional information that would allow others to better understand and potentially offer appropriate solutions to the problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir apparent to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year. Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball, and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom. The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.  It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations. The king set out by the River Thames on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower. The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End. The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings. Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and William Walworth, the mayor of London, pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him. The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying \\"I am your captain, follow me!\\", he led the mob away from the scene. Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.  The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.

Pupils from All Saints Primary School have been working with Bradford University students to produce a documentary on bullying awareness. Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, said: \\"We don't want other children to suffer what he had to suffer.\\" She said there was \\"a lesson to be learnt from his tragic death\\" and made an appeal to bullies. \\"I don't know what Asad went through, but please don't do it to any other young child. \\"We had no idea he was suffering from bullying because at home he was just [his usual self] running around, playing and being very talkative... if we had a slight idea that he was, things would've been different.\\" More on this story and others from across Yorkshire Project Coordinator Sabeen Raja said the film was a good tribute to the 11-year-old. \\"I think it's a good way for the children to see the impact that bullying may have and I think it's a good way to remember him, to know that he didn't leave in a way without something being done about it.\\" Hundreds of people attended his funeral last year and his death affected the local community with more than 200 people gathering at a centre in Girlington in October to offer support and discuss the issue of bullying.

He was taken to hospital but died a short time later.","output":"Last September, Asad Khan, a young boy from Bradford, passed away. His family believes that bullying was a contributing factor in his tragic death. Since then, students from All Saints Primary School and Bradford University have collaborated to create a documentary aiming to raise awareness about the devastating effects of bullying.  Asad's cousin, Farah Naz, shared her thoughts about Asad's experience, expressing that she hopes no other child has to endure the pain and suffering that Asad had to go through. She also mentioned that if the family had been aware of the bullying issues, things might have been different. Asad's usual behavior at home, running around and playing, did not reveal any signs of suffering or bullying. Sabeen Raja, the project coordinator, felt that the film was a fitting tribute to Asad, who was only 11 years old at the time of his passing. The documentary serves to demonstrate the immense impact that bullying can have on a young life. Importantly, it also ensures that something positive is done in the wake of such a tragic event, which has left an indelible mark on the community. Asad's death was deeply felt by the local community. Hundreds of people attended his funeral, and over 200 people gathered in Girlington the following October to offer their support and share their thoughts on the issue of bullying. Asad was found unresponsive in his home on Tile Street by his mother, and despite being immediately taken to the hospital, he passed away shortly after. This heart-rending incident serves as a reminder of the grave harm that bullying can cause, and the importance of developing and promoting empathy, kindness, and understanding in order to prevent such tragedies in the future. By sharing Asad's story, those working on the documentary hope to foster change and protect other young lives from experiencing this unwarranted pain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: text Aubrey back, spend time alone, be expecting something Answer:","output":"In the given context, it can be deduced that Cameron will likely return Aubrey's phone call since Aubrey is awaiting a response. Although it is not explicitly mentioned what Cameron is doing or what his intentions are, we can make an educated guess based on the provided information.  Aubrey is awaiting a response which suggests that their relationship or friendship holds some importance. Friends and people who care for one another generally reply to missed calls or messages in a timely manner, so it is reasonable to believe that Cameron will be returning Aubrey's call eventually. It is evident that communication is expected between the two of them. Moreover, the possible answer \\"text Aubrey back\\" suggests an alternate means for Cameron to get back to Aubrey, but since Aubrey is waiting for a phone call, it's more likely that Cameron will call her back instead of texting. Providing a response through a text message may be less personal and might not be the preferred method of addressing the matter at hand. The other possible answers, \\"spend time alone\\" and \\"be expecting something,\\" do not directly relate to Aubrey's anticipation of Cameron's phone call. Spending time alone does not provide any insight into Cameron returning Aubrey's call, as it could simply be an unrelated action or a way for Cameron to reflect on what to say later. Additionally, \\"be expecting something\\" could relate to Cameron's anticipation of an outcome, but this too doesn't indicate whether or not he will be returning Aubrey's call. Based on the given context, the most likely and detailed answer would be that Cameron will return Aubrey's phone call once he becomes available or finds a suitable time to get in touch. This action will maintain their communication and address the matter that prompted Aubrey's initial call.

I read this background article the other day: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which coat would most likely become more common, darker or lighter? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article on natural selection, it is likely that the darker coat will become more common among squirrels in Mike's cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction.  The reason for this is that darker coats are more suitable for colder environments, as they can absorb more sunlight and provide better insulation, helping the squirrels to stay warm and maintain their body temperature. Since the environment in Mike's city is cold, squirrels with darker coats would have an advantage over those with lighter coats in terms of survival and reproduction. As a result, natural selection would cause the beneficial trait of having a darker coat to become more common in the squirrel population over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Choose from: +no. +yes.","output":"+no. While these two questions are related, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about the specifics of how the Ottomans conquered Constantinople, while the second question inquires about the broader impact the Ottomans had on history. To answer the first question: The Ottomans conquered Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, on May 29, 1453, under the leadership of Sultan Mehmed II. The siege of Constantin-ople lasted for 53 days and was a turning point in history, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire and the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's dominance in the region. Several factors contributed to the successful Ottoman conquest of Constantinople: 1. Preparation and planning: Mehmed II meticulously prepared for the siege by stockpiling weapons, gathering a large, well-trained army, and developing a detailed strategy. The overall force consisted of around 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers, with a mix of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. 2. Technological advantage: The Ottomans utilized advanced weaponry, specifically powerful, large-scale siege cannons. These cannons could fire massive stone projectiles that could penetrate the city's walls. The largest cannon, called the \\"Basilica,\\" had a barrel 27 feet long and required more than 1,000 pounds of gunpowder per shot. 3. Naval blockade: Sultan Mehmed II ordered a naval blockade to cut off Constantinople's access to outside supplies and reinforcements. The Ottoman fleet successfully stopped any Byzantine ships from entering or leaving the city's harbor, which slowly weakened the defenders' resolve. 4. Weak Byzantine defenses: Constantinople's walls were still formidable; however, the city had been in decline, and its defenses suffered from lack of maintenance and insufficient manpower. Additionally, the Byzantine Empire did not receive the support and reinforcements it needed from European allies due to a lack of unity among Christian nations. 5. Final assault: The decisive attack on the city was launched on May 29, 1453. Mehmed II ordered a multi-front assault, attacking along the entire length of the land walls and creating an overwhelming offensive force. After hours of intense combat, Ottoman troops breached the walls and entered the city, ultimately leading to the fall of Constantinople. To answer the second question: The Ottomans changed history in several ways through their conquests and governance of their vast empire: 1. Fusion of cultures: The Ottoman Empire comprised diverse territories and ethnicities within its borders, which resulted in a fusion of cultures. Art, architecture, science, and literature benefitted from the blending of Byzantine, Persian, and Islamic influences throughout the empire. 2. Trade: The Ottomans strategically controlled key trade routes between Europe and Asia, including the Silk Road. This enabled the Ottomans to influence global trade, encourage cultural exchange, and accumulate wealth. 3. Religion: The conquest of Constantinople and subsequent expansion of the Ottoman Empire marked the spread of Islam throughout southeastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. However, the Ottomans were often tolerant of other religions within their empire, fostering a relatively peaceful coexistence among different faiths. 4. Military advancements: The Ottomans had a highly effective and well-disciplined military force, incorporating innovations in warfare, such as the aforementioned cannons. These advancements not only contributed to the Ottoman Empire's expansions but also influenced other military powers in Europe at the time. 5. Decline of feudalism: The Ottomans' centralized, bureaucratic government system contributed to the decline of feudalism in Europe. As the empire expanded into Europe, feudal lords who once held significant power found themselves subordinate to the centralized authority of the Ottoman Empire or losing territories altogether. In conclusion, these two questions address different aspects of the Ottoman Empire's impact on history. The first question pertains to the specific events surrounding the conquest of Constantinople, while the second question concerns the broad and long-lasting effects of the Ottoman Empire on world history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\".

Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August...

Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  Please answer this question : Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?","output":"In order to answer this question, let's first review the given information and recall Le Châtelier's principle, which states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a stress, the system will attempt to counteract the stress by adjusting the equilibrium until a new balance is established. In cases A and B, both represent disturbed equilibriums with different stress factors that favored either the forward or the reverse reactions. In case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that the reactants are being consumed to form products at a faster rate than the reverse reaction. As a result of this disturbance, the system is no longer at equilibrium and will attempt to re-establish equilibrium by favoring the forward reaction. Consequently, the concentration of the reactants will decrease, and the concentration of the products will increase. The chemical system will continue to shift in this direction until a new equilibrium is reached. In case B, the reverse reaction is favored. This means that the products are being consumed to form reactants at a faster rate than the forward reaction. The disturbance in equilibrium causes the system to respond by favoring the reverse reaction. This will result in an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products. The chemical system will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is established. To address the question, in case A, the concentration of the reactants would decrease compared to case B, where the concentration of the reactants would increase.

Was this review given positively or negatively?","output":"This review is leaning towards negative, although it does contain a slight positive element. The negative aspects of the review are that the shuttle service was not punctual, as it arrived over 45 minutes late, causing inconvenience. Additionally, an even worse experience is mentioned, where two girls had to wait for almost 2 hours because their bus never came. Implicitly, this highlights that reliability is an issue with this particular shuttle service, which contributes to the overall negative tone of the review. However, the slight positive element is the acknowledgment that the reviewer's own experience was not as bad as that of the two girls, which demonstrates an understanding that things could have been worse. Although this does not negate the negative aspects of the review, it provides a small sense of relief or gratitude for the fact that the reviewer's experience was not as disastrous as it could have been."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer is:","output":"walking away from beach To provide a detailed explanation, let's first analyze the question and the given options. The question presents a scenario in which Sue is walking on the beach and mentions a specific action: \\"As she walks away from the ocean.\\" The task is then to complete the statement concerning her ability to hear the waves on the shore as she carries out this action. We are given two choices: (A) harder or (B) easier. Now, let's consider the scenario more closely. Sue is walking away from the ocean, which means she is moving in a direction that increases the distance between her and the source of the sound, in this case, the waves on the shore. Sound waves, like any other wave, lose energy as they travel due to several factors, including dispersion and energy dissipation. As a result, the intensity of the sound waves decreases as the distance from the source increases, making it more challenging for a listener to perceive the sound clearly. According to this explanation, as Sue continues to walk away from the ocean, the intensity of the sound waves she hears from the waves on the shore will gradually decrease. Consequently, her ability to hear these waves will be diminished, making it (A) harder for her to hear the waves on the shore.

A: Choose your answer from: (I) arctic (II) deserts (III) forests (IV) in the oceans A:","output":"Plankton, nekton, and benthos are all terms used to describe various types of organisms that live primarily within aquatic environments. These organisms are categorized based on their ability to move and their preferred habitat within the water. To answer your question, we will look at each of the four options provided and identify which one corresponds to these three groups of organisms. I) Arctic While the Arctic is a region characterized by freezing temperatures, ice, and snow, it does contain aquatic environments such as the Arctic Ocean, where some plankton, nekton, and benthos can be found. However, the Arctic environment is not exclusive to these organisms, nor is it their primary habitat. II) Deserts Deserts are characterized by their arid and dry conditions, making them unsuitable habitats for plankton, nekton, and benthos. While some desert aquatic systems, such as oases or ephemeral rivers, may support limited aquatic life, this option would not be considered their primary habitat. III) Forests Although forests may contain bodies of water like lakes, rivers, and streams, these habitats alone would not be a primary location for plankton, nekton, and benthos. The majority of organisms found in forest ecosystems consist of terrestrial plants and animals rather than aquatic organisms. IV) In the oceans This is the correct answer. Plankton, nekton, and benthos predominantly reside in oceanic environments. Plankton refers to aquatic organisms that drift passively with water currents. They can be divided into two main groups: phytoplankton (photosynthesizing microscopic plants) and zooplankton (tiny animals that feed on phytoplankton or other zooplankton). Nekton includes more mobile and active aquatic creatures such as fish, squid, and marine mammals that can swim against currents or move independently. Benthos refers to organisms that live on, in, or near the ocean floor, such as crabs, clams, sea anemones, and various types of worms. In summary, plankton, nekton, and benthos primarily live in oceanic environments, making option (IV) the correct choice. Although some of these organisms can be found in other aquatic environments or ecosystems, the ocean is the primary habitat best suited for their survival and growth."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs.  Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect more eggs hatch.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","output":"To approach this task, we need to evaluate the impact of human interference on the bird's lifecycle mentioned in the process. Here's the step-by-step approach: 1) Understanding the scenario: The scenario details the life cycle of a bird, from laying eggs to the next generation of birds. We need to predict the effect of minimal human interference on the number of eggs hatching. 2) Considering biological factors: In a natural environment without human interference, birds will follow their normal lifecycle - laying eggs, the emergence of baby birds, their growth, finding a mate, nest-building, and laying eggs by the next generation. Essentially, birds have evolved to do this on their own. 3) Considering the impact of human interference: Human interference can have both negative and positive impacts on a bird’s life. On the negative side, it could lead to habitat destruction, disturbance during nesting, or even direct harm to the birds, which could decrease the chance of eggs hatching or the survival of the chicks. On the positive side, the human activity might involve providing safe nesting places, providing food, or protecting birds from predators, which could increase the chances of survival. 4) Thinking about reduced human interference, it is plausible that based on the positive impacts mentioned earlier, less human activity could potentially lead to a decline in the number of eggs hatching, since there would be less protection and aid given to the birds. However, decreasing human activity would also mean less of the negative impacts, like birds’ habitat destruction, and thus could potentially be beneficial for the birds. 5) Evaluating the likely outcome: This question is somewhat complex as it depends on the kind of human interference the bird populations are subjected to. If human interference majorly involves negative impacts like habitat destruction, less interference would mean more birds surviving and hence, more eggs hatching. Alternatively, if human interference is primarily protective, less interference could lead to fewer eggs hatching.  However, since most wild birds have naturally evolved to survive without human assistance, and the negative human impact due to urbanization and deforestation is generally more widespread, it is likely that with very little human interference, the hatching of eggs for wild birds may increase.

The statement above discusses the comparison of outcomes between two models, the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model and the modified \\"Cam clay\\" model, in predicting soil behavior. These models are employed to analyze and predict the behavior of soil when it is unstructured or not organized in a specific manner. The \\"S-CLAY1\\" model is noted for its simplicity, which can be advantageous when attempting to develop a model that is easily understood and can generate reliable predictions without excessive complexity. This quality makes the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model an attractive option for soil behavior analysis and could contribute to the development of better soil management strategies. On the other hand, the modified \\"Cam clay\\" model is also a prominent choice when addressing soil behavior prediction. The \\"Cam clay\\" model is based on a mechanistic approach, taking into account the macroscopic behavior of soils and their microscopic composition, which may result in a more detailed and potentially, more accurate representation of the actual behavior of various soil types. In comparing the test results and predictions produced by both of these models, it has been observed that, despite the relatively simple nature of the \\"S-CLAY1\\" model, it is still capable of generating excellent predictions of unstructured soil behavior.

Write some highlights for the following article: Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown and got his girlfriend to pose as her so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. The married lover of a millionaire heiress murdered her before getting his dinner lady girlfriend to pose as the dead woman so he could steal hundreds of thousands of pounds from her family. Donald Graham murdered Janet Brown in 2005 and went on to steal £585,000 from her estate, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle and pay for sports cars. After killing Miss Brown, with whom he had been in a long relationship despite being married to someone else, Graham got a third woman to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Miss Brown's body has not been found. After murdering Miss Brown, Graham plundered the dead woman's savings and sold her assets - which he used to treat himself to a Ferrari, a Porsche and an Alfa Romeo. He then turned his greedy intentions on her elderly parents and started siphoning their cash, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Days after murdering Miss Brown, he met school dinner lady Elizabeth Todd and used some of the stolen money to buy her a house. When the killer's string of lies looked like they were about to unravel, Graham convinced Todd, who was today sentenced for fraud, to write two letters to Miss Brown's father's bank, posing as the dead woman, to request a cash transfer into his account. The 52-year-old mother, who lived in a council flat before she met Graham, also made two telephone calls under the guise of Miss Brown to a care home where a friend of hers worked and left messages under the dead woman's name in a bid to keep up the claim she was still alive. Miss Brown vanished in May 2005 and Graham convinced her friends and loved ones she had moved away abroad to start a new life. It was almost a decade later, after both of her parents died, that the sad truth of what happened to her emerged. Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for her murder. After killing Miss Brown (left), Graham got his girlfriend Elizabeth Todd (right) to pose as her so she could ask the dead woman's father for more cash. Todd, of Seaton Deleval, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. Judge John Evans sentenced her to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. The judge said: 'It is a tragic tale of repeated manipulation, naked exploitation, betrayal and greed which befell Janet Brown and ultimately her vulnerable parents at the hands of a ruthless killer. 'It ended with the untimely death, the cold-blooded murder, of Janet Brown. 'Your part in this appalling tale was, I accept, as do the crown, limited. 'It needs to be recognised, it is accepted you did not know the truth about Janet. Had you done so, had that been established, I would have had to approach the question of sentence on a very different basis.' Judge Evans said he accepted Todd was 'vulnerable and naïve' when she 'blindly carried out his directions'. Glen Gatland, defending, said Todd could have been preyed on by the callous killer because of her physical resemblance to Miss Brown. Mr Gatland said: 'There is evidence he tired to persuade Elizabeth Todd, very shortly after their first meetings, to have her hair dyed to the same colour.' The court heard Todd believed Graham, who would profess his 'love and devotion' to her, would one day marry her - a belief that was backed up when he bought two engagement rings. Mr Gatland added: 'He was a very, very skillful conman, he was able to lead Elizabeth Todd up the garden path. He is skillful at using women. 'Elizabeth Todd believed Janet Brown was overseas and working. She genuinely believed what Donald Graham was telling her.' Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for Miss Brown's murder. Graham, 60, who lived with his wife Denise, sent letters and cards to Miss Brown's parents after he killed her, claiming to be Janet and telling them she had settled in Europe. He then went about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. After the death of Janet's mother, Graham even took her father shopping each week while defrauding the family of hundreds of thousands of pounds. During the murder trial, the court heard he created a fake will for Janet's elderly father Eric Brown, which would leave his estate - Plane Trees Estate, in Hexham, Northumberland, to Graham. Eric Brown's will originally left all of his assets to Janet, but in the circumstance that he outlived her everything would be left to the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity. The court how Janet Brown and Elizabeth Todd had both been listed as witnesses on the fake will in which Graham forged Eric Browns signature. Skipton Building Society noticed suspicious activity on Eric Brown's account in 2009 and stopped the transaction of a cheque from Eric Brown to Donald Graham's account. This led to Graham writing letters to the bank claiming to be Eric and Janet Brown, although they were both dead. Todd admitted writing two of the letters, claiming to be Miss Brown and requesting cash be transferred immediately. When Graham was interviewed by police he claimed he was the joint executor of Eric Brown's will with Janet Brown. Donald Graham, of Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, was charged with 19 offences in September 13, 2013, nearly four years after the investigation began. He was charged with murder, two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, 13 counts of fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud and perverting the course of justice. Todd pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice and was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) He first appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on September 17 2013 and pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 10 2014. Graham changed his plea on March 14 and admitted 18 fraud offences against Janet Brown and her parents. He denied murder and preventing the course of justice but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court found him guilty of both counts on June 19. The total amount that Graham gained during the fraud was £585,000. Janet Brown lived with her elderly parents Olive and Eric Brown in a converted barn on her parents estate Plane Trees Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland. She had been planning to go on holiday in June 2005 to France with Graham, her lover of eight years. Graham cancelled at the last minute falsely claiming his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Janet told a friend that Graham had 'let her down'. However Graham had secretly met another girlfriend - Todd - and was no longer interested in Janet Brown, only her finances. Janet disappeared before she went on holiday and has not been seen since.","output":"- Donald Graham murdered millionaire heiress Janet Brown in 2005 and stole £585,000 from her estate to fund his lavish lifestyle. - Graham convinced Elizabeth Todd, his girlfriend, to pose as the deceased Janet Brown and defraud even more money from her family. - Janet Brown's body has never been found and her disappearance remained a mystery for almost a decade after her death. - Elizabeth Todd was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision after pleading guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. - Graham is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 32 years for the murder of Janet Brown."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

Air is brought in through the mouth: When a person breathes in, air is taken in through the mouth or nose, where it is filtered and humidified to prevent damage to the delicate tissues in the respiratory system. If more air is entering the bronchial tissue, this could indicate a larger volume of air is being inhaled, possibly through deeper breaths or an increased respiratory rate. 2. Air passes through the lungs: After entering the mouth, air travels through the trachea and into the bronchial tubes, which branch off into smaller airways called bronchioles. These bronchioles eventually lead to tiny, balloon-like structures called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries, which is where gas exchange occurs. If more air is present in the bronchial tissue, it suggests that more inhaled air is reaching the alveoli, which could potentially allow for a greater amount of oxygen to cross the alveolar membrane into the capillaries. 3. Carbon dioxide is removed: In the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the inhaled air into the capillaries, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled. The increased air in the bronchial tissue could mean that there is a larger amount of residual air left in the alveoli after exhalation, which may increase the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air sacs, subsequently making it more challenging for carbon dioxide to be expelled. 4. The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body: Oxygen that has entered the bloodstream binds with hemoglobin in red blood cells, which are then transported to cells throughout the body by the circulatory system. If more oxygen is available in the alveoli due to the increased air in the bronchial tissue, this could theoretically lead to a greater saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, thereby delivering more oxygen to the tissues and organs. In conclusion, the perturbation of more air entering the bronchial tissue could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process. The direct effect would be the increased oxygen availability in the alveoli, which may lead to greater oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. However, there could also be indirect consequences, such as a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli, which could make it more difficult for the body to expel carbon dioxide. It would be important to consider how the individual's respiratory and circulatory systems respond to these changes and adapt to maintain a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"cell division is how organisms grow and repair themselves\\" and \\"mitosis is cell division\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? OPTIONS: (I). complex. (II). gametes. (III). recycling. (IV). mechanical. (V). Microscope. (VI). mitosis. (VII). meiosis. (VIII). atoms. The answer is:","output":"(VI). mitosis. Based on the hints provided by the teacher, we can gather that the process by which organisms grow and repair themselves is cell division, and that mitosis is a type of cell division. To briefly explain further, mitosis is the process where the nucleus of a cell is divided into two identical nuclei, each with the same number of chromosomes as the original cell. This process involves several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromosomes condense, and the mitotic spindle begins to form. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plate, and the spindle fibers attach to the centromeres. In anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the spindle fibers towards opposite poles. Finally, during telophase, the separated chromatids reach the poles, the nuclear envelope re-forms around each set of newly-forming sister chromatids, and the chromosomes begin to uncoil, eventually completing the mitosis process. One key function of mitosis is growth, which occurs as the number of cells within an organism increases. New cells are created through mitosis to replace old or damaged ones, which in turn helps repair tissues and organs in the body. This process is crucial for the continuous growth and development of organisms, as well as for the maintenance of their overall health and well-being. In contrast, meiosis is another type of cell division that produces cells with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell (gametes). This process is essential for the formation of sex cells during sexual reproduction, ensuring that the offspring maintain the correct number of chromosomes when the sperm and egg cells unite. However, it is not related to the growth and repair of organisms, which is why the teacher specifically pointed out mitosis as the answer. Given the information provided by the teacher, the best answer to the quiz question \\"How do organisms grow and repair themselves?\\" is (VI). mitosis, as it directly relates to the growth and repair processes in organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive.

The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album.  In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \\"Sad Song\\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts.  The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \\"Sad Song\\", was released to radio stations March 1. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August.  Though the Cars have not broken up, they have been inactive since the tour's conclusion in 2011, and their website has not been updated since that time. Though on April 28, 2016 Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q & A with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 has also seen a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl. Ocasek supervised the remastering. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What can you tell me about the album \\"Move Like This\\"?","output":"The album \\"Move Like This\\" is by The Cars, an American rock band.

Title: Fatal Beauty Movie plot: Detective Rita Rizzoli (Whoopi Goldberg) is an undercover narcotics police officer who stages an undercover buy with drug dealer Tito Delgadillo, when during the bust she sees her friend and informant Charlene being dragged out of the bar by her pimp and runs to her aid, alerting Delgadillo of being an undercover cop. After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp, Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing. Delgadillo retreats to a warehouse in Los Angeles where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported cocaine stamped with the gang's brand name \\"Fatal Beauty\\". One worker, however, has been sampling too much of the drug and, in his intoxicated state, prepares envelopes with a fatally high concentration of cocaine and a misaligned stamp. Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner (Brad Dourif and Mike Jolly) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product.Back at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss, Lt. Kellerman (John P. Ryan), for ruining the bust when he receives a call in which Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made. At the warehouse Rizzoli identifies Delgadillo as the only victim whom authorities weren't able to identify because his face was mutilated during the attack by pointing out the diamond pinkie ring on his finger bearing his initials that he showed Rizzoli earlier that evening. Rizzoli also discovers traces of Fatal Beauty and Charlie Dawson's body, which was stuffed in a van labeled \\"Kroll Enterprises\\".

Maybe we should find our own way and not follow the crowd. Everyone wants to wear top brand clothing.

Answer the following question: Process:  - The thermostat senses that the temperature has dropped - A signal is sent to the heating system - Heating oil travels from the tank to the burner - The oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The oil/air combination is injected into the burner - The burner is ignited in the combustion chamber - The furnace heats the air - The blower sends the heated air through the ducts - The heated air comes out the vents and into the room.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more heat in the furnace happens, how will it affect MORE heat for the house.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to an increase in heat within the furnace beyond its usual operating temperature. If more heat is generated in the furnace, it may potentially have various effects on the overall heating process for the house.  1. Direct effect: If the furnace produces more heat, the air being heated within the furnace will reach higher temperatures. As a result, the blower will distribute this warmer air throughout the ducts, which will eventually exit through the vents into the room. This warmer air may lead to a quicker increase in the room temperature. However, this would only be more effective up to a certain point, as an overheated furnace can pose safety risks and damage the system. 2. Indirect effect: While an increase in heat generation within the furnace may initially contribute to more heat for the house, it could eventually lead to several negative consequences. Overheating can cause components within the furnace to wear out or malfunction sooner, which could ultimately decrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the heating system. Additionally, an overheated furnace can pose a fire hazard and compromise the safety of the occupants. 3. Thermostat control: The thermostat is designed to sense when the desired temperature has been reached and send a signal to the heating system to stop producing more heat. If the furnace is generating more heat than needed, the thermostat will work to regulate the system and maintain the desired temperature in the room. This implies that even if more heat is produced in the furnace, the thermostat will counteract this excessive heat generation to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more heat in the furnace may have a direct positive effect on the heating process for the house up to a certain point. However, it also has potential indirect effects, such as damaging the heating system components or posing safety risks. Therefore, it's important to ensure proper furnace maintenance and operation to avoid these issues and maintain an effective and efficient heating system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person that drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments? is inside the article: The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind while he awaited trial. His limousine driver and a witness to the arrest, Louis Goldblatt, described him as \\"genuinely dumbfounded by the whole affair.\\" Tour manager Eric Barrett said that he looked \\"as if there had been a plane crash\\". Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek described the incident as \\"a nightmare which ... plagued\\" him for seven months. According to Redding, \\"the bust knocked any positive feelings Jimi was holding onto out of him\\" and that he was in \\"agonised suspense\\" from the arrest until the trial. In 2012, Plummer wrote: \\"The real possibility of prison hung over Hendrix like a spectre ... a threat to his career and the cause of much brooding and rumination.\\" Journalist Charles Shaar Murray asserted that the incident jeopardized what he described as \\"Hendrix's increasingly fragile peace of mind\\". Two weeks after the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: \\"Whatever I have done ... getting hooked on heroin is not one of them.\\" He explained that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something he should get involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: \\"All of that is the establishment fighting back ... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along.\\"According to Shapiro and Glebbeek, in 1969 there was little confidence in the staying power of rock stars; it was assumed that their careers were going to be short, and industry insiders operated under a \\"take the money and run\\" mentality.

The critic also criticizes the story, implying a lack of creativity on the part of the filmmakers. They have a particular gripe with the director of the movie, suggesting that he should stick to acting, rather than directing, indicating that they think his directing skills are subpar. They do give minimal praise to Fred Durst saying he seemed better than the rest of the cast, however this brief positive comment is outweighed by their overarching negative view of the film. When speaking of the execution they call it 'a weak example of what bad cinema looks like', which further emphasizes their disapproval. Their final advice to others is to avoid watching this movie, as they believe it to be a complete waste of time and they warn that it could be a traumatic experience.

Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of The Seven and Five Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to Paris and their contact with leading progressive artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Arp and Alberto Giacometti. Moore flirted with Surrealism, joining Paul Nash's modern art movement \\"Unit One\\", in 1933. In 1934, Moore visited Spain; he visited the cave of Altamira (which he described as the \\"Royal Academy of Cave Painting\\"), Madrid, Toledo and Pamplona.Moore and Nash were on the organising committee of the International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings. In 1938, Moore met Kenneth Clark for the first time. From this time, Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore's work, and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain he secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist., what would be the answer ?

For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

Would \\"In statistics and probability theory , standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average ( mean ), or expected value.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Standard deviation, represented by the symbol sigma (σ), is a key concept in statistics and probability theory. It is a measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values from their mean (average) value. In simpler terms, the standard deviation helps to determine the spread of data points in a dataset and provides an insight into its overall consistency. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely packed around the mean, whereas a large standard deviation suggests that the data points are more dispersed. The answer provided, \\"In statistics and probability theory, standard deviation (represented by the symbol sigma, σ) shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average (mean), or expected value,\\" is indeed a reasonable response as it encapsulates the basic definition of standard deviation. However, to better understand the importance and application of this concept, it is essential to delve into further detail. Standard deviation is typically calculated using the following steps: 1. Compute the mean (average) of the dataset. 2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result. This calculates the squared difference for each data point. 3. Find the average of these squared differences. This is called the variance. 4. Take the square root of the variance, resulting in the standard deviation. There are two primary types of standard deviations – population standard deviation and sample standard deviation.  - Population standard deviation applies to the complete dataset and is a fixed parameter that does not depend on the sample chosen. It is generally denoted by the lowercase Greek letter sigma (σ). - Sample standard deviation, on the other hand, is an estimate of the population standard deviation derived from a specific sample of the dataset. It is generally represented by the lowercase letter s. Standard deviation is an essential tool for statisticians and researchers as it allows them to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample. It is used in various contexts, such as hypothesis testing, quality control, finance, and investment analysis, to name a few. The concept enables analysts to gauge the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with a particular dataset, ultimately aiding in the interpretation of results and decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on July 9, 1937, in Bradford, England, Hockney is one of the most influential British artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Although he gained prominence as one of the pioneers of the British Pop Art movement in the early 1960s, Hockney's work spans a diverse range of styles, media, and subject matters.  David Hockney studied at the Bradford College of Art from 1953 to 1957 before moving on to the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London from 1959 to 1962. Alongside fellow students at the RCA, such as Ron Kitaj, R. B. Kitaj, and Peter Blake, Hockney began exploring popular culture's impact on art. As a result, he became one of the key figures of British Pop Art, a movement characterized by its critique of consumer culture, embrace of mass-produced imagery, and the challenge it posed to established artistic norms. Returning down to the painting, \\"Bertha and Bernie\\" is an oil on canvas work with dimensions measuring 60x48 inches. It showcases Hockney's signature style of portraying subjects in bright and vibrant colors. The painting features two prominent figures, presumably Bertha and Bernie, depicted in Hockney's playful and whimsical Pop Art framing. Over the years, David Hockney has experimented with numerous styles, like Realism, Abstract Expressionism, and Cubism, before developing his iconic style that harmoniously blends reality and abstraction. Although his work is highly varied, Hockney's paintings often convey the essence of two main themes: intimate moments and the relationships between individuals. As a prolific artist, David Hockney's work not only spans paintings but also drawings, printmaking, stage design, photography, and digital media. Some of his most famous works include \\"A Bigger Splash\\" (1967) and \\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\\" (1972), which was auctioned for a record-breaking 90.3 million in 2018.

That night, Snoopy has a nightmare where he is a World War I flying ace, and is shot down while fighting an aerial battle with an unshown enemy (presumably the Red Baron), and he takes over Charlie Brown's bed. When Charlie Brown stops at Lucy's psychiatric help booth, she prepares slides to show him all of his faults; the experience only leaves him more depressed. On the way to school the next day, Lucy jokingly suggests that Charlie Brown enter the school spelling bee. Linus, however, considers it a good idea and encourages him despite the jeers of Lucy, Violet, and Patty (\\"Failure Face\\").     \\"Snoopy's Harp\\" Charlie Brown nervously enters the spelling bee, and he defeats the other children in his class when he spells insecure, a word he considers his trademark.

In class the next day, Charlie Brown freezes when challenged with perceive, but he recovers when Snoopy plays the song's accompaniment outside the school. Crowned champion, the other kids cheerfully follow him home and sing (\\"Champion Charlie Brown\\"). Lucy proclaims herself his agent, and when his friends suggest that he continue studying, he is confused. They tell him that he must now take part in the National Spelling Bee in New York City, and he is again filled with self-doubt.

Is it worthwhile, in this day and age, to read The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire?","output":"While these two questions are related, they do not have the exact same meaning. Let's examine them step by step to see their differences. 1. To what extent has Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire stood the test of time? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the endurance and relevance of Gibbon's work. - Specifically, it interrogates whether the book's historical analysis, arguments, and presentation still hold up today. - It asks if the book's content remains valid and useful for understanding the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. 2. Is it worthwhile, in this day and age, to read The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? Meaning analysis: - This question focuses on the personal or educational value of reading Gibbon's work. - It asks if the book would be an appropriate or useful use of time for a modern reader. - It takes the modern perspective into account, considering if there are other, more relevant or more accessible resources available to study the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.

Review: Let me start out by saying that I love Mary Balogh's writing, but no one bats a hundred every time.The story started out well enough. However, the female protagonist turned into some sort of psychologically and emotionally suicidal neurotic ultra-feminist. It was as if she wanted to punish the guy who loved her because of society's standards.There were many moments towards the end of the book that I thought someone should smack some sense into this girl. I also couldn't understand how the two characters possibly fell in love. They hardly spoke to or spent time with one another. It was all just too weird.I've never gotten past the third chapter of a book and not finish it, but I did this time. I just couldn't torture myself any longer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jenny and I were twins, and we were always close growing up despite our very different personalities. Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. Question: Why did the twins sell the house?

A new law in Nebraska which dictates that you cannot have an abortion after 20 weeks meant Deaver had no choice but to have her baby. With her husband, Robb, the couple waited ten days until she was able to give birth to baby Elizabeth. The couple cradled and comforted their baby for 15 minutes before she died. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Heartbreaking Story of Woman Denied Abortion Under Nebraska's New Law Subtitle: Danielle Deaver Forced to Deliver Doomed Baby under Controversial Legislation In a tragic case that has reignited the debate on abortion rights in the United States, 34-year-old Danielle Deaver was denied an abortion after her waters broke at just 22 weeks, forcing her to carry her baby to full term, who ultimately survived for only 15 minutes after being born. The reason behind this heart-wrenching decision was Nebraska's new 20-week abortion ban, which left Deaver with no choice but to endure the devastating outcome. The doctors informed Danielle Deaver that her baby had no chance of survival after her amniotic sac ruptured at 22 weeks, leaving the fetus without the necessary protection and nourishing fluid to develop in the womb. In the past, medical professionals would have recommended an abortion in such cases, given the cruelty of making the mother and child suffer through an event that would ultimately culminate in the heartache of death. However, Nebraska's recent law change meant that Deaver's hands were tied, and she could not terminate her pregnancy after the 20-week mark. With the support of her husband Robb, Deaver spent the next ten agonizing days waiting to deliver her child, knowing that there was no hope of survival. In an interview, Robb commented about how they knew their baby would not live, and they tried preparing themselves for the moment that would come. The couple's worst fears were realized when Danielle gave birth to their baby girl, Elizabeth, who survived for a brief 15 minutes cuddled in her parents' arms before passing away. This tragic story raises several pressing questions not just about Nebraska's abortion laws but also regarding reproductive rights in the United States as a whole. The 20-week ban enacted in Nebraska, known as the \\"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\\" has been challenged by many in the medical and legal fields who believe that it is fundamentally flawed. Critics argue that the law fails to take into account exceptional circumstances, such as those experienced by the Deaver family, which result in the prolonged suffering of both mother and baby. Furthermore, opinions on when a fetus can feel pain remain divided among experts, leading some to view the time limit as arbitrary. In a country where debate rages over abortion accessibility and a woman's right to choose, Danielle Deaver's heartrending experience serves as a painful reminder of the consequences legislation can have on the lives of real people. As lawmakers continue to grapple with contentious issues surrounding reproductive rights, stories like this one put a human face on the impact that such regulations have on families and their personal journeys. One cannot help but question if rigid laws should be the final arbiter in deeply complex and individual cases such as Deaver's. What remains certain, however, is that the ripples from this tragic case will continue to be felt in the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights and the ethical considerations of abortion laws in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Odontoglossum, first named in 1816 by Karl Sigismund Kunth, is a genus of about 100 orchids. The scientific name is derived from the Greek words \\"odon\\" (tooth) and \\"glossa\\" (tongue), referring to the two tooth-like calluses on the base of the lip. This genus of cool to cold growing orchids is to be found on open spots in the humid cloud forest at higher elevations from Central- and West South America to Guyana, with most species around the northern Andes. The abbreviation for this genus is Odm. in the horticultural trade.  - Miltonia, abbreviated Milt. in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus formed by nine epiphyte species and eight natural hybrids inhabitants of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one species reaching the northeast of Argentina and east of Paraguay. This genus was established by John Lindley in 1837, when he described its type species, \\"Miltonia spectabilis\\". Many species were attributed to \\"Miltonia\\" in the past, however, today, the species from Central America and from cooler areas on northwest of South America have been moved to other genera. \\"Miltonia\\" species have large and long lasting flowers, often in multifloral inflorescences. This fact, allied to being species that are easy to grow and to identify, make them a favorite of orchid collectors all over the world. Species of this genus are extensively used to produce artificial hybrids.  - The Oncidiinae is a subtribe within the Orchidaceae that consists of a number of genera that are closely related.   - The West Indies or Caribbean Basin is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean in the Caribbean, that includes the island nations and surrounding waters of three major archipelagoes: the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. The term is synonymous with the term \\"Caribbean Basin\\". The region is known as the area running from Florida westward along the Gulf coast, then south along the Mexican coast through Central America and then eastward across the northern coast of South America. Bermuda is also included within the region even though it is in the west-central Atlantic, due to its common cultural history created by European colonization of the region, and in most of the region by the presence of a significant group of African descent.  - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León.  - Oncidium, abbreviated as Onc. in the horticultural trade, is a genus that contains about 330 species of orchids from the subtribe Oncidiinae of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). As presently conceived (May 2014), it is distributed across much of South America, Central America, Mexico and the West Indies, with one species \\"(O. ensatum)\\" extending into Florida. Common names for plants in this genus include dancing-lady orchid and golden shower orchid. In 2008, Oxfords Annals of Botany labeled the \\"Oncidium\\" alliance \\"grossly polyphyletic.\\" The American Orchid Society labeled this genus a \\"dumping ground.\\" After DNA testing and much debate, a consensus was announced (April 2013) resulting in major taxonomic changes to \\"Oncidium, Gomesa, Odontoglossum, Miltonia,\\" and others. Much of this debate and subsequent housekeeping was initiated by significant research for the scientific publication Genera Orchidacearum Volume 5. As a result, much of the information in this article is now deprecated, but still of great value. One significant change is the move of most Brazilian \\"Oncidium\\" with a fused lateral sepal to the genus \\"Gomesa\\". The Royal Horticultural Society system, the World Checklist of Monocots database at http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/home.do and the American Orchid Society have already updated their databases to reflect most of these changes.  Description. This genus was first described by Olof Swartz in 1800 with the orchid \\"Oncidium altissimum\\", which has become the type species. Its name is derived from the Greek word , \\"onkos\\", meaning \\"swelling\\". This refers to the callus at the lower lip.  - Florida (Spanish for \\"land of flowers\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered to the west by the Gulf of Mexico, to the north by Alabama and Georgia, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the south by the Straits of Florida and Cuba. Florida is the 22nd most extensive, the 3rd most populous, and the 8th most densely populated of the U.S. states. Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital.  - Annals of Botany is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal, founded in 1887, that publishes research articles, brief communications, and reviews in all areas of botany. The journal is supported and managed by Annals of Botany Company, a non-profit educational charity, and published through Oxford University Press. According to the 2011 \\"Journal Citation Reports\\" it has an impact factor of 4.030, in 2009 ranking 18th out of 172 in the category Plant Sciences.  - Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760  September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781.  He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists. In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens. His botanical collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium. By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805.  - The American Orchid Society is a horticultural society devoted to education, conservation, and research of orchids (plant family Orchidaceae). The organization was founded in 1921, and now has a worldwide membership.

Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others. Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the filmâthe idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes. After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it. The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared. When some of the men suggest that he simply bury the bodies quickly the man informs them that emigration means that only old people are left in the town and when their children learn of their deaths they beg him not to bury the bodies immediately so that they may come back and...

Please answer the following question: Dear Mr. Wolfson, The purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated   community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator  . I have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition. Just last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble   person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it. I thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor   an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event! I urge you to correct that omission   now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community.

But today, a story with longer-term consequences takes center stage: U.S. relations with China. In the Oval Office at 10:00 am ET and 11:00 am, President Obama holds bilateral meetings with Chinese President Hu for the Chinese leader’s official state visit. At 12:20 pm, Obama and Hu meet with prominent U.S. and Chinese business leaders. Less than an hour later, at 1:05 pm, Obama and Hu hold a joint news conference. And in the evening, the state dinner honoring Hu gets underway.      *** Little leverage: NBC’s Andrea Mitchell notes that the U.S. has very little leverage in today’s talks with Hu. In recent months, the United States has been borrowing 4 billion a day to finance the budget deficit -- HALF of which is now provided every day by China. At the same time, China has to worry about its own inflation problems, U.S. officials tell Mitchell. And as the holder of all that debt, the last thing China wants is for the U.S. economy to fall back into recession, or worse. A major concern here is that Hu has diminished authority -- unlike past Chinese leaders -- and that the real power lies with the military. Our take on today’s state visit: It has become another foreign-policy event that Obama has tried to turn into an economic story (just consider today’s CEO meet-and-greet at 12:20 pm). In fact, the economic part is more important than the strategic part. Many Americans may be watching today's events asking: is China an ally or an adversary or both? Our answer: exactly. It's a complicated relationship where there's still a lot of cultural distrust that needs to be overcome.      *** Stepping on the repeal story: It’s also worth pointing out how today’s state visit has stepped on the health-repeal story. Last week, and especially before Arizona, the GOP effort to repeal Obama’s signature health-care law would have been the dominating political story. Now? It’s not being watched as closely -- due to Arizona, the China story, and also the fact that repeal is unlikely going anywhere in the Senate. The Washington Post also makes this point: The House’s current debate over health care is much more civil than it was a year ago. “This time around, there were no frightening warnings about ‘death panels’ for the elderly or a ‘holocaust’ of uninsured Americans.” The final vote on the repeal effort is expected around 5:00 pm to 5:30 pm ET, NBC's Luke Russert says, and the measure is certain to pass given the GOP’s majority. http://wapo.st/gdMcz6      *** NBC/WSJ poll day! How do Americans view China (vs. the U.S.)? What are their thoughts on the health law and the GOP effort to repeal it? And how do they see President Obama after the Arizona shootings and Congress’ lame-duck achievements? Well, look for the answers in our latest NBC/WSJ poll, which comes out at 6:30 pm ET.      *** Why Manitowoc? Yesterday, the White House announced that Obama would travel to Manitowoc, WI the day after his State of the Union address. Why Manitowoc? Consider that Obama captured 53% of the vote in this county in the 2008 general election. But last year, victorious Republicans Scott Walker (in the governor’s race) and Ron Johnson (in the Senate contest) won, respectively, 60% and 58% in Manitowoc. This isn't that friendly of a county for the president; it's arguably GOP leaning since Obama's percentage in the county in 2008 underperformed his percentage in the state (56%) by three points.      *** End of a Senate era: The most striking part about the news yesterday that both Sens. Joe Lieberman (I) and Kent Conrad (D) would be retiring at the end of this Congress wasn't the politics, though we'll dig into that in a minute. Instead, especially for those of us who started covering politics in the '90s, it was yet another reminder that a Senate era is ending. Consider this list of senators who have retired, lost, or died since 2008: Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Ted Stevens, Arlen Specter, John Warner, Chris Dodd, Kit Bond, even Joe Biden. And when you add Lieberman and Conrad to that list, that's a combined 335 years of Senate service.      *** Lieberman’s tough re-election path: As for the politics of Lieberman’s retirement -- which he’ll announce at 12:30 pm ET in Stamford, CT -- his path to victory would have been extremely difficult. He could have run for re-election as a Democrat, but would have faced a primary challenge from the left, and we saw how that played out in 2006 (with Ned Lamont defeating him). He could have, as he did after his primary loss, run as an independent. But remember that Lieberman was able to pull off that victory because the GOP nominee (Alan Schlesinger) got just 10% of the vote. “He believes that if he were to run for re-election it’d be a tough fight,” aide Marshall Wittmann told the New York Times. “He’s confident he could’ve won that fight.” Yet this is also perhaps a fitting time for Lieberman to announce the end of his Senate career. After disappointing his party -- on Iraq, for endorsing John McCain, for criticizing Obama at the GOP convention -- the Connecticut senator stewarded the passage of a top Democratic priority: repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”      *** Here’s a conversation starter: The last three unsuccessful VP nominees have been Sarah Palin. John Edwards, and Joe Lieberman. Discuss. (Hat tip: Walter Shapiro.)      *** A tale of two retirements: Speaking of retirements… Last week, Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R) announced she was retiring. The actual impact on 2012: Unless something shocking happens, a Republican (possibly Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst) will hold on to the seat, especially in a presidential year. But when North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad (D) said yesterday that he wasn’t running for re-election in 2012, that has a MUCH bigger impact. The reason: It’s unclear if Democrats will be able win this open seat, especially in a state where Obama won just 45% of the vote in ’08. Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg Political Reports says that the GOP starts out with the early advantage. “Republicans have to be considered the favorites to take over the seat,” he said. The good news for Democrats -- the GOP no longer has a John Hoeven waiting in the wings. While Lieberman, Conrad, and KBH are retiring, one longtime senator isn’t: Dick Lugar (R), who might have to fend off a Tea Party primary challenge. http://wapo.st/i7JjpC      *** Harry Reid’s new challenge: Here’s one final point about Lieberman’s retirement: Since he’s not running for re-election, this means he’s a total free agent on legislative matters. A new challenge for Harry Reid?      *** Boehner’s absence: As we mentioned above, Obama tonight is holding a state dinner with President Hu of China tonight. But guess who’s not coming to the Hu dinner: newly installed House Speaker John Boehner. The move has raised eyebrows for some, especially after Boehner turned down a ride on Air Force One to go to Tucson, and after Republican congressional leaders wanted a later date for their post-election meeting with Obama. In fairness, Boehner will meet with Hu to have a substantive meeting this week on Capitol Hill, according to Boehner aide Michael Steel. On turning down the ride on Air Force One, Boehner was tending to duties as speaker -- a bipartisan prayer service, for example -- that kept him from jumping on that flight. And it's also true that Boehner rarely, if ever, attends state dinners. But the question becomes whether the speaker, who’s second in line in presidential succession, has a greater responsibility to appear at these kind of events. NBC's Mitchell notes that Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker during the second Clinton term, was very present at the state dinner for Ziang Zemin -- the last state visit for a Chinese leader.      *** Trumka on 2012: AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is addressing the National Press Club this morning. Here’s an excerpt of Trumka’s remarks: “Last year’s election was fundamentally about jobs, and I believe the 2012 election will be fundamentally about jobs. America wants to work. People who live in Wonderland may not have noticed, but there is a lot of work to be done here. While one in five construction workers is looking for work, we have a 2.2 trillion old-school infrastructure deficit. We need to invest trillions more to build the 21st century infrastructure necessary for our nation’s and our planet’s future—high-speed mass transit, smart utilities and universal high-speed broadband.”      Countdown Chicago’s mayoral election: 34 days      Countdown to Election Day 2011: 293 days      Countdown to the Iowa caucuses: 383 days      * Note: When the IA caucuses take place depends on whether other states move up      Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are taking a pass on the black-tie event at the White House. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, a critic of China’s human-rights policy, plans to go to the state dinner, the first for a Chinese leader in more than 13 years.      All three no-shows, through their aides, cited scheduling conflicts. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who has called the Chinese president “a dictator,” are to meet Hu at the Capitol tomorrow.      “I look forward to the meeting,” Boehner told reporters today.      If Hu or Obama had concerns about the leaders’ decisions to stay away, neither would say. At a news conference, Hu deferred a question on the matter to Obama, saying the president was “in a better position to answer.” Obama never did.      Lawmakers in both political parties have been making hostile statements and proposing tough economic measures against China, including legislation to let the U.S. government impose duties on the nation for undervaluing its currency.      Scoring With Voters      Political messages critical of China scored high with voters during last year’s congressional campaign, said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who researched the issue while advising candidates.      “There’s no question that the American public looks at China as very much a serious competitor -- it’s not quite an enemy, but it’s a competitor -- and Americans are very wary of China these days,” he said.      Mellman, who has advised Reid, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and numerous House members, said virtually every candidate he worked with last year touched on the issue in some way.      Hu’s visit is focused on economic ties between the two countries, including more than 400 billion in annual trade, as well as differences over human rights, China’s enforcement of intellectual-property rights and what U.S. officials say is the artificially low value of the yuan.      Higher Import Duties      Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine told Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in a letter this week that they will try to revive House-passed legislation to let U.S. businesses seek higher duties on some Chinese imports to offset any advantage from an undervalued currency. The bill died in the Senate last year.      At the same time, lawmakers preparing to receive Hu at the Capitol tomorrow are making it clear that the Chinese president is no friend.      “He is a dictator,” Reid told a Las Vegas television station yesterday. “He can do a lot of things through the form of government they have. Maybe I shouldn’t have said ‘dictator,’ but they have a different type of government than we have, and that is an understatement.”      Republicans and Democrats hammered at China during a briefing by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today.      Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, a longtime critic of China’s human-rights record, called Hu an “oppressor” and a “murderer,” questioning why Obama was giving a respectful welcome to “a monstrous regime.”      ‘World Domination’      Democratic Representative Albio Sires of New Jersey said China was seeking “world domination.” New Jersey Republican Representative Chris Smith suggested that Hu should be brought before an international criminal tribunal instead of feted at the White House.      The remarks were in contrast to the scene today at the executive mansion, where Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Hu with an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn.      Obama said the U.S. and China “have an enormous stake in each other’s success.” Hu said, “Our cooperation as partners should be based on mutual respect.”      Lawmakers’ slights of Hu may add to distrust between the two nations, said Dan Mahaffee, an expert on China at the Washington-based Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress.      “It sends an unfortunate message that at a time of competition between the two countries, that American politicians are busy looking inward,” Mahaffee said, adding that lawmakers are playing to public fears.      Pew Survey      A January survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 53 percent of Americans said it was important for the U.S. to get tougher with China on trade and economic issues. One in five, or 20 percent, said China posed the greatest threat to the U.S. of any country, up from 11 percent in November 2009.      “Local pressure at the district translates up,” Mahaffee said.      Dozens of congressional candidates aired television advertisements last year seizing on the theme. In one, Reid called his Tea Party-supported Republican opponent Sharron Angle “a foreign worker’s best friend,” and said she backed tax breaks for “outsourcing to China and India.”      Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California made similar charges against her Republican rival, former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina, saying she shipped jobs “to Shanghai instead of San Jose.”      Chinese Wind Turbines      Republicans hit on the theme too. In a spot set to Chinese- sounding music, candidate Spike Maynard slammed Democratic Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia for backing Obama’s economic-stimulus law, saying it helped fund projects powered by Chinese-made wind turbines.      “Only a politician who’s been in Washington 34 years would vote to help foreign companies create Chinese jobs making windmills,” said the advertisement, which featured pictures of Mao Zedong, the communist revolutionary who ruled the People’s Republic of China from its founding in 1949 to his death in 1976.      Reid and Boxer won re-election; Maynard lost.      The potency of China as a campaign theme was clear, said Clayton Dube, who leads the University of Southern California’s U.S.-China Institute in Los Angeles.      “Part of it is a genuine worry that the United States is being victimized by an all-powerful Chinese government,” Dube said. “The notion that things are not fair is a very powerful one. It resonates with Americans all the time, particularly in hard times.”      To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Hirschfeld Davis in Washington at jdavis159@bloomberg.net; Lisa Lerer in Washington at llerer@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Silva at msilva34@bloomberg.net ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The article talks about a special meeting between the leaders of the United States and China.

Even though his weekend leave is withdrawn he still goes to town and ends up going to a hotel room with two girls and fellow soldier Paxton (Matthew Davis). Bozz and Paxton make friends despite their different outlooks; Paxton has enlisted for service and wants to go to Nam for the experience.At the base, while Bozz shows that he is capable of being a good soldier when he wants to, he continues to attract disciplinary penalties as well as the anger of fellow privates, especially one named Wilson (Shea Whigham). The higher ranked personnel are abusive, especially Sergeant Thomas (James MacDonald), who one night knocks young Private Cantwell (Tom Guiry) to pieces. When Bozz learns that Cantwell is married and a father to four children he helps Cantwell get out of military duty.

Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What is probably true about the author?

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: how about you guys are you in a house apartment or a house Sentence 2: Do you live in a single family home or in an apartment? If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Options: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","output":"To analyze the statements and answer the question, let's break down the information provided in each sentence. Sentence 1: How about you guys, are you in a house apartment or a house? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house. Sentence 2: Do you live in a single-family home or in an apartment? - This sentence asks if the person(s) in question live in a single-family home (which is essentially a house) or an apartment. Now, let's consider the question and the options: Question: If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? The first sentence being true means that the person(s) in question live in a house, an apartment, or a house.  Now, let's examine the possibilities for each option: Option 1: Yes - If the person(s) live in a house or an apartment, this would mean the second sentence asking \\"Do you live in a single-family home or an apartment?\\" could also be true since a house can be considered a single-family home.   Option 2: It is not possible to tell - At first glance, this option may seem plausible since the first sentence asks about living in a \\"house apartment,\\" a term that is not widely used. However, since it also asks about living in a house, we can still conclude that the second sentence could be true. Option 3: No - This option indicates that the second sentence would not be true if the first sentence is true. However, since both sentences essentially ask about living in a house or an apartment, it makes sense that if the first statement holds true, the second should as well. Based on the comparison of the sentences and the options, the most accurate answer to the question, \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" would be: Option 1: Yes"},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - Worsted (or ) is a high-quality type of wool yarn, the fabric made from this yarn, and a yarn weight category. The name derives from Worstead, a village in the English county of Norfolk. That village, together with North Walsham and Aylsham, formed a manufacturing centre for yarn and cloth in the 12th century, when pasture enclosure and liming rendered the East Anglian soil too rich for the older agrarian sheep breeds. In the same period, many weavers from Flanders moved to Norfolk. \\"Worsted\\" yarns/fabrics are distinct from woollens (though both are made from sheep's wool): the former is considered stronger, finer, smoother, and harder than the latter.  - Aylsham is a historic market town and civil parish on the River Bure in north Norfolk, England, about north of Norwich. The river rises near Melton Constable, upstream from Aylsham and continues to Great Yarmouth and the North Sea, although it was only made navigable after 1779, allowing grain, coal and timber to be brought up river.  - Gautam Hari Singhania (born 9 September 1965) is an Indian Industrialist.

The latter, disparaged as \\"Mr Nyet\\" in the West, had served for 28 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Gromyko was relegated to the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (officially Soviet Head of State), as he was considered an \\"old thinker.\\" Also on July 1, Gorbachev took the opportunity to dispose of his main rival by removing Grigory Romanov from the Politburo, and brought Boris Yeltsin and Lev Zaikov into the CPSU Central Committee Secretariat. What is the answer to this question: Who was responsible for Shevardnadze's membership?","output":"The person responsible for Shevardnadze's membership in the Politburo was Gorbachev.

Article: He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. \\"He should be punished for the killings,\\" an Israeli official said, \\"He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups.\\" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: \\"They can kill me, but never get me out of my country.\\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards  _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel.  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell. Question: According to the passage, which statement is true? Options: A: In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa. B: Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel. C: China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat. D: Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people.

Here is one sentence: He walked to the front of the stage. Here is another sentence: He led the national liberation front. Does the term front mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the context and meaning of the word \\"front\\" in the first sentence. In the first sentence, \\"He walked to the front of the stage,\\" the word \\"front\\" refers to the area or position that is in the forwardmost part of the stage. It indicates a spatial location primarily associated with facing the audience. Step 2: Analyze the context and meaning of the word \\"front\\" in the second sentence. In the second sentence, \\"He led the national liberation front,\\" the word \\"front\\" refers to a political or military group, typically united under a common goal or ideology. Here, it indicates a unified organization that is working toward the goal of national liberation. Step 3: Compare the meanings of \\"front\\" in both sentences. After analyzing the meanings of \\"front\\" in both sentences, it becomes apparent that the term \\"front\\" does not mean the same thing in both sentences.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The city was gray but the buildings contrasted with dirt red. The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking. Stopping at benches, I would rest until I could muster more energy. Question: Why was the air cool and prepped with moisture? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The air was cool and peppered with moisture because the protagonist was close to the ocean. Coastal regions often experience cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels due to the presence of large bodies of water. This is because water has a high heat capacity, allowing it to absorb and release heat slowly, which results in a moderating effect on temperature. Additionally, the evaporation of water from the ocean adds moisture to the air, creating a damp and cool atmosphere. As the protagonist noted their proximity to the ocean, it is evident that these coastal factors contributed to the cool and moist air they experienced in Boston."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
