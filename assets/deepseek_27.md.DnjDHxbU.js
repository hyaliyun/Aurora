Options: - texas - guest room - horseradish - living room - basement Answer:","output":"Based on the given question and options provided, the most suitable option to complete the sentence in line with common sense would be \\"horseradish.\\" The question describes a scenario where someone is eating a roast beef sandwich on his sofa bed and accidentally spills a spicy sauce on it. The logical answer should be a type of sauce in this case. So, the complete answer would be: He was eating a roast beef sandwich on his sofa bed and spilled horseradish sauce on it. Let's briefly evaluate the other options to clarify why they are not appropriate in this context: 1. Texas - This option is a U.S. state and not a spicy sauce, which makes it an incorrect choice to complete the sentence. 2. Guest room - This option is a type of room in a house, not a spicy sauce. It is irrelevant to the situation described in the question. 3. Living room - Similar to the \\"guest room\\" option, the living room is another house area and not a spicy sauce. 4. Basement - This option represents another part of a house or building, and it does not correspond to a spicy sauce. In conclusion, the most appropriate choice in line with common sense is \\"horseradish,\\" as it refers to a spicy sauce that can be spilled on a roast beef sandwich, while the rest of the options are unrelated to the context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This commitment included continued financial assistance, training of Afghan security forces, and collaboration on security and counterterrorism efforts. Furthermore, the agreement opened channels for ongoing political, economic, cultural, and social cooperation between the two nations, laying the groundwork for a more stable and prosperous future for Afghanistan. The partnership demonstrated the resilience of the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan, highlighting a shared commitment to defeating terrorism and promoting peace and security in the region. In his speech, President Obama emphasized that the United States had no intention of maintaining a permanent military presence in Afghanistan. The primary focus was to strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan government, security forces, and local institutions to enable them to effectively protect and govern their own country. This approach reflected the broader U.S. strategy to transition from a military-led approach to a more sustainable civilian-led approach in Afghanistan, fostering long-term economic development, good governance, and the rule of law. The signing of the strategic partnership agreement was a crucial step in enhancing the U.S.-Afghan relationship, underpinning the long-term engagement of the United States in Afghanistan's peace, security, and development. Through strong collaboration and shared determination, both countries aimed to overcome the challenges posed by terrorism and extremism. As President Obama stated, the agreement affirmed that the United States would stand by the Afghan people, ensuring their lasting security and stability beyond the withdrawal of U.S. troops."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Open the package and set the steaks on a plate for 20 to 30 minutes, so they aren't chilly and will cook evenly. Sprinkle the steaks with salt to taste. Turn a gas grill on to medium heat. If you're using a charcoal grill, fill a chimney half to three-quarters full of briquettes and light them. Dump the hot briquettes on one half of the grate to set up a two-zone fire. Arrange the steaks on the grill over indirect heat, if you're using a charcoal grill. Close the lid and grill the steaks for 5 to 6 minutes without moving them. Open the lid of the grill and use tongs to flip the steaks over. Dip a barbecue brush into a bowl of smoky barbecue sauce or steak sauce. Spread a thin layer of the sauce over the tenderloin steaks and put the lid on the grill. Keep the lid on the grill and continue to cook the tenderloin steaks. Use the lower cooking times for a medium-rare steak. If you want the tenderloin steaks cooked rare, grill them for a minute less than recommended. Open the lid and turn the tenderloin steaks over. Dip the brush in more sauce and spread another thin layer over the steaks. Put the lid on and grill the steaks until they've charred just a little bit. This should take 2 minutes. Remove the lid from the grill and use tongs to transfer the steaks to a plate. Sprinkle the steaks with a little ground pepper, if desired. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil over the steaks and let the steaks rest. They'll finish cooking and the juices will redistribute within the meat. If you grilled small tenderloin steaks, serve them whole or slice them into thin strips and serve them. Consider serving the meat with extra barbecue or steak sauce. You can store leftover tenderloin steaks in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.

And they may be right. A Swedish study published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention concludes that digital billboards hold the gazes of drivers longer than two seconds. Previous studies have shown that anything that takes a driver's eyes off the road for that length of time increases the risks of a crash. \\"This study proves what is common sense when it comes to digital billboards,\\" says Mary Tracy, president of Scenic America, a national nonprofit group that seeks to limit billboards. \\"Bright, constantly changing signs on the sides of roads are meant to attract and keep the attention of drivers, and this study confirms that this is exactly what they do.\\" The Federal Highway Administration allowed digital signs for the first time in 2007 after concluding they did not pose a significant danger.

Please answer the following question: Good Genes Mean Long Life Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have. For the lucky carriers of \\"Methuselah\\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  . The \\"Methuselah\\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \\"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\\" he told The Times. \\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\\" According to David Gems,   _  . A) drugs to slow ageing will be very expensive B) modern science will be able to find more longevity genes C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing D) scientists can make new genes that will allow longer life Answer:","output":"C) it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Second question: What does the present young generation feel about the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s that shook the world? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: The name commonly given to the political and social movement that swept Quebec society in the beginning of the 1960s is \\"The Quiet Revolution.\\" This revolution, which took place between 1960 and 1966, was marked by significant social, political, and cultural changes in Quebec. The primary goal of the movement was to modernize and secularize the province, which was heavily influenced by the Catholic Church. The Quiet Revolution also sought to promote self-determination and the affirmation of French-speaking Quebecers as a distinct cultural and linguistic entity within Canada. Key achievements of the Quiet Revolution include the nationalization of the hydroelectric industry, the launch of a comprehensive welfare state, educational reforms, the establishment of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and a series of labor laws to uplift the working class. The Quiet Revolution also cultivated a strong sense of nationalism and pride among Quebecers, eventually leading to a more assertive stance towards the Canadian government on matters of language, culture, and provincial autonomy. Second question: Young generations of today hold a variety of opinions on the hippie movement of the 1960s-1970s. Some admire the movement for its emphasis on peace, love, freedom, and environmental consciousness, as well as its role in pushing for social justice and progressive change, including civil rights, women's rights, and LGBTQ+ rights. The era's lasting influence on creative expression, including film, art, music, and fashion, is another factor that may appeal to younger generations. On the other hand, some young people view the hippie movement as an overly idealistic and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at societal change. They may criticize the movement's widespread experimentation with drugs, perceived lack of focus, or countercultural practices that were seen as nonconformist or rebellious at the time. For some, the movement may represent a bygone era that's hard to relate to or lacks the relevance to current social issues. These two questions are not asking the same thing. While both pertain to social and cultural movements of the same time period, the Quiet Revolution was specific to Quebec and focused on provincial modernization and the French-Canadian identity, while the hippie movement was a global phenomenon that encompassed broader social change and counterculture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the day Katniss and Peeta are set to begin a victory tour of the country, President Coriolanus Snow visits her. He explains that her approach to ending the last Hunger Games, where she and Peeta attempted a suicide pact after learning they could not both survive, inspired rebellions in the districts. He orders that Katniss not only convince the entire country of her and Peeta's love as the reason for their actions, but convince Snow himself as well; if not, her loved ones will be killed, and District 12 will be destroyed, just as District 13 was during the uprising years ago.The first stop of the tour is in District 11, former home of Rue, Katniss' 12-year-old ally who was killed in the previous games.

Q: Context_1 : Split Rock Lighthouse State Park is a state park of Minnesota on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It is best known for the picturesque Split Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States. Built by the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Minnesota Historical Society operates them as a museum. The 2200 acre state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling. Context_2 : Baldred Rock ( ) is a rock in Fitchie Bay at Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands. It lies close off the south side of Ferrier Peninsula, 0.75 nmi east-southeast of Graptolite Island. This rock was mapped by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under William Speirs Bruce, 1902–04, and was later named \\"Bass Rock\\" owing to its likeness to the Bass Rock in Scotland. The name Bass Rock has also appeared on charts as an alternative name for an island in the Joinville Island group. To avoid confusion of these names, in 1954 the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee recommended an entirely new name for the rock at Fitchie Bay. Baldred Rock is named after Saint Baldred, the first hermit known to have lived on the Scottish Bass Rock. Context_3 : Black Rock Harbor Light, also known as Fayerweather Island Light, is a lighthouse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States which stands on the south end of Fayerweather Island and marks the entrance to Black Rock Harbor. The first lighthouse at the site, built by Abisha Woodward under contract with the United States government, was a wooden tower that was lit and made operational by 1808. A storm destroyed the tower in 1821 and the current, stone lighthouse was erected in its place in 1823. The Black Rock Harbor Light was an active navigational aid until 1933 when it was replaced by two automatic lights offshore. The beacon was subsequently given to the City of Bridgeport in 1934. Two significant efforts during the 1980s and 1990s served to restore the aging tower and the light was relit as a non-navigational aid in 2000. Black Rock Lighthouse is listed as a contributing property for Bridgeport's Seaside Park historic district. Context_4 : The Bass Rock Lighthouse on Bass Rock is a 20 m lighthouse, built in 1902 by David Stevenson, who demolished the 13th-century keep, or governor's house, and some other buildings within the castle for the stone. The commissioners of the Northern Lighthouse Board decided that a lighthouse should be erected on the Bass Rock in July 1897 along with another light at Barns Ness near Dunbar. The cost of constructing the Bass Rock light was £8,087, a light first being shone from the rock on the evening of 1 November 1902. It has been unmanned since 1988 and is remotely monitored from the board’s headquarters in Edinburgh. Until the automation the lighthouse was lit by incandescent gas obtained from vaporised paraffin oil converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle. Since that time a new biform ML300 synchronised bifilament 20-watt electric lamp has been used. Context_5 : Split Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located southwest of Silver Bay, Minnesota, USA on the North Shore of Lake Superior. The structure was designed by lighthouse engineer Ralph Russell Tinkham and was completed in 1910 by the United States Lighthouse Service at a cost of 75,000, including the buildings and the land. It is considered one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States. Context_6 : New Brighton Lighthouse or Perch Rock Lighthouse, is a decommissioned lighthouse situated at the confluence of the River Mersey and Liverpool Bay on an outcrop off New Brighton known locally as Perch Rock. Together with its neighbour, the Napoleonic era Fort Perch Rock, it is one of the Wirral's best known landmarks. Context_7 : The Bass Rock, or simply the Bass ( ), is an island in the outer part of the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland. Approximately 2 km offshore, and 5 km north-east of North Berwick, it is a steep-sided volcanic rock, 107 m at its highest point, and is home to a large colony of gannets. The rock is uninhabited, but historically has been settled by an early Christian hermit, and later was the site of an important castle, which after the Commonwealth period was used as a prison. The island belongs to Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, whose family acquired it in 1706, and before to the Lauder family for almost six centuries. The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of an ancient chapel survive. Context_8 : Halfway Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse located on a barren ledge in Casco Bay, Maine. The lighthouse tower, which has a height of 76 ft , and the attached ex-boathouse are all that remain, as the other buildings have been taken away in storms. The name \\"Halfway Rock\\" comes from the position of the rock which is halfway between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Small, the southwest and northeast extremities of Casco Bay, which are about 18 nmi apart. Context_9 : Ida Lewis Lighthouse, which was formerly the Lime Rock Lighthouse, is in the Newport harbor in Rhode Island. It is named after Ida Lewis, who lived and worked at the lighthouse from 1857 and was the official lighthouse keeper from 1879 until her death in 1911. She was celebrated for many acts of bravery in saving lives. Context_10 : Canty Bay is a coastal hamlet off the A198, in East Lothian, Scotland, situated opposite the Bass Rock and Tantallon Castle. Settlements nearby include Auldhame, Scoughall, Seacliff, and the Peffer Sands. fact_1 : Canty Bay is a coastal hamlet off the A198, in East Lothian, Scotland, situated opposite the Bass Rock and Tantallon Castle. fact_2 :  The Bass Rock Lighthouse was constructed on the rock in 1902, and the remains of an ancient chapel survive.

During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of Missions in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. The most significant failure of Roman Catholic missionary work was in Ethiopia. Although its ruler, Emperor Susenyos, had publicly declared his conversion to Catholicism in 1622, the declaration of Roman Catholicism as the official religion in 1626 led to increasing civil war. Following Susenyos' abdication, his son and successor Fasilides expelled archbishop Afonso Mendes and his Jesuit brethren in 1633, then in 1665 ordered the remaining religious writings of the Catholics burnt. On the other hand, other missions  were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism. The first Catholic Church was built in Beijing in 1650. The emperor granted freedom of religion to Catholics. Ricci had modified the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among other things the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called Chinese Rites controversy in 1692 and 1742.

Ricci's approach was focused on integration and adaptation, which led him to permit certain customs, such as the veneration of the dead, in an effort to appeal to the local Chinese population and facilitate the spread of Catholicism in China. This decision, however, was later disputed and eventually forbidden by the Vatican in the Chinese Rites controversy of 1692 and 1742, as they disagreed with the adaptation of Catholic practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night.

Based on the premise \\"and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The biggest amount of fake US gold is manufactured in Lebanon.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the truth of the hypothesis \\"The biggest amount of fake US gold is manufactured in Lebanon\\", based on the given premise, let's first dissect the premise and analyze the available evidence. Premise: \\"And amazingly enough you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon.\\" The premise states that the person is interested in Middle Eastern coins, and according to them, Lebanon produces the largest amount of fake US gold. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, several factors need to be analyzed: 1. Source of information: The credibility of the given premise is crucial in determining the truth of the hypothesis. It is important to know where the information came from and whether the source can be trusted. In the absence of a reliable source, the premise alone may not be enough to establish the truth of the hypothesis. 2. Evidence supporting the claim: Are there any studies, official statistics, or reports confirming the claim that Lebanon manufactures the largest amount of counterfeit US gold in comparison to other countries? These documents would serve as concrete evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. Without evidence, any conclusion drawn could be based on speculation or anecdotal information. 3. Comparison with other countries: The hypothesis claims that Lebanon produces the most counterfeit US gold. To prove this, it is essential to compare the production of fake US gold in Lebanon with other countries, especially those known for producing counterfeit goods. 4. Techniques used in the production of counterfeit gold: Understanding the methods employed in creating counterfeit gold can provide insight into which countries may be more likely to produce large quantities. If Lebanon is found to use advanced techniques and equipment in producing fake gold, it could further support the hypothesis. 5. Enforcement of anti-counterfeiting laws: The prevalence of counterfeit production may also be influenced by how effectively a country enforces its anti-counterfeiting laws. If Lebanon has weak enforcement, it may foster an environment where counterfeit US gold production can thrive and result in a larger amount compared to other countries. 6. Distribution channels: To support the hypothesis, one would also need to look into distribution and trading channels for counterfeit US gold originating from Lebanon. If these channels are extensive and widespread, it could indicate that Lebanon is indeed a major source of counterfeit US gold. In conclusion, to determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"The biggest amount of fake US gold is manufactured in Lebanon\\" based solely on the given premise is insufficient. More information, including evidence from reliable sources, comparative data with other countries, and a comprehensive understanding of production techniques and distribution channels, is needed before reaching a conclusion that supports or refutes the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It has several common names, including: aplodontia, mountain boomer, ground bear, and giant mole. The name sewellel beaver comes from \\"sewellel\\" or \\"suwellel\\", the Chinookan term for a cloak made from its pelts. This species is the only living member of its genus, Aplodontia, and family, Aplodontiidae. It should not be confused with true North American and Eurasian beavers, to which it is not closely related.  - Rodents (from Latin \\"rodere\\", \\"to gnaw\\") are mammals of the order Rodentia, which are characterized by a single pair of continuously growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws. About 40% of all mammal species are rodents; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica. They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats, including human-made environments.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - The term Sciuromorpha has referred to numerous groups of rodents , but the only family common to all variations is the Sciuridae , the squirrels . Most definitions also include the mountain beaver . Traditionally , the term has been defined on the basis of the shape of the infraorbital canal . A sciuromorphous zygomasseteric system is characterized by attachment of the lateral masseter muscle along the side of the rostrum . Unlike hystricomorphous and myomorphous rodents , the medial masseter muscle does not pass through the infraorbital canal . Among extant rodents , only the families Sciuridae , Castoridae , Heteromyidae , and Geomyidae are truly sciuromorphous . Some authorities would exclude the Geomyidae and Heteromyidae from that list due to the attachment of the medial masseter directly behind the zygomatic arch. Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) redefined rodent suborders on the basis of a host of both morphological and molecular reasons . They defined the Sciuromorpha as including three families , Sciuridae , Aplodontiidae , and Gliridae . Of these , only the Sciuridae are truly sciuromorphous . The Aplodontiidae are protrogomorphous and the Gliridae are myomorphous . The connection between Aplodontiidae and Sciuridae has been proposed numerous times in the past . The two families have been united into a common infraorder ( Sciurida ) or superfamily ( Sciuroidea ) . It has long been suggested that dormice ( Gliridae ) are not particularly related to the Myomorpha , and their zygomasseteric structure has been termed \`\` pseudomyomorphy '' . The connection between squirrels and dormice has been almost exclusively suggested through genetic studies , and to a lesser degree via the fossil rodent Reithroparamys .  - The Eurasian beaver or European beaver (\\"Castor fiber\\") is a species of beaver which was once widespread in Eurasia. It was hunted to near-extinction for both its fur and castoreum; and by 1900, only 1200 beavers survived in eight relict populations in Europe and Asia. Reintroduced through much of its former range, it now occurs from Great Britain to China and Mongolia, although it is absent from Italy, Portugal, the southern Balkans, and the Middle East.  - A habitat is an ecological or environmental area that is inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.    What entity does 'sciuromorpha' has the relation 'parent taxon' with?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: Why do I create conversations in my head? Question 2: What IS KNOWN AS ELEMENT? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same as they address different topics. I will provide you with detailed answers for each question separately. Question 1: Why do I create conversations in my head? Creating conversations in your head is a common psychological phenomenon known as \\"inner speech\\" or \\"internal dialogue.\\" There are several reasons why people engage in this form of mental activity: 1. Problem-solving and decision-making: Internal conversations can help you think through problems, weigh pros and cons, and evaluate possible outcomes. By imagining various scenarios and how people might react, you can better prepare for real-life situations. 2. Emotional regulation: People often use inner speech as a way of processing emotions, such as experiencing frustration, anger, or sadness. Imagining conversations can help you express your emotions privately and find ways to address them constructively. 3. Cognitive rehearsal: Inner conversations often involve practicing potential interactions with others. This mental rehearsal can help to improve communication skills and increase self-confidence in social situations, especially if you anticipate challenging discussions or confrontations. 4. Self-reflection: Internal dialogue allows you to explore your own thoughts and feelings, as well as evaluate your actions and behaviors. This helps you to better understand yourself and inform your choices, promoting personal growth and self-awareness. 5. Creativity and imagination: Creating mental conversations stimulates the imagination, which can be a source of creative inspiration. This can be particularly helpful for artists, writers, and people seeking innovative solutions to problems. In summary, creating conversations in your head can serve essential cognitive, emotional, and social functions, helping you cope with various challenges in your life and making you more adaptable and resilient. Question 2: What is known as an element? In chemistry, an element is a substance that consists of only one type of atom. Atoms are the smallest building blocks of matter and are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Each element has its own unique properties, which determine how it interacts with other elements to form compounds. There are 118 known elements, of which 94 occur naturally on Earth. Elements are organized in the periodic table, which groups them based on their atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.  Elements can be grouped into categories such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, based on their shared properties. Here are some examples of elements: 1. Hydrogen (H) - The lightest and most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen forms water (H2O) when combined with oxygen. 2. Carbon (C) - An essential component of life on Earth, carbon is the backbone of organic molecules and can form an extraordinary range of chemical bonds. 3. Gold (Au) - A precious metal known for its unique properties such as conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and malleability, gold has been used for coins, jewelry, and electronic components. 4. Oxygen (O) - A vital element for life, oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration and makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere. 5. Silicon (Si) - The second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, silicon is a key component in semiconductors, which are crucial for modern electronics. In summary, an element is a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, and each element has its unique physical and chemical properties. The periodic table organizes these elements, helping scientists understand their relationships and how they interact to form compounds."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The tent, which had been erected amidst the rugged wilderness, served as a temporary storage and shelter for the traders’ goods. The man, whose name was Thomas, had stumbled upon this location purely by chance. He was an adventurer and had been traveling for weeks through the uncharted territories. Despite being weary and famished, he never veered away from his insatiable thirst for exploration and discovery. Today, discovering the tent filled with supplies felt like a small victory in itself. As Thomas deftly sliced through the leather of the tent, his eyes widened in surprise at the variety and amount of goods ensconced within its confines. The four large boxes were not just labeled with the names Hayworth Trading Company, Elysian Trading, Sterling & Co, and Narthex Imports, but were also overflowing with valuables and necessities. He couldn't help but wonder how these boxes had ended up here, in the middle of nowhere, and what had happened to the traders. Upon opening the boxes, Thomas discovered that the Hayworth Trading Company's box contained a mix of textiles, ornately embroidered fabrics, and rare animal hides. The Elysian Trading box was filled with a plethora of exotic spices and herbs. Intrigued by the seemingly endless supply of foreign goods, Thomas carefully and meticulously examined each item, making sure he didn't miss any hidden treasure. Sterling & Co.'s box revealed a variety of metal tools, intricately designed and of the highest quality. It was evident that the craftsmen who had forged these implements were exceptionally skilled, and Thomas knew that these tools could prove to be invaluable during his journey. The Narthex Imports box was laden with preserved foods in sealed tin containers, much to Thomas' delight. His appetite had been gnawing at him for some time, and he couldn't wait to indulge in a much-needed feast. Not finding any wine bottles or skins in the boxes was disappointing, but it barely dampened Thomas' spirits. He reasoned that there must have been another box with the alcohol, perhaps one that had been hidden away or had not been delivered yet. Nevertheless, he felt incredibly fortunate to have uncovered these supplies, and he knew that they would considerably aid him in the days to come. With an undeniable sense of satisfaction, Thomas began to strategize how best to utilize the newfound supplies as well as how to transport them along his journey. He pondered whether to use the fabrics for clothing or shelter, and how to ration the preserved food to ensure that it lasted as long as possible. The thought of bartering some of the goods with other travelers crossed his mind, allowing him even more resources and perhaps some much-coveted wine as well. As the day turned into evening, Thomas sat beside the tent, still filled with excitement about his discovery. The ingenuity and resourcefulness of trading companies and their ability to reach such remote areas inspired him, and he vowed to continue his journey with renewed determination. Regardless of the absence of wine bottles or skins, today had undoubtedly been a good day for Thomas, one that would remain etched in his memory for years to come."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The tweet reads: \\"trying to figure out why I can't follow 'JaegerM' on twitter - but he can follow me .... ?

Let's examine each sentiment element further. 1. Curiosity: The user begins their tweet by stating that they are \\"trying to figure out\\" a situation. This suggests they are attempting to understand an issue they are facing on Twitter, specifically about not being able to follow a particular user. The user is seeking information or an explanation for the problem they've encountered, which indicates a degree of curiosity. 2. Confusion: The core issue that the user highlights in their tweet is that they cannot follow a specific user and are unsure why this is happening. This uncertainty is reiterated by the use of both a double period and ellipsis (....?), showing the user's confusion regarding the situation. In addition, the fact that the user in question does not appear in the search results further contributes to the sentiment of confusion, as the reasons behind such disparities in the interaction between the two accounts remain unclear. 3. Frustration: Though frustration is not the prevailing sentiment in the tweet, it can be inferred from the user's tone. The user questions why they are not able to follow another account while the other user can follow them. This discrepancy might create a feeling of annoyance or irritation, as the user is unable to access and engage with the content they are interested in. Moreover, the inability to find the user in the search results may intensify the sense of frustration as it appears to be an unexplained issue regarding the platform's functionality. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be characterized as a blend of curiosity, confusion, and a touch of frustration. The user is trying to understand and resolve an issue they are facing on Twitter, but the lack of clear answers or explanations for the situation causes a sense of perplexity and mild annoyance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: As Apple prepares to unveil both a new high-end and low-end iPhone next week, leaked ads from a telecom provider suggest the phones may launch in China as soon as this month. The WSJ's Deborah Kan speaks with Paul Mozur about Apple's new strategy in the country.      As Apple Inc. prepares to unveil both a new high-end iPhone and a cheaper version for the first time next week, it is already working on something bigger.      The electronics giant has begun evaluating a plan to offer iPhones with screens ranging from 4.8 inches to as high as 6 inches, people familiar with the matter say. That would be a sizable leap from the 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5 released last year, and, at the upper end, would be one of the largest on the market.      Such plans signal further that the Cupertino, Calif., company is shifting its smartphone strategy as it searches for new engines of growth, and as competition with Samsung Electronics Co. intensifies .      The Korean rival has taken a commanding lead in smartphone market share in part by offering an array of devices at different prices and sizes. On Wednesday, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 3 with a screen measuring 5.7 inches, a size that places the device in a category of hybrid phone-tablets.      It is unclear whether Apple will ultimately choose to follow a multi-size, multi-device strategy beyond shipping a new lower-cost model for the first time later this month. The company often tests different devices and configurations before choosing a course.      But people familiar with the company's internal deliberations and plans indicate it appears more willing to move ahead than in years past. Component suppliers say Apple already began testing larger screens for iPhones in recent months. Apple has been particularly interested in recent tests for a 4.8-inch screen, these people say.      The screen sizes of the two iPhones that Apple is unveiling next Tuesday aren't expected to change, people familiar with the matter have said.      An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.      A multi-size strategy would echo Apple's approach to the iPod, as that once-groundbreaking product line matured. Broadening iPhone offerings would also allow Apple to address a threat from Samsung: growth outside the U.S., where Samsung and rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd. are still expanding. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in April the company sees a \\"significant opportunity in China\\" with an unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers there. Increasing sales in the country could also help Apple reverse stalled revenue growth and contracting profits, analysts say.      Samsung and other competitors have released numerous products in different sizes and prices in order to cater to a broad swath of customers, particularly in India and China. Apple will for the first time begin shipping two new smartphone products this month, people familiar with the matter say; Samsung alone has released more than half a dozen around the globe so far this year.      Apple has waged a public-relations campaign against Google Inc.'s Android software, which powers most Samsung smartphones. In March, just before Samsung's newest \\"Galaxy\\" device was unveiled in New York City, Phil Schiller, Apple's head of world-wide marketing, said the services and hardware on Android handsets \\"don't work seamlessly together.\\" Apple has also filed patent lawsuits around the world against Samsung and other rivals.      Last year, Apple released its iPhone 5 with a larger screen, but analysts say changing the size hasn't been enough. Price, too, has caused the iPhone to lag competitors. Apple's newest iPhone starts at 650 without a subsidy; Samsung offers a range of smartphones priced at below 100 in places like China, India and Indonesia. As a result, despite rising unit sales for each of the top smartphone companies, Apple's share of world-wide sales fell to 14% in the second quarter from 19% the same time a year prior. Over the same period, Samsung's share rose to 32% from 30%, according to market research firm Gartner.      Samsung's strategy underscores a competitive advantage: The South Korean company is able to bring products to the market more quickly than Apple because it controls the entire manufacturing process for its smartphones. Samsung makes everything from chips to screens at its own factories, allowing it to change designs and pump out new products at a rapid pace. By comparison, Apple relies on many suppliers to make parts for its devices and companies such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Pegatron Corp. in Taiwan to assemble them, requiring timely coordination between all the companies.      Apple has some precedent in offering a wider lineup. About three years after it unveiled the first iPod in 2001, Apple launched the iPod Mini, a physically smaller device capable of holding fewer songs. The device was a hit, despite a plethora of competing devices on the market at a lower price, and it attracted many new customers to Apple's offerings. The even smaller iPod Shuffle a year afterward also caught on. Today, Apple maintains four different product lines of iPods and a healthy command of the music device market.      The company also for the first time released a smaller version of its iPad, with a 7.9-inch screen, late last year. The standard version of the iPad made its debut at 9.7 inches in 2010. Apple has also been testing larger screen sizes for the iPad, people familiar with the matter have said.      Since the debut of the iPhone in 2007, however, Apple executives have debated and tabled plans to offer iPhones in either lower-cost models or in different sizes, according to a person familiar with those discussions. Among the challenges it saw for a lower-cost option was that the company's designers couldn't find a way to make a device that didn't look cheap or look like a close copy of the higher-end iPhone, according to that person.      Apple's business model has also been to produce fewer products, at what it argues is a higher quality. Steve Jobs, the company's co-founder who died in 2011, espoused this view often. \\"That's been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity,\\" he once said in a BusinessWeek interview. Later, he said he says \\"no\\" to 1,000 things Apple could do \\"to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much.\\"      Apple has until now chosen to release a single new iPhone model each year, and a new case design every two years, in part to keep control of production costs associated with developing, testing and creating tools to manufacture new designs with the exacting quality the company is known for, a person familiar with the matter said.      In recent months, Apple has said customers in emerging markets appear to like its cheapest smartphone, the iPhone 4, and has initiated trade-in programs in countries such as India to encourage buying. Mr. Cook said sales there grew more than 400% in the company's third quarter, ended in June. A person familiar with Apple's production also said the iPhone 4S is among the top products Apple continues to sell.      People familiar with the matter say Apple's low-cost iPhone will begin shipping alongside the new premium model smartphone and it will be offered in multiple colors. The higher-end device, meanwhile, will include a new feature, a fingerprint sensor, people familiar with the matter said.      A version of this article appeared September 6, 2013, on page B1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: 6-Inch iPhone Screen? Apple Tests Bigger Sizes. ||||| With the new iPhone likely to retain the screen size of the current one, Apple Apple finds itself missing out on the fastest growing mobile-device category in the world: The hideously named but increasingly popular market for “phablets.” These 5-to-7-inch phone-tablet hybrids nearly outsold tablets and laptops combined in the last quarter and Apple got exactly zero of those sales. Though the company pioneered the touchscreen smartphone 6 years ago with a then massive 3.5-inch display, the iPhone these days looks tiny compared to the competition. And despite Apple’s reasonable arguments on the merits of maintaining a small screen for one-handed use, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is testing prototypes as large as 6 inches, perhaps prepping its own phablet for 2014.      The odd thing about the company’s stubbornness on iPhone screen sizes is that it has never expended much effort insisting users should take its products in one size only and accept it. While the iPod was introduced as a single model, over time it spawned many variants from the smaller Shuffle, Nano and Mini to the larger iPod Touch, which ended up becoming the most popular model. You can still buy Apple’s music player in multiple form factors, depending on your preferences, rather than being told, “music is only to be enjoyed on a player of this particular size.”      In laptops, the company is arguably even more flexible. Not only does it offer three screen sizes — 11, 13 and 15 inches — but it also lets you choose from different models in the largest two of those. You want a 13-inch screen but the svelte Macbook Air? Fine. Need some more power but not a bigger screen? The 13-inch Macbook Pro is available for you. Like the 15-inch Pro model, you can choose whether or not you want the extra resolution of the Retina screen or the lower price of a standard one.      The move to offer a second size of iPhone, though, would most closely mirror the decision to offer the iPad Mini, which comes with a 7.9-inch screen after the late Steve Jobs famously bashed 7-inch tablets. CEO Tim Cook explained that the Mini isn’t a 7-incher, which is technically true but also is evidence that Apple can change its mind and explain why it isn’t doing that at the same time. The company’s reluctance to offer a larger iPhone has centered on two problems, one physical, one technical.      The physical problem is that once you increase the size of the phone from the current iPhone 5, the number of people that can reasonably operate the phone one-handed will shrink a great deal. Already, the decision to increase the screen height last year over the iPhone 4S made it difficult for a lot of people to go from corner to corner with a thumb. Like many iPhone users, I find this capability useful, but only to a point. It’s great when you just grab the phone and can do some things one handed. But typing accuracy plummets that way as does general touchscreen usage and it’s not clear that the loss of everything else a small screen keeps you from is worth it.      This problem needs a resolution      The technical problem, however, is trickier. Unlike on Android, where there are more than a dozen screen resolutions, Apple has basically two right now with the shorter and taller Retina displays. You either get 960 x 640 in the iPhone 4 and 4S or 1136 x 640 in the iPhone 5. Expect the latter resolution to carry over to both the iPhone 5C and 5S. Once Apple increases the screen size, though, tradeoffs arise. Assuming they stick with the 16:9 ratio common to widescreen TVs and the current iPhone, Apple has a few choices, none of which are great.

There are rumors that they may launch in China this month. Apple is looking into making iPhones with screen sizes between 4.8 and 6 inches. This shows that Apple is changing its smartphone strategy to compete with companies like Samsung. Samsung has a big share of the smartphone market because they have different devices at different prices and sizes. Apple might follow a similar strategy in the future. This could help Apple grow, especially in countries like China where there are many first-time smartphone buyers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article with the title: \\"OPEC is broken: Dennis Gartman\\"","output":"Title: OPEC is Broken: Dennis Gartman Introduction: In recent years, the global oil market has been marked by volatility and fluctuating oil prices. This has raised questions about the effectiveness and relevancy of OPEC, the world's leading oil cartel. Dennis Gartman, a renowned economist and author of The Gartman Letter, has been vocal in his critique of OPEC's ability to fulfill its role in the modern economic landscape. This article will discuss Gartman's views on the reasons behind OPEC's demise and the implications for global oil markets. Step 1: Describe Gartman's background Before delving into Gartman's perspective on OPEC, it is essential to establish his credibility. Dennis Gartman, an American economist and commodities expert, has over four decades of experience in international markets. His daily newsletter, The Gartman Letter, offers insight into financial markets to a vast clientele, including banks, hedge funds, and family offices. Step 2: Present Gartman's criticism of OPEC Gartman's main argument against OPEC revolves around its slow reaction to the growing prominence of shale oil and alternative energy sources, as well as its inability to maintain market stability. OPEC, acting as a cartel rather than a competitive market player, has struggled to adapt to the evolving landscape of the energy sector. Step 3: Highlight the role of technological advancements Gartman argues that technological advancements and innovations have played a significant role in diminishing OPEC's influence. The shale revolution, in particular, has allowed the United States to rapidly increase its oil production, rivaling traditional OPEC powerhouses and weakening the cartel's ability to dictate oil prices. Step 4: Discuss geopolitical factors impacting OPEC In addition to technological developments, Gartman also emphasizes the impact of geopolitics on OPEC's decline. Rising tensions between OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Venezuela have contributed to a lack of unity within the organization, further hindering its ability to effectively manage oil production and global prices. Step 5: Examine the significance of alternative energy sources Moving forward, Gartman suggests that the increasing adoption of clean and renewable energy sources could further challenge OPEC's dominance in the energy sector. With the world steadily transitioning towards sustainable energy, the cartel's grip on global oil markets may continue to weaken. Step 6: Analyze the implications for global oil markets Gartman's assertion that OPEC is broken holds significant implications for the global oil markets. As the cartel loses its influence, the era of oil price stability may come to an end, leading to increased market volatility and uncertainty. Furthermore, as countries diversify their energy portfolios, the traditional prominence of OPEC nations in the energy sector may wane, dramatically changing the geopolitical landscape. Conclusion: Dennis Gartman's claim that OPEC is broken is rooted in the organization's inability to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics of the global energy sector. As technological advancements continue to reshape the industry and the global shift towards sustainable energy sources gains momentum, it appears that OPEC will continue to struggle to maintain its influence on the world stage. The potential consequences for global oil markets and geopolitics are vast, signaling that the world may be on the brink of a new era in the energy sector."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nepali mountaineer Ang Rita Sherpa last week broke his own record of the number of climbing Mt. Everest. Can we infer the following? Alison Hargreaves is the first woman to have made the climb up the Everest with no artificial oxygen.","output":"While it is true that Ang Rita Sherpa, a legendary Nepali mountaineer, broke his own record by climbing Mount Everest multiple times, this fact alone does not necessarily allow us to infer information about Alison Hargreaves' achievement. To answer whether Alison Hargreaves became the first woman to climb Mount Everest without artificial oxygen, we need to delve into historical records and information about the accomplishments of female climbers on Mount Everest. Alison Jane Hargreaves, a British mountaineer, is known for her commendable ascents in the world of mountaineering, and she indeed made history. Hargreaves was born on February 17, 1962, in Derbyshire, England, and displayed an early inclination towards climbing, which she pursued professionally as an adult. In May 1995, Alison Hargreaves made headlines by becoming the first woman to successfully reach the summit of Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen or support from a Sherpa team. This remarkable achievement distinguished her in the climbing community and made her a well-respected mountaineer worldwide. Unfortunately, Hargreaves' life was tragically cut short when she died at the age of 33 during her descent from K2, another challenging and dangerous peak, later in August 1995. It should be noted that Ang Rita Sherpa's record-breaking climb and Alison Hargreaves' feat occurred independently from one another and that their historical significance is unrelated. While Ang Rita Sherpa's accomplishments showcase his extraordinary skill, perseverance, and ability to adapt to high altitudes, Hargreaves' ascent demonstrates the power and determination of women in mountaineering and the ability to conquer such a demanding summit without the assistance of extra oxygen supplies. In conclusion, we cannot make this inference based solely on the statement about Ang Rita Sherpa breaking his own record, but after researching and verifying the information, it is clear that Alison Hargreaves did indeed become the first woman to climb Mount Everest without the use of artificial oxygen. Both Hargreaves and Sherpa's accomplishments serve as an enduring source of inspiration for mountaineers and adventure seekers worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: What structures formed of twisted actin chains are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape?   A: OPTIONS:  (1). RNA  (2). DNA  (3). vesicles  (4). microfilaments","output":"A: The correct answer is (4). Microfilaments. Microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are found in nearly every eukaryotic cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They have a diameter of about 7 nm and are one of the three main components of the cytoskeleton, which also includes intermediate filaments and microtubules. Microfilaments play an essential role in maintaining the structural integrity, shape, and motility of a cell. The primary protein component of microfilaments is actin, a globular protein that can polymerize to form long helical chains known as filamentous actin (F-actin). The process of forming F-actin filaments involves the reversible polymerization of G-actin monomers, creating a dynamic structure that enables rapid disassembly and reassembly based on a cell's needs. The addition of G-actin to either end of a filament is regulated in a spatial and temporal manner, typically occurring at one end (barbed or plus end) while being removed from the other (pointed or minus end). In muscle cells, microfilaments are crucial for muscle contraction. They organize into contractile units called sarcomeres within myofibrils. Sarcomeres contain two types of filaments: thin filaments made of actin and thick filaments made of myosin, another motor protein. The interaction between actin and myosin filaments enables muscle contraction as part of the sliding filament model, with myosin heads pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere during contraction. Cells that move by changing shape also rely on microfilaments. They undergo a process called amoeboid movement, where cells extend membrane protrusions called pseudopods, which help propel the cell forward. Microfilaments support the formation of these protrusions, providing the necessary force. Additionally, the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments regulate cell membrane activities such as endocytosis (uptake of external materials) and exocytosis (secretion or release of materials). Microfilaments serve other significant functions as well. They form structures called stress fibers, which resist mechanical forces and help maintain cellular rigidity. In epithelial cells, they comprise cell-cell junctions (adherens junctions) and cell-matrix junctions (focal adhesions), which are crucial for tissue organization and integrity. In comparison, the other options provided are not composed of twisted actin chains: (1) RNA: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a single-stranded nucleic acid that is essential in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and catalysis. RNA does not consist of actin chains. (2) DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-stranded helical molecule that encodes genetic information and serves as the blueprint for all cellular processes. DNA does not contain actin chains. (3) Vesicles: Vesicles are small, membrane-enclosed sacs within cells that transport, store, or process materials such as proteins, lipids, and waste products. They are not formed of actin chains. In summary, microfilaments, composed of twisted actin chains, are the structures present in almost every cell, including muscle cells and cells that move by changing shape. They play crucial roles in cellular shape, motility, and structural integrity, making them essential components of the cytoskeleton."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Wilhelm II (Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern; 27 January 1859 - 4 June 1941) was the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, ruling the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918. He was the eldest grandchild of the Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and related to many monarchs and princes of Europe, most notably King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Acceding to the throne in 1888, he dismissed the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in 1890. He also launched Germany on a bellicose \\"New Course\\" in foreign affairs that culminated in his support for Austria-Hungary in the crisis of July 1914 that led in a matter of days to the First World War. The impetuous young Kaiser, says John C. G. Rohl, rejected Bismarck's \\"peaceful foreign policy\\" and instead plotted with senior generals to work \\"in favour of a war of aggression.\\" Bismarck told an aide, \\"That young man wants war with Russia, and would like to draw his sword straight away if he could. I shall not be a party to it.\\" Bismarck, after gaining an absolute majority in favour of his policies in the Reichstag, decided to make the anti-Socialist laws permanent. His Kartell, the majority of the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, favoured making the laws permanent, with one exception: the police power to expel Socialist agitators from their homes. The Kartell split over this issue and nothing was passed.  As the debate continued, Wilhelm became more and more interested in social problems, especially the treatment of mine workers who went on strike in 1889. He routinely interrupted Bismarck in Council to make clear where he stood on social policy. Bismarck sharply disagreed with Wilhelm's policy and worked to circumvent it.  Bismarck, feeling pressured and unappreciated by the young Emperor and undermined by his ambitious advisors, refused to sign a proclamation regarding the protection of workers along with Wilhelm, as was required by the German Constitution. The final break came as Bismarck searched for a new parliamentary majority, with his Kartell voted from power due to the anti-Socialist bill fiasco. The remaining powers in the Reichstag were the Catholic Centre Party and the Conservative Party. Bismarck wished to form a new bloc with the Centre Party, and invited Ludwig Windthorst, the party's parliamentary leader, to discuss a coalition. Wilhelm was furious to hear about Windthorst's visit. In a parliamentary state, the head of government depends on the confidence of the parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure his policies a majority, but in Germany, the Chancellor had to depend on the confidence of the Emperor, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his ministers' meeting. After a heated argument at Bismarck's estate over Imperial authority, Wilhelm stormed out. Bismarck, forced for the first time into a situation he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy, which was published only after Bismarck's death.  Although Bismarck had sponsored landmark social security legislation, by 1889-90, he had become disillusioned with the attitude of workers. In particular, he was opposed to wage increases, improving working conditions, and regulating labour relations. Moreover, the Kartell, the shifting political coalition that Bismarck had been able to forge since 1867, had lost a working majority in the Reichstag. At the opening of the Reichstag on 6 May 1890, the Kaiser stated that the most pressing issue was the further enlargement of the bill concerning the protection of the labourer. In 1891, the Reichstag passed the Workers Protection Acts, which improved working conditions, protected women and children and regulated labour relations.","output":"This text is about Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor (Kaiser) and King of Prussia."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Scores on a national test released on November 1 show that students in the U.S.A. have improved in math over the last two years, but mostly stayed the same in reading. This year, 422,000 fourth graders and 343,000 eighth graders took the exams between January and March. Students were asked to read grade-appropriate  materials and answer questions for the reading test. For the math test, students answered questions about geometry, algebra, number properties, measurement and other topics. The U.S Department of Education released the scores in a report called The Nation's Report Card (NAEP). This year, students earned the highest scores ever recorded on the math exam, which has been given since 1990.Fourth graders scored an average of 241.That is a one-point increase from 2009and a 28-point increase from 1990. Eighth graders made similar progress. Then average score this year was 284,up one point from 2009 and 21 points from 1990. In reading, fourth graders scored an average of 221 points, the same average score since 2007.That score is four points above those from 1992, when the first reading test was given. Eighth graders scored an average of 265 points, up one point from 2009 and five points from 1992. Education experts say reading is a harder subject to improve in the classroom than math. While math is largely learned in classrooms, reading results depend on how much kids read outside of school and how much they read in other subjects, such as history and science. On the NAEP, math scores were the highest among students who have limited use of calculators  during math lessons, compared with students who have unlimited use or no use. Reading scores were the highest among students who said they read for fun on their own time almost every day. Question: In 1990, the fourth graders' average score on the math exam was about  _ - 238 - 240 - 213 - 220 Answer:","output":"In 1990, the fourth graders' average score on the math exam was about 213. This can be determined from the information provided in the article, which states that fourth graders scored an average of 241 in the most recent test, which is a 28-point increase from 1990. Therefore, subtracting 28 points from the current score of 241 gives us the 1990 average score: 241 - 28 = 213."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sylvia Plath (; October 27, 1932 - February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer. Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \\"did not want her children to have to read it.\\" He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.  Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.  In October 2015 the BBC Two documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes' life and work and included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father.  In 2017 it was revealed that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead. The letters were sent to Dr. Ruth Barnhouse (then Dr. Ruth Beuscher).

The team played at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, county, and state governments sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, the Seattle Mariners, who began play at the Kingdome in 1977. The Mariners struggled in the stadium and moved to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs four times, all between 1995 and 2001, despite having Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. Since 2001, the Mariners have failed to qualify for the playoffs—the longest active postseason drought in North American sports, at 17 seasons. From 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001.

A:","output":"The article does not directly mention which league will be bringing an expansion team in 2021 to the city that once housed the Seattle SuperSonics. However, considering the context and the history of Seattle's sports teams, it is safe to assume that the question refers to the National Hockey League (NHL). In December 2018, NHL Board of Governors approved a proposal to expand the league and awarded Seattle a new franchise, which is set to begin play in the 2021-2022 season.

Q:Information:  - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation.  - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. For example, the problem of factoring  - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time .  - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\"  - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'np-hardness' with the relationship of 'subclass of'.

It is said that the cliff holds a mysterious power that binds the entire town's fate. For generations, the townsfolk have lived peacefully, never daring to venture into the cave, believing that uncovering its secrets would unleash an unspeakable evil upon their land. Our protagonist, Alice, a young and fearless dreamer, struggles to live up to the expectations of her traditional family and her village. She's always been fascinated by the tales of the hidden cliff and all that it symbolizes. The more she tries to resist her curiosity, the stronger it grows, persuading her to go on a quest to uncover the truth behind the ancient legend. As the story unfolds, Alice rallies her band of unlikely heroes: her childhood friend, Sebastian, a brilliant but timid mapmaker; Luna, a rebellious huntress with unparalleled tracking skills; and Thomas, a mystical figure with the ability to speak to the spirits of nature. Together, they embark on a treacherous journey, facing trials that test their unity, strength, and resilience. Along their path, they encounter mythical creatures and mystical beings, learning valuable lessons about faith, courage, and the fragility of life. As they navigate through treacherous terrain and face challenging puzzles, they realize that their destinies have been intertwined since birth and that each of them possesses unique abilities that complement one another. As they venture deeper into The Wailing Hollows, the group stumbles upon the remains of a lost civilization that hints at an even greater mystery surrounding the cliff. This discovery urges them to acknowledge the complexity and depth of the legend, doubting the version that has been passed down for generations in Seraphim's Cove. Finally, after surpassing an array of challenges, Alice and her friends stumble upon the hidden cliff inside the cave. The cliff itself is a breathtaking, colossal structure covered with ancient runes that hum with magical energy. At the edge of the cliff, Alice finds a mystical stone that, when touched, unveils a powerful vision of the town's true history. The vision reveals that, centuries ago, the cliff was the primary source of magical energy for a benevolent race known as the Etherians. However, a great calamity struck that weakened the source of energy within the cliff, causing the Etherians to be on the brink of extinction. The Etherians knew that, in time, the cliff's power would diminish, and only a chosen few with pure hearts and strong spirits would be able to restore it. In an emotional climax, Alice realizes that her curiosity and dreams were not coincidences, but signs that she is one of the chosen ones mentioned in the vision. The group unites their newfound abilities and restores the power within the cliff. Their selfless act resurrects the Etherians, who grant them their heartfelt gratitude and eternal friendship. Ali and her friends journey back to Seraphim's Cove, changed forever. They assure the townsfolk that the hidden cliff is not a threat, but a symbol of hope and balance, teaching them that, in order to grow stronger, they must be willing to explore the unknown and embrace the wonders that lie deep within their own souls. The movie ends with the mythical cliff still standing strong as a homage and reminder to the people of Seraphim's Cove of what it means to dream, to believe, and to embrace the inexhaustible power of unity and hope."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric.

A: Pick from: 1. particle field. 2. magnetic field. 3. wave field. 4. electric field. A:","output":"During travel through a potential difference, an object primarily gains or loses its energy to the electric field (option 4).  An electric field surrounds electric charges, and when an electrically charged object moves through a potential difference, it experiences the force exerted by this electric field. This force leads to a change in the object's potential energy, which can be converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy. In simple terms, an object gains or loses energy while moving from a higher potential point to a lower potential point or vice versa due to the presence of the electric field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who deeply cares for Rebecca? Movie title: Womb Movie plot: The film commences with a pregnant woman (Eva Green) telling her unborn child that the father has departed for good, but that together they will start a new life. A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship. Tommy is a political activist fighting against the biotech corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by cloning. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy. Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a pleo, an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a \\"copy smell\\" as the girl is a clone. The neighbourhood mothers display prejudice against \\"copies\\", expecting Rebecca to not let Tommy associate with them. Rebecca,... A:","output":"Tommy deeply cares for Rebecca.

A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive. Survive? Yes. I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film. There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling (why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess. Obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy/Heathcliff character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it isn't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film, I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it. I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence... Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan. I didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.

As the first African American to play in the Major League in modern times, many believe he changed the country forever. Robinson was born in 1919. He lived in a time when rules controlled what African Americans could do. He was a top athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball. But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947. He believed that Robinson not only had the skills, but the courage to face the challenge of becoming modern baseball's first black player. It wasn't easy. Robinson sometimes faced boos   from fans. But he became a star, anyway. In 1962, he became the first African-American player chosen to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress can give to an American.

Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Twenty rabbis flew to Birmingham to support the cause, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home.

Penalties on Washington's defense helped allow a short McNabb to Brian Westbrook touchdown pass on Philadelphia's opening drive. A fumble by L. J. Smith gave Washington the ball inside Eagle territory, and Jason Campbell capitalized with a touchdown pass to James Thrash, the former Eagle. The extra point was missed, but Campbell hit Thrash for another score later in the second quarter. The two-point conversion failed, leaving it 12-7 Washington. A Redskin field goal stretched Philadelphia's deficit to 15-7 in the third quarter, but L. J. Smith, who spent much of the early season injured, caught an eight-yard touchdown from McNabb. The Eagles went for two to try to tie it, but were not successful. Campbell fired back with his third touchdown pass, this one to Keenan McCardell, to make it 22-13. McNabb needed five plays to get the points back, launching a 45-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Brown for the touchdown. Ladell Betts fumbled the ball away in Eagle territory on Washington's next possession, but McNabb was sacked and fumbled it back to the Redskins on the next play. The Redskins eventually had first-and-goal from the three-yard line, but the Philadelphia defense had yet another huge goal-line stand, and Washington settled for a field goal to go up 25-20. The Eagles got the ball back with four minutes to play, and Westbrook immediately took a short pass and broke free for a 57-yard touchdown to go ahead 26-25 (the two-point conversion failing again). The defense came up big again, with Mike Patterson sacking Campbell to jar the ball loose, and Trent Cole recovering. Westbrook carried it in from ten yards out to seal the deal. McNabb, who surpassed Ron Jaworski for the most career completions in franchise history (2,090 at game's end), passed for 251 yards and four touchdowns in the 33-25 win.

I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A.

White Brazilians descended from the original Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) of the population in the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.Because of the existence of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians. Answer:","output":"The majority group in Sao Paulo province was White Brazilians, which included descendants of the original Portuguese settlers as well as other European immigrants such as Italians, Spaniards, and Germans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And if he wins the nomination, such issues will almost certainly rise again, given that he will run against a war hero, in Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is advised by several veterans of the campaign against Mr. Kerry. Mr. Obama himself seemed chastened by the re-emergence of the old politics last week. “Let’s be honest,” he said in an interview on NBC. “You know, here I am, an African-American named Barack Obama who’s running for president. I mean, that’s a leap for folks. And I think it’s understandable that my political opponents would say, ‘You know, he’s different. He’s odd. He’s sort of unfamiliar. And what do we know about him?’ ” There is a subtext for this history lesson: Mr. Obama’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, is running hard on the notion that she is the more electable candidate, that what she calls her “baggage” has been thoroughly vetted, and that she has survived 16 years of the harshest Republican attacks. But David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, argues that any Democratic nominee will be subject to the same withering attacks on values and character. “The question,” Mr. Axelrod said, “is whether given the abysmal state of our economy, given the war, given all the challenges that people sense we face that have led George Bush to have the lowest rating ever, do you believe that voters are going to be distracted from the fundamental need for change? I think the answer to that is no.” In fact, as Mr. Axelrod suggests, these are very different times. Twenty years ago, the nation was in an era of comparative peace and prosperity; a sense of crisis did not hang over the election. Today, with the war in Iraq in its sixth year and the economy stumbling, more than 8 in 10 Americans say the country is on the wrong track. A new generation of voters have entered the electorate, who may not be as susceptible to values issues. In such a climate, it would presumably be far more difficult than in 1988 to keep the campaign focused on symbolic, values-related issues, or matters of personality. There are differences, as well, in the political skills of the candidates then and today: Mr. Obama rose to national prominence largely on the basis of his oratorical skills, and has never been accused of lacking vision; Mr. Dukakis based his campaign on a prosaic promise of managerial competence and “good jobs at good wages.” And yet, some veterans of past Democratic campaigns say, there are similarities, as well. Even with so many big issues at stake this time around, the race between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton has often been focused on questions of values, background and character — witness the recent fixation on Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., or the continued unfounded rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim. Like Mr. Dukakis in 1988, Mr. Obama is relatively new to the national scene, and thus vulnerable to being defined by Republican attacks. And like Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Obama lacks experience with the politics of wedge issues on a national stage. Attacks on a presidential candidate’s patriotism are hard for many politicians to take seriously. “Unless you’re talking about the Manchurian candidate, the idea that someone who put their heart and soul into running for president didn’t care deeply for their country is kind of ridiculous,” said Drew Westen, a psychologist and political consultant. Still, one of the clearest strategic errors of 1988 was the Democrats’ failure to realize that such attacks could stick and open the door to broader efforts to portray Mr. Dukakis as fundamentally out of sync with the nation’s values. “The attacks against Dukakis, which were systematic and attacked his patriotism, did a lot of damage to him,” said Tad Devine, a top advisor to the Dukakis campaign and the campaign of Mr. Kerry in 2004. “They developed words and phrases that essentially said this guy is not part of the mainstream.” If Mr. Obama is the nominee, Mr. Devine said, “I think it will happen again, and it will be aimed at both the candidate and his wife.” Michelle Obama has already drawn conservative fire for declaring that, because of her husband’s success and the voters’ hunger for change, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country.” And Mr. Obama has been questioned about why he does not wear a flag pin every day. In 1988, one of the central attacks revolved around the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Dukakis, as governor, had vetoed state legislation in 1977 that required teachers to lead their students in the pledge. He did so on the basis of an advisory opinion from the state court, which said the legislation was unconstitutional. Mr. Dukakis, a Harvard lawyer surrounded by other Harvard lawyers, believed himself on very firm ground. But by August 1988, his Republican opponent, Vice President George H.W. Bush, was rousing huge crowds with a contemptuous question: “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?” Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bush said, was “out in deep left field on these issues.” He was also “a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.,” more concerned with giving furloughs to criminals — like Willie Horton — than upholding national values, the vice president asserted. “I simply can’t understand the kind of thinking that lets first-degree murderers out of jail on a furlough and won’t deal with the Pledge of Allegiance,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Dukakis defended his patriotism and scoffed at Mr. Bush for wrapping himself in the flag, but, in essence, lost control of the campaign and his own image. After his loss, in 40 states, many Democratic leaders swore they would never be caught off guard that way again. Mr. Obama faces different issues, beginning with Mr. Wright, who suggested last week that the United States was attacked by terrorists because it had itself engaged in terrorism; Mr. Obama has now denounced his former pastor. He has been challenged, as well, about his relationship with a former radical from the 1960s; Mr. Obama says he simply served on the board of a foundation with the man. The questions may be taking a toll: The New York Times/CBS News Poll last week found 29 percent found him “very patriotic,” compared with 40 percent who felt that way about Mrs. Clinton, and 70 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war. The lessons of history are fairly clear for Democrats, said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime Clinton ally. “Republicans have been trying to put us in the same box for 40 years now,” Mr. Reed said. “We win elections when we don’t let them.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ’88 Campaign Offers a Lesson In Using Symbols as Bludgeons.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"three years\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many years passed between Portugal declaring bankruptcy and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"three years\\" does not correctly answer the question.

On his way to Paris, however, he meets up with Monsieur Rochefort. D'Artagnan does not know that his rivalry with Monsieur Rochefort will get him involved in a battle against the evil plot thought up by Cardinal Richelieu against the king and queen of France. When Cardinal Richelieu discovers that the queen had sent valuable diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham in England, a country enemy of France, the cardinal uses the information to blackmail the queen and create a difficult situation between her and King Louis, who now believes his wife to be in love with the Duke of Buckingham. Nobody knows that the diamonds are in possession of an old woman, Milady, who had stolen the diamonds from the duke and had brought them for Rochefort so that they would be nowhere to be found; Rochefort allows her to hold on to the diamonds in order to ensure this. Shortly after entering the academy of musketeers, D'Artagnan meets three of the finest among them, Porthos, Athos and Aramis. Though their first meeting had not gone well and had led to the challenging of several duels, the four of them become fine friends shortly after, since all four fight against the Cardinal's soldiers.

Cardinal Richelieu orders all of the queen's closest friends to be arrested so that no one will be able to defend her once King Louis decides to have her beheaded. D'Artagnan defends Constance when a group of soldiers try to insolently have her arrested and then takes her to the safety of the queen.

Read the question: How would Quinn feel afterwards? 3. Choose the correct answer from the given options (A, B, or C) based on the context and your understanding of social situations. Now, let's follow the steps to find the answer: 1. Analyze the context: Quinn told Tracy his/her opinions or feelings about Tracy's new boyfriend. It seems like Quinn is sharing an honest reaction with Tracy. 2. Understand the question: We need to determine how Quinn would feel after sharing the intended reactions with Tracy. 3. Evaluate the options using the context and social understanding:    (A) in love: Quinn might have feelings for Tracy or the new boyfriend but, that's not necessarily related to the outcome of conveying his/her reaction.    (B) embarrassed: This option could be plausible since sharing one's opinion about others' romantic choices might lead to embarrassment.    (C) angry: The context does not hint at any reason for Quinn to be angry after sharing his/her reactions. Based on our evaluation, the most suitable answer is (B) embarrassed. Quinn may feel embarrassed after sharing his/her opinions about Tracy's new boyfriend with her."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn’t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out – and they knew him. But many researchers, especially at the start of their careers, don’t... Question: Why isn't achieving impact easy?

Question: Who died in the accident? Title: Rails & Ties Movie plot: Laura Danner is a mentally ill, single mother who takes illegal drugs and is unable to care for her 10-year-old son Davey. Driven to despair, she decides to commit suicide by driving a car on to a railway track, taking Davey with her. She offers him some tranquillisers beforehand but, unbeknownst to her, he spits them out. His mother drives on to the tracks. As a train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers. Davey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Susan Garcia. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother. Later on, after being confined to his room, he escapes by shattering the window. The authorities are alerted and a missing persons search is initiated. The boy obtains train conductor Tom Stark's home address. He turns up at the Starks' home and berates Tom for accidentally killing his mother in the train crash, but eventually he is placated.

Q: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? === The answer to the above question is OPTIONS: -- Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. -- not enough information -- They will be enrolled in a study. -- They will call their doctor.

There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. Question: What caused milk prices in California to increase?

I'd like to increase my income so I can buy X. I'd like to have the respect and admiration of the smartest people at our company.'\\" It also can be worthwhile to visualize a default future, a scenario of what is likely to be if you don't change your work habits. Imagining another mediocre performance review or the pit in your stomach when a co-worker gets the promotion you were eyeing can provide the incentive needed to take action. 2. Take time for professional development. Wishing is one thing, action is another. Identify the skills you need to progress in your career. Take classes and seminars accordingly, and read books to expand your expertise. Making yourself more knowledgeable and relevant can open up new opportunities and renew your passion (as well as give others a more favorable impression of your abilities and commitment). Remember your mother worrying about who you hung out with in high school? The company you keep in the workplace can likewise have a negative influence. Distance yourself from the office slackers. The bad attitudes and habits that are keeping you back are likely being enabled, tolerated or encouraged by others. Instead, evoke positive peer pressure by surrounding yourself with hard-working colleagues who share your career goals.

Article: Since I was a child, I called my father my Kong, after King Kong. I believed that he was just as strong as the giant ape . As he faced death, _ . Two months after he passed away, my sister called to ask if I would like to go see Lisa Williams, a well-known witch . I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go. I took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \\"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\\" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged  my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly. Although I sensed his presence, I wasn't confident enough to raise my hand. I needed something a bit more concrete, something undoubted. \\"This man is letting me know he had cancer,\\" she continued. I nudged my sister harder and assured her this was our father. Lisa went on to say that this person died in June (my father had died June 8th). There was swelling of the legs. \\"Important information,\\" she called out. My heart beat fast . I jumped up when she asked, \\"Who is holding his watch?\\" I waved the watch in the air. \\"He wishes you congratulations.\\" My fourth child was born three weeks after my father died. I was in shock and could not believe I was getting a chance to hear from him, yet I knew our bond was strong enough that he could come to the world. She banged on her chest like an ape and apologized, saying, \\"I don't know why but he wants me to do this like Tarzan.\\" It didn't resonate  with me until my sister called out \\"King Kong!\\" I was convinced. No way could this woman have ever known a detail unless Dad was communicating through her. Each bit of information she gave us was just as meaningful.

Solve -90*t + 13*t - 2388 = 1693 for t.","output":"To solve the equation -90*t + 13*t - 2388 = 1693 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. Since both -90*t and 13*t are terms with t, we can add them together: -90*t + 13*t = (-90 + 13) * t = -77*t Now the equation becomes: -77*t - 2388 = 1693 Step 2: Add 2388 to both sides of the equation. To isolate the term with t, we'll remove the constant -2388 from the left side. To do this, we'll add 2388 to both sides of the equation: -77*t - 2388 + 2388 = 1693 + 2388 -77*t = 4081 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -77. Now we need to solve for t by getting it alone on one side. We'll do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -77: (-77*t) / -77 = 4081 / -77 t = -53 So the solution to the equation is t = -53."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately, this app fell a bit short of my expectations. The installation was straightforward, and the user interface seemed rather simple, which initially is a good sign. However, upon using the app, I found that it was slow to connect to the Tor network, often taking a couple of minutes to establish a connection. I understand that the Tor network helps maintain anonymity, but I was still put-off by the apparent sluggishness. Speaking of anonymity, the app claims to offer robust security and privacy features, but it feels like it could still use some improvement in this area. It is worth mentioning that, on occasion, the app would automatically disconnect from the Tor network without any warning, potentially compromising privacy. The browsing experience within the app offered limited customizability. The absence of a user-friendly and customizable interface left much to be desired. Though the app provides access to .onion sites, the lack of reliable search engines presented difficulty in actually locating the desired content. While I appreciate the ability to access the Tor network from my smartphone, I believe that org.torproject.android needs significant improvements in terms of speed, security, and general user experience to warrant a higher rating.

Washington (CNN) -- A seven-term Wisconsin congressman, who 54% of the American people were not aware of last week, just knocked the president of the United States off of his perch as the most talked-about politician on the largest social media platform in the world. According to the exclusive Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, in the first 54 hours after being announced as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, sucked up the political oxygen in the social media landscape -- with the Beltway topping the buzz and his home state of Wisconsin close behind. What caught our eye? The swing states of Virginia (where Ryan was announced) and New Hampshire were also high on the list: Yet the growth wasn't just in buzz, but also in \\"likes\\" -- the","output":"fundamental currency of Facebook. In the same 54-hour period, Rep. Paul Ryan experienced a remarkable surge in popularity, with his official Facebook page seeing a significant boost in both likes and user engagement. This sudden increase not only suggests that his selection as vice-presidential nominee sparked widespread interest in his background and policies, but also exemplifies the power of social media as a tool for political communication and outreach. Upon deeper analysis, one can attribute this phenomenon to a few interconnected factors. First and foremost, the announcement of Ryan's selection as Romney's running mate was timed strategically, ensuring that it would dominate headlines and social media conversations during a critical period in the presidential campaign. Additionally, the relative obscurity of Ryan prior to this moment amplified the curiosity and intrigue surrounding his candidacy, leading many users to seek more information on his policies and qualifications via Facebook and other digital channels. Another key element contributing to this social media explosion was the concerted effort by Republican and conservative-leaning groups to promote Ryan's candidacy and solidify support among the party base. These organizations leveraged their social media presence to share news, endorsements, and other positive messages related to Ryan, further amplifying  the conversation and driving web traffic to his official Facebook page. Moreover, the geographical distribution of the social media buzz indicates that the Romney campaign's decision to make the announcement in Virginia and Ryan's connection to the critical swing state of Wisconsin were deliberate choices. These states, in addition to New Hampshire, are vital for Republicans to win if they hope to secure victory in the electoral college. As a result, Ryan's surge in Facebook activity serves as a gauge of political enthusiasm and support in these crucial regions. Lastly, the growth in Facebook likes highlights the importance of social media as an essential platform for modern political campaigns. As traditional channels of communication like print media and television continue to decline in influence, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have emerged as key battlegrounds where presidential campaigns engage with the public, respond to real-time events, and shape the narrative surrounding their candidates. As evidenced by the Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter data, timely and strategic announcements can lead to dramatic shifts in online sentiment and buzz, allowing campaigns to capitalize on momentum and galvanize their base. In summary, the meteoric rise of Rep. Paul Ryan's Facebook popularity following his announcement as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate can be attributed to a combination of strategic timing, effective messaging, and the power of social media as a platform for political engagement. Whether this online surge translates into electoral success remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: in today's digital age, social media's influence over public opinion and election outcomes cannot be underestimated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several scenes did make me jump (which is a rarity for me in modern horror films), most notably the scene in the bathtub, the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.

Along the way, he meets Sarah, an aspiring writer, who shares in his quest for truth and completes the gaps in the story he uncovers. Together, Albert and Sarah discover that James was indeed a soldier in the First World War - but that he did not die on the battlefield. It turns out James was taken as a prisoner of war and, after a daring escape, he had been living a new life in hiding, ashamed of the haunting memories of war and the acts of brutality he was forced to commit as a soldier. Through a close family friend, whom Albert and Sarah interview, they learn that James was torn between the desire to return home to Mary and their child and the fear of retribution he might face for deserting the war. Ultimately, his devotion to the family led him to make a heart-wrenching decision: he sacrificed himself in a high-risk operation to save the lives of several fellow soldiers, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of those who mattered. As Albert learns the truth, he confronts his mother and discovers her reason for concealing the true story. Mary, aware of James' struggles, wanted to protect her son from the darker aspects of his father's life. In her eyes, it was better for Albert to remember his father as a hero, fallen in the line of duty. In the end, Albert and Sarah choose to immortalize James' story in a book, detailing the complexities of a man, caught between his duty and love. The book becomes a bestseller and helps many families heal from the wounds of World War I. Mary learns to embrace the truth and finds new love with a kind-hearted veteran, while Albert and Sarah's friendship blossoms into romance, both finding solace in the memories of the past and hope for the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This move demonstrates the country's proactive approach in combating this highly contagious disease and protecting both animal and human populations. Step 1: Identify the Threat Canadian health authorities have identified an outbreak of avian flu, specifically the H5N1 strain, in poultry farms across the country. This disease poses a significant threat not only to birds, but also to humans who could potentially contract the virus. Step 2: Establish a Control Zone To effectively combat the spread of the avian flu, Canada has set up a control area, which is a designated region encompassing infected farms and surrounding areas. This enables health authorities to monitor and regulate the movement of birds, equipment and personnel within the zone, preventing further dissemination of the virus. Step 3: Implement Strict Biosecurity Measures Farm owners and workers within the control area are required to observe strict biosecurity measures to limit the virus's transmission. These include wearing protective gear, regularly disinfecting premises, and avoiding the transfer of birds between farms. The general public is urged to report any signs of sick or dead wild birds around the affected areas as well. Step 4: Monitor and Test Domestic and Wild Birds Health authorities will conduct regular testing and monitoring of both domestic and wild birds to determine the extent of the virus's spread. This entails collecting samples from live and dead birds and analyzing them for avian flu strains. Step 5: Quarantine and Cull Infected Birds Infected birds will be subjected to quarantine and culling measures to prevent further contamination. This helps to limit the spread of the disease to other farms and birds, reducing the potential for human exposure and fatalities. Step 6: Maintain Transparent Communication To ensure public trust and cooperation, the Canadian government is committed to providing accurate and timely information on the avian flu outbreak, control area, and containment efforts. This is crucial for maintaining proper preventive measures and addressing concerns from citizens. Conclusion: Canada's establishment of a control area to fight the avian flu outbreak is a testament to the nation's commitment to safeguarding both animal and human health. By monitoring the spread of the virus, implementing biosecurity measures, and maintaining open communication with the public, authorities aim to halt the outbreak and prevent future occurrences of the disease."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The fortifications of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie were moved east of Utrecht. The town walls could now be demolished to allow for expansion. The moats remained intact and formed an important feature of the Zocher plantsoen, an English style landscape park that remains largely intact today. Growth of the city increased when, in 1843, a railway connecting Utrecht to Amsterdam was opened. After that, Utrecht gradually became the main hub of the Dutch railway network. With the industrial revolution finally gathering speed in the Netherlands and the ramparts taken down, Utrecht began to grow far beyond the medieval centre. In 1853, the Dutch government allowed the bishopric of Utrecht to be reinstated by Rome, and Utrecht became the centre of Dutch Catholicism once more. From the 1880s onward neighbourhoods such as Oudwijk, Wittevrouwen, Vogelenbuurt to the East, and Lombok to the West were developed. New middle class residential areas, such as Tuindorp and Oog in Al, were built in the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, several Jugendstil houses and office buildings were built, followed by Rietveld who built the Rietveld Schröder House (1924), and Dudok's construction of the city theater (1941).

Bean wins the first prize in a raffle - a holiday involving a train journey to Cannes, a video camera, and â¬200. Following a misunderstanding involving a taxi at the Gare du Nord, a railway station in Paris, Bean is forced to make his way unorthodoxly towards the Gare de Lyon to board his next train towards Cannes. However, a vending machine prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train, giving him an hour to sample French seafood cuisine. Back on the platform, Bean asks a man, who happens to be Russian movie director Emil Duchevsky (Karel Roden), to use his camcorder to film him walking onto the train. Bean makes a big fuss and keeps asking for retakes, so by the time they are done, the train is about to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Duchevsky can get on. Duchevsky's son, Stepan (Max Baldry) is therefore left on board by himself. Bean attempts to befriend the boy, who has been told to get off at the next station, and eventually comes to his rescue at the station, unfortunately missing his train again. The train Stepan's father has boarded does not stop at the station, and a mobile number is held up, with the last two digits covered by his fingers. Attempts at calling the number prove fruitless.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash.

The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned.

Upon their September 2007 releases, Graduation outsold Curtis by a large margin, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and selling 957,000 copies in its first week. Graduation once again continued the string of critical and commercial successes by West, and the album's lead single, \\"Stronger\\", garnered the rapper his third number-one hit. \\"Stronger\\", which samples French house duo Daft Punk, has been accredited to not only encouraging other hip-hop artists to incorporate house and electronica elements into their music, but also for playing a part in the revival of disco and electro-infused music in the late 2000s.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.  Question: \\"How did the tradecraft of each of the 9/11 plotters go to fund the terrorist activities of 9/11?\\" Response: \\"They didn't provide any funds themselves personally. It was all provided by Al Qaeda and KSM\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Options:  A. because it makes you work  B. because it gives you incentive  C. not enough information  D.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Diane Lane, Josh Brolin Split Josh Brolin and Diane Lane are calling it quits after eight years of marriage. “Diane Lane and Josh Brolin have decided to end their marriage,” their reps confirmed in a statement to ABC News. Brolin, 45, whose latest film is “Gangster Squad,” and Lane, 48, star of “Cinema Verite” and “Under the Tuscan Sun,” married in 2004. They have no children together. This will be the second divorce for both. Lane was previously married to “Tarzan” actor Christopher Lambert from 1988 to 1994. Brolin’s first marriage was to actress Alice Adair, with whom he has two children, Trevor, 24, and Eden, 18. Brolin started off 2013 in handcuffs, with a misdemeanor public intoxication charge on New Year’s Day. Read More About Brolin’s New Year’s Day Arrest “New Year’s, that’s what happened,” Brolin told “Good Morning America” last month about his arrest. “I’m the one guy who’s out there and they go, ‘Hey that’s Josh. Let’s grab him.’” The Associated Press reported that Brolin was not given a citation for the arrest and will likely not have to appear in court. Brolin said the incident, which made headlines, was blown out of proportion. “It was New Year’s. It was a pretty innocent thing. It was a fun thing,” he said. “The most awful thing about it is you see this shot of me, they don’t show you the other shot when I turn and I have a huge smile on my face.”","output":"In this news article, they talk about two famous actors, Josh Brolin and Diane Lane.

Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.

The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family. It was indeed — until 1869. Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy. The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism. By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society. The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers. This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century. Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression. Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells. Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water. Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon. Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial. Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse. The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself. In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese. Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts. After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.  After reading the above, is \\"Japanese scholars\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\"?","output":"No, \\"Japanese scholars\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\". Based on the information provided, it was the Taira and Minamoto armies who were involved in the conflict related to Kyoto, not the Japanese scholars. The text states that after rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage a four-year war. This conflict marked the end of the golden age of the Heian court. The Taira, who controlled the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies, which were based in the Kanto province east of the capital. Therefore, a more suitable answer to the question \\"Who invaded Kyoto and what was the outcome?\\" would be \\"The Taira and Minamoto armies\\", and the outcome was that the Taira defeated the Minamoto.  However, it should be noted that the text does not explicitly say that either army \\"invaded\\" Kyoto. The text instead talks about a struggle for control over the throne.

A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket.  Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes. A:","output":"The original owner of the weaving company in the article is old MacPherson. According to the information provided, he lives at Moray Place, as mentioned when Martin is called to his death-bed. To provide a more detailed context, the story is set in Edinburgh, Scotland, with Martin working as a head accountant in the New Town area. The weaving company is a traditional business with weavers scattered across the islands, and old MacPherson passes away just as a new owner, portrayed by Robert Morley, takes over. The new owner's interest in an American efficiency expert threatens the traditional way of the weaving company and results in a series of events throughout the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Where is  Dr. Kate Forster moving to? Title: The Lake House Movie plot: In 2006, Dr. Kate Forster (Bullock) is leaving a lake house that she has been renting in Madison, Wisconsin to move to Chicago. Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived. Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the house's restoration, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate witnesses a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, Persuasion, at a train station where Kate said she had lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox.

Movie title: Legend Movie plot: \\"Once, long ago\\", the ancient Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) laments his isolation in the shadows before sensing the presence of two unicorns who safeguard the Power of Light; where upon Darkness instructs Blix (Alice Playten) and his fellow goblins Pox (Peter O'Farrell) and Blunder (Kiran Shah) to kill the unicorns and bring him their horns to free himself. Meanwhile, Princess Lily (Mia Sara), a mischievous and vibrant girl goes alone to the forest to meet her love interest Jack (Tom Cruise), an adventurous forest dweller who teaches her the languages of animals before showing her the unicorns as he promised he would someday do. Against Jack's pleas, Lily approaches the stallion to stroke him, making him distracted and the perfect target for a poisoned dart from Blix's blowpipe. Once hit, the unicorns bolt, and Lily makes light of Jack's fears and sets him a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring that she will marry whoever finds it. Jack, proving his love to Lily, dives into the pond to retrieve it. As the stallion dies from the poison and the goblins seize his horn, the forest and the pond freeze, setting the mortal realm into an apocalyptic winter. Lily runs off in terror before Jack can break the surface of the frozen pond. Taking refuge in a frozen cottage, Lily overhears the goblins talking about their slaying of the unicorn and testing the alicorn's magical powers. She follows them to a rendevouz with Darkness, who orders them to hunt down the mare. In a fit of overconfidence, Blunder challenges Darkness with the stallion's horn in hand, but is instead restrained and taken away. In the forest, Jack encounters the elf Honeythorn Gump (David Bennent, voiced by Alice Playten). Joined by Gump, the fairy Oona (Annabelle Lanyon), and the dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball (Cork Hubbert and Billy Barty), Jack searches for Lily before coming across the lifeless stallion and his mate. Knowing that the horn must be recovered and returned to the stallion, Jack is led by Gump and the others to a cache...

A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

Given the question: Q: What is caused by human actions that releases chemical substances and particles into the air?    Choices:  - CFO pollution  - Improper Emissions  - heavy pollution  - air pollution  A: The answer is:","output":"- air pollution Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that affects both developed and developing nations across the world. It is primarily caused by human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the air, thereby degrading the quality of the environment and causing various negative effects on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Several factors are responsible for the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, including: 1. Industrial processes: Industries, such as power plants, manufacturing centers, and chemical plants, are significant contributors to air pollution. These facilities release a range of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 2. Transportation: The combustion of fossil fuels in motor vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, produces a significant amount of harmful emissions, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and hydrocarbons. Moreover, air travel and shipping also contribute to air pollution through the release of exhaust fumes. 3. Agriculture: The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in farming contributes to air pollution by releasing ammonia and other harmful substances into the air. Additionally, agricultural practices, such as livestock farming and open burning of crop residues, emit methane, particulate matter, and other pollutants. 4. Residential and commercial activities: Burning of solid fuels like wood, coal, and charcoal for cooking and heating purposes, particularly in developing countries, adds to the burden of air pollution. Residential and commercial buildings may also emit VOCs from materials used in their construction, furnishings, and other household items. 5. Waste disposal: The improper handling and disposal of waste, such as open burning of garbage and emissions from landfills, can introduce hazardous pollutants into the air. 6. Deforestation and forest fires: The loss of forests due to human activities, such as logging and agriculture, is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, forest fires contribute to air pollution by releasing massive amounts of smoke and particulate matter into the atmosphere. 7. Natural events: Although not directly caused by human actions, certain natural events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires can exacerbate air pollution levels. Air pollution has numerous adverse effects on the environment and human health. It can cause respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and other health problems, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Air pollution also harms ecosystems, leads to reduced crop yields, and contributes to climate change. To address these problems, various mitigation strategies and policies have been implemented by governments worldwide, including air quality standards and regulations, public transportation initiatives, and the promotion of cleaner, renewable energy sources. Additionally, increasing public awareness and individual actions to reduce emissions can also help in tackling air pollution. In conclusion, air pollution is caused by various human actions that release harmful chemical substances and particulate matter into the atmosphere. It poses a significant threat to global environmental health and has far-reaching implications on human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Therefore, continuous efforts must be made to combat air pollution and mitigate its adverse effects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An agricultural farm is giving prizes for the person who makes the largest homegrown project. Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them.

The fall was said to have been due to recent housing options and homelessness prevention actions offered by councils. There was also a reduction in the number of households with children in temporary accommodation. And the number of people made homeless or threatened with homelessness fell by a 10th to 7,649. The statistics showed that the number of people in temporary accommodation increased slightly over the year to June (0.3%) to 10,494 but was about 6% lower than the peak period in early 2011 when temporary placements were in excess of 12,000. The 2,821 households with children in temporary accommodation was a decrease of 472 households (14%) from the previous year. These households contained a total of 4,574 children, a decrease of 727 children (14%). The number of children in bed and breakfast accommodation halved to nine. However, the statisticians said there had not been a major change in the underlying drivers of homelessness. Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess welcomed the \\"continued fall in homelessness across Scotland\\", which she said built on the Scottish government's \\"historic achievement\\" in meeting the homelessness 2012 target. She added: \\"Over the past few years councils have been developing services in which staff assist households to consider their range of housing options to address their individual housing needs in order to help prevent homelessness before it occurs. \\"Alongside this we want to increase housing supply to ensure settled accommodation can be accessed by households as quickly as possible and avoid them spending too much time in temporary accommodation. \\"Increasing the supply of affordable housing is a vital part of our efforts to build a better and fairer Scotland.\\" The Scottish government aims to deliver 30,000 affordable homes - including 20,000 for social rent - over the life of the current parliament. It is also to make Â£900m available for affordable housing over the next three years. The Scottish Conservatives said the number of people in temporary homeless accommodation had increased from 8,523 to 10,494 since the SNP came to power in 2007. The party claimed a failure by the Scottish government to build new houses had contributed to the issue. Scottish Conservative housing spokesman Alex Johnstone said: \\"There will always be a need for temporary accommodation in Scotland. \\"However, the use of B&Bs and hotels should be absolutely discouraged, because this is not suitable accommodation for anyone. \\"Some families and individuals can be in these settings for long periods of time, a situation which is anything but temporary.\\" Scottish Labour welfare spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \\"Whilst the number of households with children in temporary accommodation is decreasing, the fact that there are a thousand more such households now than a decade ago raises significant questions about how the SNP government is trying to tackle homelessness. \\"It can be no surprise that the numbers have remained stubbornly high after the SNP withdrew millions from the house building budget, which has seen a collapse in the number of new homes for rent.\\" Graeme Brown, director of housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: \\"It is good news that 11% fewer families and individuals are experiencing the trauma of homelessness. \\"However, homelessness in Scotland is still too high and we cannot afford to be complacent or lose sight of the fact that over 7,649 households found themselves homeless in just three months.\\" He added: \\"The root cause of homelessness is a housing crisis which has seen the housing safety net stripped apart after decades of under-investment. \\"The only way forward is for the Scottish government to build at least 10,000 new social homes a year to bring hope to the 155,100 on local authority housing waiting lists and much-needed jobs to the construction sector.\\" David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the ongoing reduction was down to the strong emphasis in Scottish government policy placed upon homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment. But he added: \\"We are concerned that, with the rollout of the UK coalition government's welfare reforms, come some serious challenges to homelessness service provision which could undermine some of the excellent homelessness prevention and tenancy sustainment work carried out by social landlords and others here in Scotland.\\" What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a decrease in the number of homeless people in Scotland. It tells us that fewer families and individuals are homeless because of more housing options and help provided by councils. The number of people in temporary homes, like hotels, has also gone down.

The high-flying lawyer, married to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, insisted she wanted to be able to combine a successful professional life with having a family. Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband does his share of the chores, with one of them making sure they are at home every evening for their three sons. Miriam Clegg insisted she does not want to 'have it all', but wants to be able to combine a successful career with family life. Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow. In a surprise intervention at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mrs Clegg spoke about how she juggles her career with raising her children, Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all'. But speaking to Sky News, she made clear that the decision to choose Mr Clegg as her husband and father of her children was more important to her than any lifestyle aspirations. And she said she had been fortunate to be able 'naturally' to find a way to share household chores and childcare duties with her politician husband. Spanish-born Mrs Clegg was speaking during a visit to a Glasgow college to address female students as part of the Inspiring Women campaign to enable girls to meet successful women from all walks of life who can act as role models. Asked whether she was able to provide the girls with an example of how women can 'have it all', Mrs Clegg told Sky News: 'I never understand what people mean when they say 'having it all'. I personally have never wanted to 'have it all' as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. 'Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. 'There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. 'But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with.' Mrs Clegg said she makes sure her husband Nick does his share of the household chores, and they try to make sure one of them is at home each evening for their sons. Nick and Miriam Clegg visited Castehill Primary School in Glasgow. Nick Clegg has looked to his wife Miriam to help the Lib Dems in the 'fight of our lives' to stay in power. The Lib Dem leader admitted his party faces a tough battle to cling to office after the general election in May, but insisted he would set out red lines for entering a new coalition with either the Tories or Labour. Asked if he would rather get into bed with David Cameron or Ed Miliband in a new power-sharing deal, Mr Clegg joked 'it's Miriam every single time', as he was joined by his wife for a photo opportunity in a school yesterday. She made clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was ready to share housework with her, and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. 'There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children,' she said. 'If you look across society and across different countries, certainly in the Western world, women still get a very big proportion of the chores at home and I certainly know lots of women who before they leave to go to work have done half a day's work at home, and when they get home there is the other half to do. 'That doesn't happen to me. It is not an issue for people like you and I who can get help. It is an issue for those who can't get help, who don't have the money or circumstances to get help. Asked whether she had worked out in advance with her husband what compromises they would have to make to combine two high-flying careers with a family life, she said: 'Life is all about compromises. 'There is always a certain equilibrium and in my case, we found it naturally, but I do understand that there are people who plan. I'm just not very good with plans. 'We tend to share it very naturally. We make a point of one of us being home most evenings and on the whole we manage.' Mrs Clegg said she had not suffered from open sexism in her professional life, and felt it was important to give girls the self-confidence to aim high in the world of work. 'I think we have made a lot of progress, but there is still a little bit more progress to make,' she said. 'I think it is good for the girls to see the many options that are available for them. 'I haven't come across open discrimination against me. In terms of a little hidden sexism, I think there are lots of women who do face that.' Mrs Clegg yesterday joined her husband on a visit to Castlehill Primary School, Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Clegg said that when speaking to young women around the UK, 'something I have really noticed that I don't see so much from boys is we get lots of questions about self-confidence'. She added: 'I wonder if there is something a little bit specific to girls there, and in particular in relation to certain subjects - science subjects. 'I do think it is important to celebrate female achievement and aiming high as part of the lesson we want to give to the girls that aiming high is as good for girls as it is for boys.' Asked if she would give her sons different advice to that which she offers girls, Mrs Clegg said: 'Not necessarily. I go on with my boys about how you have to make an effort and everything really depends on you. 'If you really want to summarise what I hope that at the end of the whole educational process they would retain, I hope it is that.' Unlike her husband, she was seen wearing only two different outfits yesterday. Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for a visit to a school. She later changed into a beige dress and bright orange shoes for her husband's question-and-answer session.

David brings his eight-year-old son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and Norton to a grocery store, where the patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Moments after a panicked and injured man, Dan (Jeffrey DeMunn), runs in warning of danger, a thick mist envelopes the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors and the town's tornado siren. A man disregards the warnings and is attacked while running to his car. A mentally unstable religious woman, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), decides that this is the beginning of Armageddon. A shaken woman (Melissa McBride), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children and disappears. While investigating the store's generator, a bag-boy named Norm (Chris Owen) volunteers to go outside, but is snatched and pulled into the mist by a tentacle connected to an unseen monster. Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, only to be attacked and killed, prompting the rest of the survivors to barricade the shop-front windows. That night, enormous insects land on the windows and pterodactyl-like animals attack them, breaking the glass and allowing the creatures to begin fighting inside the store. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors. A trip to the neighboring pharmacy to gather medical supplies goes horribly wrong and two people are killed by giant spiders. Mrs. Carmody's faction now contains most of the survivors. Two soldiers commit suicide, and a third, Private Jessup (Samuel Witwer), reveals that the local military base was filled with rumors about the Arrowhead Project, the government's attempt to look into other dimensions, and that the scientists responsible...

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the common English name of the animal that has eight subspecies?, using the article: The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The common English name of the animal with eight subspecies, as described in the article, is the hartebeest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Early breakaway riders Thomas de Gendt, Wilco Kelderman and Cyril Gautier were caught with 200 metres remaining. Britain's Froome, 30, remains two minutes and 52 seconds ahead of second-placed Tejay van Garderen. American Van Garderen, who finished 10th but with the same time as Froome, had few opportunities to make up ground on the yellow jersey holder on a stage that lacked drama until the final minutes. Froome, having showed his resilience in the previous stage by holding off attacks from his general classification rivals, had a more straightforward time in the peloton on a day when temperatures of up to 38C proved the most troubling factor for riders. The steep finish on Saturday's 178.5km route to Mende may offer slight grounds for optimism to Froome's prospective GC contenders. \\"We already saw on a 500m climb like today gaps opening up, so tomorrow on a climb like Mende at 3km and more than 10%, I definitely think the general classification guys will be fighting to gain time,\\" said Froome. Stage 13 came agonisingly close to being won by a breakaway rider, but Belgian De Gendt, Dutchman Kelderman and France's Gautier, having led the field for the whole day, were overhauled by the peloton on the streets of Rodez with the finish line in sight. The final incline allowed the peloton to catch them with BMC rider Van Avermaet, 30, claiming his first Tour stage win by finishing stronger than Sagan, who has not won a Tour stage in two years. \\"I was dead, really dead,'' said Van Avermaet. \\"I thought I'd caught second. I pushed for the line and was so happy he didn't overtake me.\\" The result takes Tinkoff-Saxo rider Sagan's number of second-place finishes in his Tour career to 15, compared with just four victories. Sagan, 25, who keeps hold of the green points jersey, told ITV4: \\"It's not about luck. It was my mistake for waiting too long. \\"I was pushing in the saddle and then sat down.

Please write a short summary for the following article: For Health Care for All chief, a spiritual shift Chris Morris for the boston globe Amy Whitcomb Slemmer is on track to be ordained in June. After eight years as executive director of Boston-based Health Care for All, Amy Whitcomb Slemmer (right) is passing the baton — and as of next year her new title may be “The Rev. Amy Whitcomb Slemmer.” While leading the nonprofit advocacy group, Slemmer, a lawyer, has been studying to become an Episcopal priest. She is now enrolled in her final seminary class and on track to be ordained in June, contingent on the approval of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, Alan M. Gates. But she is confident enough in her path to the priesthood that she has submitted her resignation from Health Care for All, effective Oct. 15, although she’s not yet sure what her new religious life will be or if she’ll remain in Massachusetts. “I am deciding and figuring out my next professional adventure,” said Slemmer, noting that she does not feel drawn to parish ministry. “I know I am most excited when I get to work on issues of social justice, and I am positive that whatever my next job is will include the intersection of my faith and my pull to work on social justice.” Slemmer, 52, has felt the tug of the priesthood since she was a teenager, but delayed pursuing that aspiration because she was a single mother and wanted to focus on raising her daughter, who is now in her 20s. During Slemmer’s tenure at Health Care for All, the organization helped implement Massachusetts health care reform, enrolling thousands of people in health insurance. She was previously executive officer of American Red Cross Biomedical Services in Washington, D.C. Following Slemmer’s departure, Health Care for All’s interim executive director will be its founder, Rob Restuccia, who is now executive director of Community Catalyst, a Boston nonprofit that advocates for affordable health care. — SACHA PFEIFFER Early findings from the city of Boston’s groundbreaking gender wage project are starting to come in, as Mayor Marty Walsh and local CEOs meet on Friday to dissect the data. The information comes from the first batch of about 70 companies that have volunteered to participate in the project so they can better understand why pay disparities exist. Over 160 companies — including Partners Healthcare, State Street, Putnam Investments, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals — have agreed to report pay data to the city. Since the data collection is at an early stage, the numbers won’t be released publicly. About 200 executives and managers are expected to attend the event with roundtable discussions led by 18 CEOs. Among those expected include Staples CEO Shira Goodman, Massachusetts General Physicians Organization CEO Thomas Lynch, Children’s Hospital CEO Sandra Fenwick, and Babson College president Kerry Healey. “We are so appreciative to have the leadership of these 160 companies to engage in this very important dialogue on how we go beyond legislation and change culture to close the gender wage gap in Boston,” said Meg Costello, executive director of Mayor Walsh’s office of women’s advancement. — SHIRLEY LEUNG Houghton Mifflin Harcourt may have shown Linda Zecher the door, but the company isn’t eager to let her management team walk away. Zecher resigned from her job as chief executive at the Boston-based publisher last week, following a rocky year for the company’s stock. The board appointed former Wall Street Journal publisher L. Gordon Crovitz to be interim CEO while the search for a new chief executive is underway. Crovitz has been a board member at HMH since 2012. Crovitz is currently a partner in NextNews Ventures, which invests in early-stage news startups. Meanwhile, HMH offered cash retention bonuses to chief financial officer Joe Abbott, executive vice president Lee Ramsayer, chief content officer Mary Cullinane, and general counsel William Bayers. They’ll be payable in two installments: The execs will get one half if they stay on for a full year, and they’ll get the rest after two years. Bayers’s bonus is 250,000 while the others would get 500,000. Larry Fish, the former Citizens Bank CEO who is now HMH’s chairman, issued a statement praising Zecher for her work. He also gave props to Zecher’s top lieutenants, calling them “world class.” Public praise, of course, can help employee morale, and do wonders for executive retention. But extra money doesn’t hurt, either. — JON CHESTO It’s official: Governor Charlie Baker will head to Israel in December for his first overseas trade mission. Boston business leaders have long expected Baker to participate in the upcoming trade mission, although Baker’s aides didn’t confirm it until Wednesday. The governor is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Dec. 9 and to depart on Dec. 14, returning home early on Dec. 15. The trade mission will focus on the cybersecurity and digital health sectors. One goal: encouraging Israeli companies that are seeking their first US outpost to pick Massachusetts. “I want Massachusetts to be a place that companies and researchers and investors in Israeli enterprises in this space choose to partner with, as opposed to going to Silicon Valley or New York,” Baker said. Roughly a dozen state officials will attend the trip, including: Katie Stebbins, assistant secretary of innovation and technology; Louis Gutierrez, executive director of the Mass. Health Connector; and Mark Nunnelly, executive director of the state’s information technology office. The administration is still lining up private-sector participants; nearly 40 are expected to attend. The New England-Israel Business Council is playing a key role. No public funds will be used for the upcoming Israel visit. Instead, it will be funded by Combined Jewish Philanthropies, much like the June trip. (Business leaders typically pay their own way.) “They came back from that [June trip], saying there’s a tremendous opportunity,” Baker said. “If they came back from that trip and said, ‘There really aren’t a lot of possibilities here,’ we wouldn’t be doing this.” — JON CHESTO Summary:","output":"Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, the executive director of Boston nonprofit Health Care for All, is set to resign on October 15th to become an Episcopal priest.

The group becomes embroiled in a high-stakes heist, attempting to steal a valuable artifact from a dangerous criminal organization – The Shadow Cartel. The heist was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but their plan goes horribly wrong, leading to their arrest by the local authorities. Samantha, a young lawyer with a passion for justice, has heard of the four friends and their daring schemes in the past. Moved by their bravery, she grows determined to get them out of jail – not just for their benefit, but also to make sure that the sinister Shadow Cartel doesn't get their hands on the artifact. As the four friends sit in jail, awaiting their trial, they start to lose hope of ever regaining their freedom. The Shadow Cartel pulls strings and influences the legal system; they plant fabricated evidence that could lead to a conviction. Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron realize they are fighting against a force that seems unstoppable. Meanwhile, Samantha relentlessly investigates the case and uncovers a vast conspiracy involving not just the Shadow Cartel, but corrupt local officials, too. Together with her resourceful assistants, she will stop at nothing to vindicate her clients and reveal the truth. Samantha conceives of a bold plan to rescue the four friends, proving their innocence by capturing the real culprits and retrieving the valuable artifact. Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron manage a daring jailbreak with Samantha's help. Together, they set forth to confront the Shadow Cartel and expose the conspiracy in a thrilling climax. In a heart-pounding final showdown, Samantha and the four friends outmaneuver the Shadow Cartel, finding evidence that could exonerate them and take down the syndicate. As Samantha presents the evidence in court, she delivers a passionate speech defending Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron against the corrupt system.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured the distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.\\",  answer the following question.

Title: The White Ribbon Movie plot: The action takes place in a German village in the fifteen months that precede World War I.Among the people who live there are a baron, who is a large landowner and a local moral authority, his estate manager, a pastor with his many children, a widowed doctor and a schoolteacher who is thinking of getting married. It is he who, many years later, tells this story.Though everything seems to be quiet and orderly, as it always has been, with the seasons following each other, and good harvests following bad ones, suddenly some strange events start to occur. If some appear to be quite ordinary, even accidental -- a farmer's wife dies falling through rotten floorboards -- others are inexplicable and may well be malevolent.Thus, a wire placed at knee-height has brought down the horse being ridden by the doctor, who is severely wounded.There's more of the same: an unknown hand opens a window to expose a newborn baby to the intense cold of the winter. A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip. A barn belonging to the manor is set on fire. A farmer hangs himself. A midwife's handicapped child is found tied to a tree, in a forest, seriously beaten, with a threatening message on his chest speaking of divine punishment.The village is worried, and at a loss as to what to do. The baron whose wife will soon leave the village to go to live in Italy makes a speech in the church, but it has no effect. The pastor, a particularly strict character, had since the beginning of the events, tied a white ribbon to the arm of his two eldest children, a boy and a girl: it is to remind them permanently of their duties to purity.

The answer is:","output":"Al Capone, the infamous American gangster, went to jail at multiple locations during his notorious criminal career. However, his most famous stint in prison took place at the United States Penitentiary, Alcatraz Island, more commonly known as Alcatraz or \\"The Rock.\\" Capone's criminal activities came under increasing scrutiny by federal authorities, especially for his involvement in the illegal liquor trade during the Prohibition era. Nevertheless, it was tax evasion charges that eventually brought Capone down. He was indicted by the federal government on various charges in 1931, and on October 17, 1931, he was convicted of five counts of tax evasion and two of failure to file tax returns.  Initially, Capone was incarcerated at the Cook County Jail in Chicago while awaiting sentencing. On October 24, 1931, he was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison, fined 50,000, charged 7,692 for court costs, and required to pay an additional 215,000 plus interest in back taxes. This was one of the harshest punishment ever handed down in a tax evasion case up to that point. Capone began serving his term on May 4, 1932, at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. However, Capone's status started causing trouble in the prison, as he managed to gain special privileges and smuggle in luxuries. In response, the authorities decided to transfer him to a more secure, escape-proof, and highly disciplined institution – Alcatraz. On August 22, 1934, Al Capone was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, where he would serve almost five years of his sentence. Alcatraz was notorious for its high level of security and strict rules, and Capone would not receive any special treatment. During his time on the island, he struggled with health issues. He battled with paresis, a complication resulting from late-stage syphilis, and his physical and mental condition began to deteriorate. In January 1939, Capone was transferred to another federal prison, Terminal Island, in Southern California, as his condition worsened, and he required further medical attention. He was finally released on November 18, 1939, after serving approximately seven and a half years of his initial 11-year sentence. In summary, Al Capone served time in multiple jails: Cook County Jail in Chicago, the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, and finally, Terminal Island in Southern California. However, it was his stay at Alcatraz that remains the most famous and emblematic of his time in incarceration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Brad and Henry were two old friends in their 70's. Brad had very high levels of cholesterol, while Henry was healthier and had normal levels of cholesterol.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend takes a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Answer:","output":"In the given situation, Brad and Henry are two old friends in their 70's, with Brad having very high levels of cholesterol while Henry has normal cholesterol levels. From the provided background information, we know that individuals with high cholesterol often take a specific type of drug called a statin. Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These drugs work by inducing the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. Increased levels of LDL receptors lead to increased catabolism of plasma LDL, effectively removing cholesterol from the plasma and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Considering this information, it would be reasonable to infer that Brad, who has very high cholesterol levels, is the friend that takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This is because Brad's high cholesterol levels make him more susceptible to atherosclerosis, and thus, he requires medical intervention to help manage his cholesterol levels. By taking a statin, Brad can potentially lower his cholesterol, as the drug promotes the increased expression of LDL receptors and the removal of cholesterol from his plasma. On the other hand, Henry has normal cholesterol levels and is generally healthier. It is likely that he does not require a statin to manage his cholesterol levels, as his body is already maintaining an appropriate balance. However, it is important to note that the efficacy of statins can vary among individuals due to different genetic backgrounds and factors related to pharmacogenomics. The varying responses to the drug among individuals are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms, which contribute to the uniqueness of each person's genetic makeup. As a result, different versions of statins exist, allowing healthcare professionals to identify and apply the most effective combination of drugs for each individual. In summary, it is likely that Brad, who has high cholesterol levels, is the friend who takes a drug (a statin) that induces the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This medication is designed to help him manage his cholesterol levels and prevent atherosclerosis, while Henry's normal cholesterol levels likely do not necessitate the use of such a drug."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both sentences convey the same information—the source of the information (Iranian state news agency PressTV), the organization that conducted the poll (The Doha Debates), and the key finding of the poll (55% of Syrian respondents did not want Assad to resign). Although the sentences are worded differently, they communicate the same message. Sentence (1) uses the word \\"poll\\" whereas Sentence (2) uses the word \\"survey\\" – both terms typically refer to a method of collecting opinions or information from a sample of people, usually to generalize about a larger population. So, in this context, they can be considered synonyms. Additionally, both sentences use the term \\"respondents\\" to describe the individuals who participated in the poll or survey. This term refers to the people who provided their opinions or responses, and it is a standard term used in polling and survey research. As such, the sentences convey the same meaning with respect to the participants in the poll/survey. In summary, there is no meaningful difference in the information conveyed by these two sentences. Both provide a summary of the poll results as reported by the Iranian state news agency, PressTV, and conducted by The Doha Debates. The only differences are the choice of synonyms and the slight variance in sentence structure, but both sentences clearly express the same overall message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"No, OK Go and Ozma were not from the same city. OK Go is an American alternative rock band which was originally formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1998, while Ozma is an American rock band that was formed in Pasadena, California, in 1995. Let us delve deeper into the background and history of each band. OK Go's founding members include Damian Kulash (vocals, guitar), Tim Nordwind (bass, vocals), Dan Konopka (drums, percussion), and Andy Ross (guitar, keyboards, and vocals). The band originally was formed based on Kulash's and Nordwind's friendship since their pre-college years. During their time at the Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan, they bonded over their shared love for music and formed the foundation of what would later become OK Go. The name \\"OK Go\\" is derived from an art teacher's verbal cue, which the duo found amusing, and they adopted it as their band name. The band gained popularity primarily for their innovative and creative music videos, which often feature intricate choreography and unconventional cinematography. Some of their most notable works include the music videos for \\"Here It Goes Again,\\" which features the band members performing on treadmills, and \\"This Too Shall Pass,\\" which showcases a Rube Goldberg machine. On the other hand, Ozma, which was formed by Ryen Slegr (vocals, guitar), Jose Galvez (guitar, vocals), Patrick Edwards (drums, percussion), Daniel Brummel (bass, vocals) and Star Wick (keyboards, vocals), drew its name from the mythical Queen Ozma of Oz, a character from L. Frank Baum's Oz books. Ozma's sound is a fusion of various musical styles, including rock, alternative, power pop, and new wave, often characterized by catchy melodies and strong guitar hooks. The band is perhaps best known for their album \\"Rock and Roll Part Three,\\" which includes popular tracks like \\"Domino Effect\\" and \\"Natalie Portman.\\" Although both bands hail from different cities and have distinct musical styles, they do share some similarities, such as the usage of catchy hooks, innovative ideas, and strong fan bases. Additionally, OK Go and Ozma have both toured together and shared the stage on multiple occasions, further solidifying their connection in the American rock and alternative music scene. In conclusion, OK Go and Ozma do not come from the same city – OK Go originated in Chicago, Illinois, while Ozma was formed in Pasadena, California. Although their geographical locations are different, their shared passion for music, sense of innovation, and collaboration in the music scene have brought them together in various instances, making them relevant and influential names in the world of alternative and rock music over the years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet  is heading towards the earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the earth. On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out. Will we meet the same end? Question: Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long? Answer: Answer:","output":"The northern half of the earth can't escape for long because of the global consequences of the comet's impact. After the explosions, the sun gets hidden by the clouds of dust produced from the impacts, causing temperatures around the world to fall to almost zero. This leads to ruined crops and an inability to grow food. As a result, wars break out among countries as they fight for limited food resources. The harsh conditions and conflict lead to a significant loss of life, even in the northern half of the earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: [1]. no; [2]. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. They both revolve around the impact of alcohol on health, with Question 1 asking if alcohol is good for health and Question 2 inquiring about the potential positive or negative effects of drinking alcohol on health. Although the wording is slightly different, the core inquiry of both questions remains the same. The impact of alcohol on health can be quite complex, and it can be both good and bad depending on the amount consumed, individual factors, and the type of alcohol being consumed. Studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption, particularly of wine, can have some benefits for certain individuals in terms of heart health, digestion, and stress reduction. However, these benefits should be weighed against the potential negative effects of alcohol consumption. On the other hand, excessive alcohol consumption has been clearly associated with several health issues, including liver damage, addiction, a weakened immune system, increased risk of certain cancers, and psychological disorders. It can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and interfere with certain medications. Binge drinking is particularly harmful and can lead to severe health issues, as well as accidents and injuries. It is essential for individuals to assess their personal risk factors and the potential benefits and drawbacks when considering their level of alcohol consumption. Some people may have a higher risk of developing health problems due to alcohol than others, and factors such as family history, age, existing health conditions, and individual reactions to alcohol should all be considered. In some cases, it might be advisable to avoid alcohol entirely. In conclusion, while alcohol can have some health benefits when consumed moderately and responsibly, it can also have serious negative effects on an individual's health if consumed irresponsibly or excessively. It is crucial for people to be aware of their personal risk factors and to understand the potential consequences of their alcohol consumption habits, in order to make informed decisions about their health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham?  In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force.  They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.  Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.  He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776.  Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights.  With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command.  After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands. The answer is:","output":"Ethan Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the paragraph The relevant information can be found in the sentence: \\"He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.\\" Step 2: Determine the context of the surrender demand From the same sentence, we understand that the surrender demand was made by a person whose first name is asked.

Step 4: Determine who made the demand among these two leaders Considering the first part of the sentence: \\"Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace.\\" This indicates that the person in question is Ethan Allen.

This may be because, in their opinion, black is related to darkness and white to purity. However, that is not always the case. Did you know that the same one color may mean something differently in different places of the world? In the English-speaking world, black is the color of mourning--people wear black at the funeral. Red is concerned with danger or bloodshed . Yellow is the word for fear. If you are afraid, you are yellow. Yet none of these sayings is true outside the English-speaking world. In China and Korea white is the color of mourning. In Russia, China and some other countries, red stands for beauty, life and excellence. In Italy and Germany, you are yellow with anger, not with fear. Even within the English-speaking area, it is not difficult to find color contradictions .A redcap in the United States is a porter in a railway station. In Britain, however, a redcap is a military policeman. Both names are logical, because both men wear red caps. Similarly, the British term for an American white-collar worker is sometimes called a black-coated worker. One does not have to cross an area to find color differences. Would you rather be red-blooded or a blue-blooded? If we go back to the origin, we find that both terms are logical as both names suggest. The expression \\"blueblood\\" comes from Spain, where some noble families proudly told the world that they had \\"blue blood\\". Actually they meant that they had no Moorish or Jewish blood. But then why \\"blue\\" blood? Because they were fair-skinned, and it is only natural that their blood vessels  stood out appearing blue.

Background: Elizabeth of York (11 February 1466 - 11 February 1503) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death. As the wife of Henry VII, she was the first Tudor queen. She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III, and she married the king following Henry's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses. She was the mother of King Henry VIII. Context: Elizabeth's mother made an alliance with Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII, who had the closest claim to the throne of those in the Lancastrian party. Although Henry Tudor was descended from King Edward III, his claim to the throne was weak, due to an act of parliament passed during the reign of Richard II in the 1390s, that barred accession to the throne to any heirs of the legitimised offspring of Henry's great-great-grandparents, John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford. Despite this, his mother and Elizabeth Woodville agreed Henry should move to claim the throne and, once he had taken it, marry Elizabeth of York to unite the two rival houses. In December 1483, in the cathedral in Rennes, Henry Tudor swore an oath promising to marry her and began planning an invasion.  In 1484, Elizabeth of York and her sisters left Westminster Abbey and returned to court when Elizabeth Woodville was reconciled with Richard III, which may suggest that Elizabeth Woodville believed Richard III to be innocent of any possible role in the murder of her two sons (although this is unlikely owing to her involvement in Henry Tudor's failed invasion of October 1483). It was rumoured that Richard III intended to marry Elizabeth of York because his wife, Anne Neville, was dying and they had no surviving children. The Crowland Chronicle claimed that Richard III was forced to deny this unsavoury rumour. Soon after Anne Neville's death, Richard III sent Elizabeth away from court to the castle of Sheriff Hutton and opened negotiations with King John II of Portugal to marry his sister, Joan, Princess of Portugal, and to have Elizabeth marry their cousin, the future King Manuel I of Portugal.  On 7 August 1485, Henry Tudor and his army landed in Wales and began marching inland. On 22 August 1485, Henry Tudor and Richard III fought the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard III, despite having the larger army, was betrayed by one of his most powerful retainers, William Stanley, and died in battle. Henry Tudor took the crown by right of conquest as Henry VII.

However, he arrived home in tears after teachers told him off about the cut. He will be isolated at his Bedfordshire school until his hair is 'rectified' Article:","output":"Title: 9-Year-Old Danny Purdy Faces Isolation Over Haircut Inspired by Football Hero Olivier Giroud Introduction: Danny Purdy, a nine-year-old boy from Bedfordshire, was excited to finally get a haircut modeled after his football hero, Arsenal star Olivier Giroud. After saving up £7 of his own money, Danny got his dream haircut, only to be left in tears when his teachers took issue with the style. Step 1: Establish the significance of the story This incident of a young boy being reprimanded for emulating his hero highlights the ongoing debate surrounding strict school dress codes and how they may affect students' self-expression and identity development. Step 2: Describe the specific haircut Danny Purdy carefully saved up his pocket money to get a haircut resemlling that of his favorite football player, Olivier Giroud. The hairstyle features a distinctive undercut, with shorter sides and a longer top, giving it a bold and unique look that has become a signature style for the Arsenal star. Step 3: Discuss the school's reaction Upon arriving at school with his new haircut, Danny was met with disapproval by his teachers. They deemed the style inappropriate and informed him that he would be isolated from his peers until the haircut was 'rectified.' This left the nine-year-old devastated and in tears. Step 4: Consider the impact on the child The condemnation of Danny's haircut by his school has raised concerns about the potential emotional impact on the young boy. The tears shed by Danny upon returning home suggest that the school's response has already taken a toll on his self-esteem and enthusiasm for expressing himself through his appearance. Step 5: Analyze the broader implications of dress code enforcement Danny's story raises the question of whether strict enforcement of school dress codes, including hairstyles, is appropriate or fair to students. While schools may argue that such policies promote a sense of unity and professionalism, critics contend that they may hinder creativity, individuality, and self-expression in children. Conclusion: The case of young Danny Purdy and his Olivier Giroud-inspired haircut serves as a reminder of the delicate balance that must be struck between upholding school dress codes and respecting students' personal identities. In light of Danny's emotional response to the school's demands, it may be time for a broader reconsideration of school policies that prioritize conformity and uniformity over individuality and self-expression."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: Not worth the 30 bucks Product review: This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history.

Summarize this article: A top producer of “The View” has been fired by ABC brass for brashly berating former host Rosie O’Donnell in front of the show’s entire staff, Page Six has exclusively learned.      Jennifer Shepard-Brookman, a senior producer who has worked at the ABC daytime show for over eight years, was “profoundly and publicly disrespectful” to O’Donnell in front of the whole staff at a production meeting in early February, show insiders told us.      Shepard-Brookman’s behavior towards O’Donnell was so brutal, we’re told that staff, including O’Donnell herself, complained to ABC’s human resources department. Shepard-Brookman, 45, was initially suspended in mid-February, but was fired from “The View” last week, multiple sources confirmed.      One show insider said: “During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, ‘If you have something to say, say it to my face!’ So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match. Jennifer was loud, and profoundly and publicly disrespectful to Rosie.”      The source continued, “You have to be mindful of your role and the pecking order. Producers cannot be publicly disrespectful to the talent, no matter how much you disagree. You have to know your place. It was so shocking, Rosie and other members of staff told the HR department about Jennifer’s behavior — she was suspended and then she was fired.”      Other sources say the internal investigation into the on-set skirmish reported its findings all the way up to Ben Sherwood, now the president of Disney/ABC Television Group.      The daytime drama took place just before O’Donnell announced she was leaving “The View” to take care of her kids amid her divorce from wife Michelle Rounds, and to focus on her health. Her farewell show was on Feb. 12.      Cindi Berger, spokeswoman for O’Donnell, said, “There are so many behind-the-scenes stories at ‘The View,’ this is yet another.” A rep for the program sniffed, “We don’t comment on rumor, speculation or gossip.” Brookman didn’t get back to us. ||||| Rosie O’Donnell is a total bully who intimidated staff when she was co-host of ABC’s “The View” — and even got a producer fired for suspected media leaks, a new lawsuit charges.      O’Donnell targeted senior producer Jennifer Shepard-Brookman for shifting coverage of the ISIS beheading of US journalist James Foley to co-host Whoopi Goldberg, according to Brookman’s defamation suit filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court.      During the September 2014 incident, O’Donnell went on a tirade while getting right in Shepard-Brookman’s face, the suit says.      “My client started crying. She was scared of Rosie and thought she was going to be assaulted,” said Shepard-Brookman’s attorney, Brian Kennedy.      O’Donnell also got Shepard-Brookman fired out of spite, the suit alleges.      O’Donnell’s lawyer, Nicolle Jacoby, called the claims “baseless.” ||||| Rosie O’Donnell and her ex, Michelle Rounds, were in court on Wednesday to determine custody of their 2-year-old daughter, Dakota. When the hearing was over, the former couple left with an agreement for joint custody.      Outside the courtroom, ET caught up with Rounds’ attorney, who said that his client was happy with the agreement, while O'Donnell joked to reporters that, \\"There's peace in the Middle East.\\"      \\"It's done,\\" the 53-year-old TV personality said in a statement to ET. \\"We’ve settled. We’re both very happy about the outcome.\\"      Rounds spoke to ET earlier this year about the custody battle, saying that she would \\"walk away' from the couple’s prenuptial agreement if O’Donnell, who filed for divorce in February, would give her full custody of their daughter.      \\"I made my first million before the age of 39, that was before I met Rosie. I don't need Rosie's money,\\" Rounds, a former IT consultant, said at the time. \\"I don't want Rosie's money. Nothing was in my name. The prenup money means nothing to me.\\"      Rounds stressed that, in seeking full custody, she was looking to provide a \\"healthier\\" and \\"way more protective\\" environment for her daughter. The couple adopted Dakota as an infant in January 2013, after marrying in June 2012.      \\"I just want my child to have the best possible environment to grow up in, a normal life,” Rounds told ET. “Right now she's got 24/7 nannies over there at Rosie's house. I don't want my child to have a 24/7 nanny.\\"      \\"[Rosie] leaves the baby overnight with nannies,\\" O’Donnell’s ex also alleged. \\"She has the monitor in the nanny's room.\\"      Rounds added that the couple’s parenting style was a major source of conflict in their marriage. ||||| Jennifer Shepard-Brookman says the former 'View' host told producers she leaked negative stories to the media.      A former senior producer of The View has sued Rosie O’Donnell, claiming the former co-host of the ABC daytime program got her fired by slandering her in front of the show's other producers and staff.      Jennifer Shepard-Brookman claimed she was fired in 2015 after having worked on The View since 2001.      Her complaint, filed Thursday in New York state court, states that O’Donnell resented long-standing moderator Whoopi Goldberg and wanted to unseat her from the moderator spot.      Shepard-Brookman claimed O'Donnell \\"accused Ms. Brookman of teaming with Ms. Goldberg to undermine Ms. O'Donnell.\\" For instance, Shepard-Brookman said O'Donnell thought she conspired to shift the coverage of the Islamic State group's beheading of journalist James Foley from O’Donnell to Goldberg.      \\"At that time, Ms. O'Donnell intimidated Ms. Brookman by screaming that she 'owned' the story and was upset that Ms. Goldberg covered the story, and by grabbing the arms of the chair in which Ms. Brookman was sitting, leaning very close to her face and prohibiting her from leaving,\\" states the complaint.      In the year following O’Donnell’s return to The View, Shepard-Brookman said, \\"Numerous stories appeared in the media\\" about O'Donnell's \\"acrimonious\\" relationship with the producers, other hosts and staff. (O'Donnell left the show in February citing personal reasons.)      The complaint states that O'Donnell \\"publicly accused Ms. Brookman of betraying professional and personal confidences and leaking certain sensitive information to the media\\" in a meeting in January with producers including View executive producer Bill Wolff (who himself left in August). O'Donnell continued to spread the false accusations after the meeting, said Shepard-Brookman.      \\"To be clear, Ms. Brookman denies that she ever leaked any such information about the show to the media,\\" states the complaint.      Her complaint only states one cause of action, slander per se, which she says \\"caused [her] to suffer intense emotional distress … destroyed her professional reputation and led to her termination of employment.\\" Shepard-Brookman seeks unspecified damages.      She's represented by New York's Brian Kennedy and Singer Deutsch.      \\"The allegations that have been made by Jennifer Brookman against Rosie O'Donnell are baseless, and Ms. O'Donnell will defend herself vigorously in court,\\" O'Donnell's attorney, Nicolle Jacoby, tells The Hollywood Reporter.      \\"Page Six\\" first reported the lawsuit. |||||","output":"Jennifer Shepard-Brookman, a senior producer on \\"The View\\" who has worked with the ABC daytime show for over eight years, was fired after being \\"profoundly and publicly disrespectful\\" to Rosie O'Donnell, former host of the show, in front of the entire staff during a production meeting in early February.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984.

The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then.  - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.  - Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of the International Swimming Federation (FINA), in which competitors are subject to only limited restrictions on their swimming stroke, affording the swimmer great freedom in style. Freestyle races are the most common of all swimming competitions, with distances reaching 1500m (1650 yards). The stroke used almost universally in freestyle races is the front crawl, as this style is generally the fastest. For this reason, the term \\"freestyle\\" is sometimes incorrectly used as a synonym for \\"front crawl\\" when in fact it means one is mostly free to choose a style.  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - The Commonwealth of Nations (formerly the British Commonwealth), also known as simply The Commonwealth, is an intergovernmental organisation of 52 member states that were mostly territories of the former British Empire.

Answer the following question: Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Given a choice of categories company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, the text refers to which one? The answer to this question is:","output":"The text refers to the category of \\"plant.\\" In specific, Eureiandra balfourii is a species of plant in the Cucurbitaceae family, which is endemic to Yemen and found in subtropical or tropical dry forests. The Cucurbitaceae family, also known as the gourd family, consists of about 975 species in around 98 genera. Some well-known plants belonging to this family include cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash. Eureiandra balfourii's natural habitat represents the ecological environment where it is commonly found, which is in subtropical or tropical dry forests. These dry forests are characterized by a seasonal climate with a lengthy dry season and a short wet season. The flora and fauna in these regions have adapted to withstand periods of limited water availability. Such adaptations in plants may include deep root systems that can access water deep in the soil, the ability to store water in various plant tissues, or physiological mechanisms for water conservation. Endemism, in the context of the plant species Eureiandra balfourii, means that the plant is native only to a specific geographic region—in this case, Yemen. Often, endemic species are the result of long-term isolation that enabled unique evolutionary development in a particular area, ultimately becoming distinguishable from other species in the same family or genus. Due to their limited range, endemic species can be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss, climate change, and human interference. As a result, their conservation becomes a critical concern for maintaining botanical and ecosystem diversity. In summary, the text refers to Eureiandra balfourii, a plant species belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. This species is endemic to Yemen, growing in subtropical or tropical dry forests unique to that region. The categorization of Eureiandra balfourii falls under the category of \\"plant,\\" shedding light on its characteristics, native habitat, and ecological implications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Moon and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Moon. This astronomical event can only happen during a Full Moon when the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned. The rarity of this specific lunar eclipse is due to its length, making it a special event for stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts in Maryland and other regions with clear visibility. In this instance, the topic falls under the Science/Tech category because it involves celestial bodies, astronomical phenomena, and the observation of such events. It is important to note that the occurrence of lunar eclipses and understanding, forecasting, and observing them is a scientific practice conducted by experts in the field of astronomy. Lunar eclipses can be total, partial, or penumbral, depending on the extent to which the Earth's shadow covers the Moon. During total lunar eclipses, the Moon may appear reddish due to the Earth's atmosphere filtering sunlight and only allowing certain wavelengths to reach the Moon. This phenomenon is called Rayleigh scattering and is the same reason why sunrises and sunsets have a reddish hue. Lunar eclipses are significant for scientific research, as they provide opportunities for astronomers to study the Earth's atmosphere, the Moon's surface, and other celestial phenomena. Furthermore, the alignment of celestial bodies during a lunar eclipse allows researchers to analyze the dynamics of our solar system more accurately. In conclusion, the rarity of this particular lunar eclipse and its unusual length are of particular interest in the Science/Tech field. It presents an opportunity for astronomers, researchers, and enthusiasts to witness a fascinating celestial event while gaining valuable knowledge about the functioning of our solar system, the Earth's atmosphere, and the Moon's surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Feeling too ill to sit in class, Baker had sought refuge in the office of her father, then the head of the lower school at Forsyth Country Day, where she was a student. “This is so bad, one of the worst stories ever,” she said. “I was on his email and an email popped up from my pediatrician saying the diagnosis.” Her parents, Norris and Kimberley, sat down with her that night to discuss the disease. By then, she had typed “Crohn’s” into an internet search and had read what she called “horrible stories” about people having to have their intestines cut out. “It was the worst feeling in the world,” she said, pausing to wipe away tears. “I love swimming more than anything in the entire world, and I thought my swimming career was over.” The next year was a blur of doctors’ offices and medical tests and illnesses, including whooping cough and a broken rib sustained during a violent coughing episode. The first Crohn’s treatment she was put on involved a daily regimen of more than a dozen pills, but it was ineffective. Eighth grade was a nightmare, Baker said. Already thin, she lost more than 10 pounds, prompting her mother to feed her a cheeseburger and a 500-calorie piece of cheesecake each night to try to keep her weight up. “For years afterward,” Baker said, “I could not eat those foods because I hated them so much.” When people at school or at swimming commented on her weight loss, Baker told them she was dealing with stomach problems. “I didn’t want to be known as that sick kid,” she said. Her health began to stabilize after her treatment was changed to incorporate monthly intravenous infusions that consumed most of two days, including one for recovery. But after a few years, the infusions ceased to be effective, and Baker began a regimen she continues to follow that includes giving herself biweekly injections in the abdomen. As Baker sought to manage the disease, training through bouts of stomach cramps, nausea and diarrhea, her parents and older sister, Rachel, strained under the weight of her struggles. Kimberley Baker sometimes excused herself to take a shower just so she could release the tears that she held back in her daughter’s presence. Rachel, who swims at Washington & Lee University, struggled to understand why the disease had targeted her sister and not her. “Of course, I’ve thought ‘why not me?’” Baker’s sister wrote in an email. “It’s hard to watch someone you love suffer, but especially in this case, since we’re close in age, do the same sport, and she was so good while I was never going to go to the Olympics. So it seemed like I should be the sick one, not her.” Baker’s determination sometimes makes her a difficult patient. It was with great reluctance that she agreed to limit her training to one pool practice a day. Her parents, doctors and coaches have all grown exasperated trying to persuade her to back off during training, or to forgo it altogether, when she is experiencing Crohn’s flare-ups. “It was always very challenging to get Kathleen not to swim,” said Dr. Clifford, her pediatrician. “It felt like punishment to her.” Despite spending, as Baker described it, “a lot of high school and my childhood in doctors’ offices,” she steadily climbed the competitive ladder. She won four medals at the 2013 world junior championships and finished second in the 200-meter backstroke at the senior nationals the next summer. That qualified her for the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships and the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, Russia. In March, as a freshman at the University of California, Baker placed second in the 200-yard individual medley at the N.C.A.A. Division I championships but struggled to manage the cumulative stress from the Pacific-12 Conference championships and the N.C.A.A. meet. As a result, she chose to skip the 200 backstroke at the trials and concentrate on the 100. The eight-contestant field in the final included the 2012 Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin and Natalie Coughlin, a former world-record holder in the event. Baker set a personal best of 59.29 seconds to finish 27-hundredths of a second behind the winner, Olivia Smoliga. When Dr. Kappelman, in North Carolina, found out that Baker had made the Olympic team, he said he called his wife and his parents and then stepped outside his office and announced the news “as if an amazing thing had happened to my own child.” Baker’s experience on other international trips has made her adept at filling out the medical forms required by the World Anti-Doping Agency and packing her medical kit, including syringes and extra dosages of her medicine in case of emergency. The super bacteria in the waters off Rio do not worry her; Baker knows from gastrointestinal disorders. “There’ve been times where I’ve said, ‘There’s no way I’m going to go on an international team,’ but somehow it’s worked out,” said Baker, who reported this week to a pre-Olympic training camp in San Antonio. “I’ve gotten healthy enough to swim well.” Well enough to grace the biggest international stage in sports. “What this means to me,” Baker said, tearing up again, “is on a whole ’nother level.” A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2016, on page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Crohn’s Disease Fails to Stop U.S. Olympian. Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What was this article about?","output":"This article is about the inspirational story of a young swimmer named Kathleen Baker, who overcame Crohn's Disease to become an Olympian.

She achieved numerous accomplishments, such as winning medals at competitions and even securing her place at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

A former Arab League observer in Syria has decried the organisation's monitoring mission to the country as a \\"farce\\", as the UN Security Council heard security forces had stepped up the killing of protesters after the observers' arrival.      Anwar Malek, an Algerian member of the monitoring team, told Al Jazeera he resigned because of what he saw, and said that the mission was falling apart.      \\"What I saw was a humanitarian disaster. The regime is not just committing one war crime, but a series of crimes against its people,\\" he said.      \\"The snipers are everywhere shooting at civilians. People are being kidnapped. Prisoners are being tortured and none were released.\\"      He said that security forces did not withdraw their tanks from the streets, but just hid them and then redeployed them after the observers left.      Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has addressed a large gathering of his supporters in the Syrian capital, Damascus.      Assad, in his second speech in as many days, reiterated his accusations that the \\"homeland was reeling under the brunt of conspiracy\\".      The president also said: \\"We will triumph over this conspiracy. It is dying; it’s end of their plot.\\"      In a speech on Tuesday, his first public address since June, the Syrian President made some promises of reform, but no sweeping concessions that might placate an opposition determined to end more than four decades of domination by the Assad family.      French journalist killed      In the central city of Homs, a French journalist was among several people killed on Wednesday, becoming the first Western reporter to have died in 10 months of unrest in the country.      French journalist Gilles Jacquier is the first Western reporter to have died in Syria since the uprising bagan [Reuters]      Syria's state-sponsored Addounia TV, which gave a total death toll of eight, said a Dutch journalist was among 25 people wounded.      France 2 television confirmed its journalists had been killed.      \\"France 2 television has just learned with a great deal of sorrow the death of reporter Gilles Jacquier in Homs,\\" the channel said in a statement, adding it did not have details of the circumstances of his death.      According to an AFP news agency reporter at the scene, a shell exploded amid a group of journalists covering demonstrations in the city.      The United Nations has said more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since protests against Assad began last March. Assad says \\"terrorists\\" have killed 2,000 members of his security forces.      Killing 'accelerated'      A senior UN official told the Security Council on Tuesday that Syria had accelerated its killing of pro-democracy demonstrators after Arab League monitors arrived, according to Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations.      \\"The under-secretary-general noted that in the days since the Arab League monitoring mission has been on the ground, an estimated 400 additional people have been killed, an average of 40 a day, a rate much higher than was the case before their deployment,\\" Rice said.      Rice was speaking after Lynn Pascoe, UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, briefed the 15-nation Security Council behind closed doors on Syria and other major crises.      \\"That is a clear indication that the government of Syria, rather than using the opportunity ... to end the violence and fulfil all of its commitments [to the Arab League], is instead stepping up the violence,\\" Rice said.      Assad made scathing remarks about the Arab League, which suspended Syria in November and whose monitors are trying to check Syria's compliance with an Arab peace plan.      \\"The Arab League has failed for six decades to take a position in the Arab interest,\\" he said.      Attacks condemned      The League condemned an attack on Monday in which 11 of its monitors were hurt by demonstrators in the port city of Latakia, saying Syria had breached its obligation to protect them.      Syria said it was continuing to provide security for the observers and condemned any act that obstructed their work.            Patrick Seale, author of several books on Syria, discusses Assad's speech on Tuesday      But Malek told Al Jazeera that the government was not assisting observers with their requests.      \\"The regime didn't meet any of our requests, in fact they were trying to deceive us and steer us away from what was really happening, towards insignificant things.\\"      He said that those who were supposedly freed and were shown on TV, were actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the street.      \\"They were detained for four or five days in tough conditions and later released as if they had been real prisoners.\\"      Malek also said that he had seen snipers on top of buildings: \\"On one, there were even army officers in front of the building, while snipers were on the roof.      \\"Some on our team preferred to maintain good relations with the regime and denied that there were snipers.\\"      He said that Assad's government \\"has gained a lot of time that has helped it implement its plan ... Therefore I've decided to withdraw from this mission.\\"      The Arab League has not responded to Al Jazeera's requests for a reaction to Malek's comments. ||||| Anti-government protesters carry the coffin of Muhammad Khaled Al-Kaheel, who protesters say was killed in earlier clashes with government troops, during his funeral in Qudsaya near Damascus January 9, 2012.      CAIRO (Reuters) - An Arab observer delegation in Syria is running into further difficulties, with two members either quitting or threatening to do so within 24 hours because their mission is proving ineffectual in ending the suffering of civilians.      An observer who declined to give his name said on Wednesday he was ready to walk out, exposing rifts in an Arab peace effort a day after Anwar Malek, an Algerian observer, told Al Jazeera TV he had quit Syria because the peace mission was a \\"farce.\\"      Both men, clearly appalled by what they had seen, spoke of continued violence, killings and torture, saying the bloodshed had not abated as a result of the presence of the Arab League mission. Both described Syrians' suffering as \\"unimaginable.\\"      Malek's departure was a blow to the mission, already criticized by Syria's opposition as a toothless body that only served to buy President Bashar al-Assad time.      Its work has already been hampered by an attack on monitors in the western port of Latakia this week that lightly wounded 11 and prompted the League to delay sending new observers to Syria to join about 165 already there.      Another resignation would further undermine its credibility.      Asked if he agreed with Malek's characterization of the mission as a failure, the monitor said: \\"It is true, it is true. Even I am trying to leave on Friday. I'm going to Cairo or elsewhere... because the mission is unclear.... It does not serve the citizens. It does not serve anything.\\"      \\"The Syrian authorities have exploited the weakness in the performance of the delegation to not respond. There is no real response on the ground.\\"      The monitor, speaking by telephone from Syria, asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.      \\"The military gear is still present even in the mosques. We asked that military equipment be withdrawn from the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq mosque in Deraa and until today they have not withdrawn.\\"      The Arab League monitoring mission began work on December 26. Its task is to verify if Syria is complying with an agreement to halt a crackdown on 10 months of protests against Assad in which the United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed.      OPPOSITION ALARMED      A U.N. official told the Security Council on Tuesday that Syria had accelerated its killing of protesters after the Arab monitors had arrived.      Assad mocked the Arab League in a speech in which he said that it had failed for six decades to promised to take a position in Arab interests. He said he would strike down a revolt he slammed as foreign plot.      The choice of a Sudanese general to head the mission had already alarmed opposition activists who say Sudan's own defiance of a war crimes tribunal means the monitors probably will not recommend strong action against Assad.      The unnamed monitor said the Syrian authorities had shown little genuine willingness to comply with the plan while the observers lacked the expertise to do their mission justice.      \\"There is oppression. There is strong oppression and there is suffering, a lot of suffering, more than you imagine,\\" he said, describing one part of the central city of Homs he had visited.      \\"This is a very big problem and it is related firstly to the general will of the Syrian authorities to cooperate with the delegation in a genuine manner and without maneuvering,\\" he said.      \\"Secondly, it is related to the expertise of the delegation... It needs experts in the fields of monitoring, of diplomacy, of international law.\\"      While an Arab League meeting on Syria said on Sunday it remained committed to the mission, the observer said that individual monitors were thinking of quitting, either fearing for their lives or frustrated at failing to make a difference.      Malek said Syrian authorities had not withdrawn their tanks from the streets, but had simply hidden them.      \\"The snipers are everywhere shooting at civilians. People are being kidnapped. Prisoners are being tortured and no one has been released,\\" the Algerian former observer said on Al Jazeera. \\"Those who are supposedly freed and shown on TV are actually people who had been randomly grabbed off the streets.\\"      Earlier, a posting by Malek on Facebook was taken down, but his words were quoted on the page of Adib Shishakly, a member of the opposition Syrian National Council.      \\"Bloodshed in Syria hasn't stopped,\\" Malek reportedly said. \\"Every day, we see bodies in conditions that are unimaginable. Violence is increasing and we are unable to do anything for the victims of snipers, bombardments and assassinations.      \\"Kidnapping continues, and torture has exceeded all boundaries. Syria is headed towards destruction and civil war.\\"      He said the monitors were \\"ruled by restrictions imposed by their governments,\\" but did not go into details.      \\"I am now clearing my conscience to the heroic people of Syria... The truth is gone and the right path is gone. And the sun of the Arabs has set in the alleyways of sad Syria.\\"      U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the League monitoring mission in Syria could not continue indefinitely.      Adnan Khodeir, head of the League's monitoring operations room, said the observers could resume work on Thursday after not going out for two days following the Latakia attack. \\"All the monitors are well, and there are no problems,\\" he said.      PROMISES NOT MET      Under the Arab peace plan, Syrian authorities were supposed to stop attacking peaceful protests, withdraw troops and tanks from the streets, free detainees and open a political dialogue.      The unnamed monitor said those promises had not been met, with the Syrian military still present in cities, even in residential areas, while it was difficult to verify, for instance, if political prisoners had genuinely been released.      \\"There are lots of detainees who are not detained officially. Are they with air force security? Are they with military security? Are they with political security?\\" he said.      Malek accused Syria of war crimes and torturing prisoners. The Arab League, which suspended Syria in November for failing to halt the crackdown, disputed Malek's account, saying illness had stopped him carrying out his work.      The unnamed monitor said Malek may have had contacts with Syrian opposition members, but they had visited Homs together.      Monitors had been allowed to visit any area they chose, but Syrian authorities had refused to accompany them in particularly tense neighborhoods, forcing them to make a decision to either stay away or take the risk of going in alone, the monitor said.      He arrived in Syria on December 27 and has visited Homs, Damascus and Deraa. The Bab Amr area of Homs was in a particularly dire way, he said.      Syria has barred most independent media, making it difficult to verify conflicting accounts of events on the ground.      The country says it is facing a wave of terrorism by Islamists and conspirators who are armed and manipulated from abroad and have killed 2,000 members of the security forces.      But the monitor said he had seen no evidence of this.      \\"We did not feel afraid or threatened while talking to them. In all the areas we went to, we did not meet any gunmen, unless they had hidden their guns,\\" he said. \\"What we found were citizens in their homes who spoke of their suffering.\\"      (Additional reporting by Ayman Samir in Cairo and Alistair Lyon and Dominic Evans in Beirut.

A spokesman for the Nigerian military said the attack failed. Acting President Goodluck Jonathan was approved for the role Tuesday. Article:","output":"Title: Joint Revolutionary Council Claims Pipeline Attack in Niger Delta; Nigerian Military Disputes Success The Joint Revolutionary Council (JRC), a militant group in the Niger Delta, has claimed responsibility for an attack on a pipeline in the region. In a statement released by the JRC, they announced that one of their units had attacked and \\"exploded\\" the Tura manifold, a crucial component in the pipeline system. However, a spokesman for the Nigerian military has disputed the success of the attack, claiming that it had ultimately failed. The JRC, known for its activities in the Niger Delta region, often carries out such attacks on pipelines and oil infrastructure, which they see as symbols of injustice and exploitation by the Nigerian government and foreign oil corporations. Through these attacks, the JRC aims to disrupt the functioning of the oil industry and bring attention to the plight of the people in the Niger Delta, who have long suffered from the environmental and social consequences of oil exploration and production. Despite the JRC's claims, the Nigerian military has attempted to downplay the impact of the attack, asserting that the explosion at the Tura manifold was unsuccessful. The military's statement on the matter seeks to reassure both domestic and international stakeholders that the security situation remains under control in the oil-rich region, even as reports of increasing militant activities continue to surface. The attack comes as Nigeria's Acting President, Goodluck Jonathan, was approved for the role on Tuesday. As the leader of Nigeria, Jonathan will need to address the ongoing unrest in the Niger Delta and find ways to balance the competing interests of the various stakeholders, such as the local residents, the Nigerian government, and the international oil companies operating in the country. In conclusion, while the JRC has claimed responsibility for the pipeline attack and boasted about the destruction of the Tura manifold, the Nigerian military contends that the attack was unsuccessful. Regardless of the outcome, this incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing instability and unrest in the Niger Delta, a situation that will undoubtedly require the attention and action of the newly appointed Acting President, Goodluck Jonathan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, before doing anything else, they took a few moments to look around carefully so they wouldn't bump into anything or trip and fall. They noticed there were small round tables and chairs scattered around the room, and in the middle of the bar, there was a long counter where a man was standing behind it. This man was the bartender - kind of like a waiter, but he served drinks instead of food.

Solve 205*n - 4653 = -25358 for n.","output":"The math problem to solve here is an algebraic equation with one unknown variable, n. To find the value of n that makes this equation true, we will isolate the variable n by performing some mathematical operations, as follows: 205 * n - 4653 = -25358 First, let's move the constant term (-4653) to the right side of the equation. This can be done by adding 4653 to both sides of the equation: 205 * n - 4653 + 4653 = -25358 + 4653 205 * n = -20695 Now we have an equation of the form 205 * n = -20695. To isolate the variable n, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is 205: (205 * n) / 205 = -20695 / 205 n = -101 Thus, the solution to the math problem 205 * n - 4653 = -25358 for n is n = -101."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role.

Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little.

Information:  - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas.  - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Classical Armenian (\\"grabar\\", Western Armenian \\"krapar\\", meaning \\"literary [language]\\"; also Old Armenian or Liturgical Armenian) is the oldest attested form of the Armenian language. It was first written down at the beginning of the 5th century, and all Armenian literature from then through the 18th century is in Classical Armenian. Many ancient manuscripts originally written in Ancient Greek, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac and Latin survive only in Armenian translation.  - Movses Kaghankatvatsi ( Armenian :   Movses Kaankatvaci ) , or Movses Daskhurantsi (   Movses Dasxuranci ) is the reputed author ( or authors ) of a tenth - century Classical Armenian historiographical work on Caucasian Albania and eastern provinces of Armenia , known as The History of the Country of Albania (   , Patmutiwn Auanic ) .  - Western Armenian (Classical spelling: , \\"arevmdahayerên\\") is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Eastern Armenian. Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the Armenian diaspora communities around the world. As a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian at less than one million.  - Albania (Latin: ', Greek: , in Old Armenian:  \\"Auank\\" (\\"Aguank\\"), Parthian: \\"Ardhan\\", Middle Persian: \\"Arran\\"); usually referred to as Caucasian Albania\\"' for disambiguation with the modern state of Albania (the native name for the country is unknown), is a name for the historical region of the eastern Caucasus, that existed on the territory of present-day republic of Azerbaijan (where both of its capitals were located) and partially southern Dagestan. Around the first centuries BC and AD the land south of the Greater Caucasus and north of the Lesser Caucasus was divided between Kolchis in the west, Caucasian Iberia in the center and Caucasian Albania in the east. To the southwest was Armenia and to the southeast Atropatene.  - The Armenian language (\\"\\") is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora. Armenian has its own unique script, the Armenian alphabet, introduced in 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots.  - Albania (; ), officially the Republic of Albania, is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe. It has a population of 3.03 million as of 2016. Tirana is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Durrës and Vlorë. Albania is located in the south-western part of the Balkan peninsula, bordered by Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, the Republic of Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south and southeast. The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.

Summarize this article: Photos from a homeless advocate show the injuries of George Grayson, 37, one of many St. Petersburg homeless men who said they were paid 25 to 50 to be beaten by women for a fetish site. A lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction to stop the beatings, saying the men were vulnerable and desperate for money.      ST. PETERSBURG — It sounded like a good idea to George Grayson: Get 50 for submitting to a 12-minute videotaped beating by an attractive female.      A homeless man, Grayson needed the money.      So he followed the recruiters to a St. Petersburg townhouse on seven different occasions over the last few months, he said, and let five different women use his body and face as a punching bag.      Grayson, 37, became one of many St. Petersburg homeless men allegedly targeted by recruiters from Shefights.net, a locally operated website that sells for as much as 900 videos of scantily clad or semi-nude women beating up men, according to a lawsuit.      \\"I'm still in a little bit of pain from a couple of weeks ago,\\" Grayson said last week. \\"I'm just trying to deal with it mentally right now.\\"      Local homeless advocate G.W. Rolle said for months he noticed men walking around Williams Park with black eyes, split lips and limps before he finally got someone to tell him about the \\"beatdowns,\\" as they have come to be known among the homeless.      He began interviewing and photographing several men with similar stories and injuries, and attorneys representing two of the men have filed a lawsuit against Jeff Williams of Shefights.net, J.P. Florida Productions, \\"Cindy Doe\\" and \\"Jane Does 1-5.\\"      Southern Legal Counsel, which has represented St. Petersburg's homeless in the past, filed the suit seeking an injunction to stop the beatings, saying the men were vulnerable and desperate for money. It also seeks damages for medical costs and emotional distress.      \\"I was shocked when I found out what was really going on,\\" Rolle said. \\"It's incredible what people will do to each other.\\"      Williams, of Shefights.net, said Rolle coaxed and bought the testimony of Grayson and 20-year-old Kyle Shaw, the two plaintiffs in the suit. He said he plans to countersue, claiming the men and their advocates lied and have damaged his reputation.      \\"These men are crack addicts and will say anything for money,\\" Williams said.      He said Grayson and Shaw were featured in some of the videos, but he said they signed liability releases and knew what they were doing.      \\"They've come back many times, which makes it pretty consensual,\\" Williams said. Citing the case, he declined to speak about the videos or other specifics.      The homepage of the Shefight.net site features women in sports bras punching or kneeing doubled-over men. It reads, \\"We offer semi-competitive and competitive wrestling, MMA, and kickboxing sessions, as well as beatdowns (which we really love!). We also make custom videos to your specifications. We are located in Saint Petersburg, FL.\\"      Previews of the videos describe scenarios such as, \\"This is the second part of Julie's domination beatdown of Army Guy. In this final part, she whips her biggest admirer with a crop, tramples him, puts him in bondage, spits on him, and totally humiliates and dominates him while also displaying her usual array of kicks and punches. This is a Julie very few have seen before.\\"      In some of the featured clips, the women are topless. The site offers custom videos, made for the buyer's specifications, starting at 600.      Rolle digitally recorded hours of homeless men describing similar experiences of being recruited on the street and taken to a townhouse on First Avenue S between 16th and 17th streets. Some described the beatings happening in a garage, some say they were beaten in a back yard in front of spectators.      The men say they were offered 25 to be whipped and 50 to be beaten by the women. They were not allowed to fight back, they say, and did not get paid if they quit before the 12 minutes expired.      The lawsuit filed against Shefights.net alleges that Shaw suffered broken ribs, a dislocated jaw, back injuries and a dislocated arm on two different visits to 73 16th St. S. Grayson, the suit says, sustained bruises and multiple lacerations.      Jail records show Shaw in the past has been charged with theft, criminal mischief and simple battery. Grayson has been charged with burglary, robbery and dealing in stolen property.      Williams, 58, of Shefights.net, has no criminal record.      Many homeless people have criminal records, Rolle said. But they also have mental disorders and health problems, which is why they should not be beaten in a garage with no regulation or medical supervision, he said.      The two men listed in the suit are too easily coaxed into doing the wrong thing, he said.      Grayson has autistic tendencies and has a hard time following logic, he said, and Shaw has an extremely low IQ.      Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report.

PETERSBURG — A local website hawking videos of half-naked women pummeling homeless men has caught the attention of St. Petersburg police.      Police say they are investigating Shefights.net to see if those arranging, filming and selling the fights — and paying the homeless to be assaulted — are doing anything illegal.      \\"Anything involving bodily harm to someone invites scrutiny to see if any laws have been broken,\\" said police spokesman Mike Puetz. The investigation has been going on for months.      The St. Petersburg Times on Tuesday published a story about a lawsuit that has been filed against Shefights.net. The Southern Legal Counsel filed the suit on behalf of two homeless men who appeared in videos.      The suit alleges that the organizers recruited and paid homeless men to be tied and beaten on camera by women dressed in skimpy athletic tops and bottoms — or in the more expensive videos, even less clothing than that.      The men said they were paid 25 to be whipped and 50 to be beaten. They could not fight back and had to sign releases, they said. The suit seeks damages and a court order to stop the fights.      Neil Chonin, director of litigation for the Southern Legal Counsel, said the website is another in a series of setbacks suffered by the city's homeless. In 2007, the city came under fire for slashing homeless tents. Last year the City Council banned panhandling on street corners.      \\"All around the county, but particularly in St. Petersburg, they get trespassed, they get their property taken — in my mind, it's a further extension of how homeless people are being exploited,\\" Chonin said. \\"Nobody cares about them.      According to the suit, 20-year-old Kyle Shaw was homeless when he agreed in January to let a woman beat him for 12 minutes for 50. He did it again in February. Both times, he said, his hands were bound. Shaw said he suffered broken ribs, a dislocated arm and a dislocated jaw. He said he didn't know the video of his assault would be sold online and in one case he wasn't even paid.      Another homeless man, 37-year-old George Grayson, alleged in the suit that he was offered the same deal: 12 minutes of violence for 50. Grayson, who has Asperger's syndrome, said he was desperate for money.      Homeless advocates fear the website is exploiting the most vulnerable — mentally, physically and economically.      \\"(They've) found people who were so vulnerable that the act of making this decision was compromised by a disability,\\" said National Coalition for the Homeless executive director Neil Donovan. \\"That's pretty sick.\\"      The civil suit was filed against Jeff Williams of Shefights.net, J.P. Florida Productions, \\"Cindy Doe\\" and \\"Jane Does 1-5.\\" Williams told the Times that he plans to countersue. A message on Shefights.net said media accounts of the website are inaccurate.      \\"We won't be intimidated,\\" the message said, \\"and these allegations against us will be disproved.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"A lawsuit has been filed against Shefights.net, a fetish website that allegedly paid homeless men in St. Petersburg, Florida, between 25 to 50 to be beaten by women.

When baking, by what primary means does the heat reach the food? Convection, conduction, or radiation?","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the primary means of heat transfer in baking: convection, conduction, and radiation, and analyze which one is most prevalent. 1. Convection: This heat transfer method occurs when a fluid (in this case, air) moves around and carries thermal energy from the heat source to the food. In baking, hot air circulates around the food, and this plays a significant role in the cooking process, especially in convection ovens. 2. Conduction: This involves heat transfer through direct contact. In baking, conduction happens when the heat from the hot surface of the baking pan, for example, is transferred to the food touching it. 3. Radiation: This heat transfer occurs through electromagnetic waves, primarily infrared radiation. In baking, the food absorbs radiant heat from the oven's walls and heating elements. After considering these methods, it's clear that the primary means of heat transfer in baking is convection. Convection allows the heat to be distributed more evenly and efficiently, leading to faster and more uniform cooking. Moreover, in convection ovens, the presence of a fan helps to circulate the hot air around the food, further enhancing the convection process. Conduction and radiation also play a role, but convection is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in baking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rococo, ornate, property of a shipping tycoon whose wife has admitted, after 30 years of marriage, that she's always hated it. Bidding starts at £400... it's sold for £2,200 to the man decorating apartments for wealthy Chinese clients. When the well-heeled residents of Chelsea feel the urge to declutter last season's conspicuous consumption, Lots Road Auctions is where they sell off their old stuff. Customer Lili Tarkow-Reinisch, with one of the lots from Chelsea's infamous auction house. Every Sunday afternoon there are bargains galore, whether you fall for the fibre-optic polar bear or a bookcase with zebra-skin lining. Now a new Channel 4 series takes viewers behind the scenes, meeting the auctioneers who would sell their own grandmother - and the customers so desperate for a bargain they'd probably buy her. Every week, valuer Andrew Mackay gets on his push-bike to visit some of west London's wealthiest homes. One lady had paid £30,000 for two corner sofas, he recalls. Andrew Mackay heading off to do a valuation. She got bored with them after six months, put them into storage costing £1,000 a month for three years - by which time they'd cost her £66,000 - and was delighted when they fetched £1,500 each at auction. 'We're lucky here because the vendors aren't selling because they're skint. We get lots of celebrities... They don't want to sell on eBay or have strangers coming to their house - this is a lot more anonymous.' Andrew points to a nondescript leather armchair and footstool. It turns out it's Ralph Lauren, cost £6,000 on Bond Street and now has an estimate of £800-£1,200. You wouldn't look at it twice. 'When there's no chiselled sales assistant, it loses its glitter,' he laughs. It finally goes for £2,000. But not every thing sells. A set of bar stools upholstered in whale skin, originally from Aristotle Onassis's yacht Christina, had to be withdrawn from sale for legal reasons. 'The owner didn't want them back, so we just got rid of them.' Some people are addicted to auctions, such as friends Lili Tarkow-Reinisch and Sam Edge, who are trying to furnish Lili's new seven-bedroom Georgian mansion.

'It's no good looking for anything specific; something has to catch your eye.' Sam's tip is to turn up on Monday after the auction, when you can sometimes make a 'cheeky offer' for lots that haven't sold. 'I got a pair of fantastic chandeliers. They were estimated at £2,000-£3,000; I got them for £750.' Most unsold lots - if they're unclaimed - go to a charity furniture shop in Watford. 'They do very well out of us,' says Andrew. 'We gave them a George III bureau the other day. The best buys at the moment are furniture. You can furnish a house with Victorian or Georgian furniture cheaper than Habitat.

Information:  - The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (later known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form the seven-member \\"brotherhood\\". Their principles were shared by other artists, including Marie Spartali Stillman and Ford Madox Brown.  - A priest or priestess (feminine) (from Greek  \\"presbýteros\\" through Latin \\"presbyter\\", \\"elder\\", or from Old High German \\"priast\\", \\"prest\\", from Vulgar Latin \\"provost\\" \\"one put over others\\", from Latin \\"praepositus\\" \\"person placed in charge\\"), is a person authorized to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one or more deities. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also may apply to such persons collectively.  - Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809  19 April 1882) was an English naturalist and geologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.  - A sobriquet is a nickname, sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a pseudonym that is assumed as a disguise, it usually is a familiar name, familiar enough such that it may be used in place of a real name without the need of explanation. This salient characteristic is of sufficient familiarity that the sobriquet may become more familiar than the original name.  - John William Waterhouse (April 6, 1849  February 10, 1917) was an English painter known for working in the Pre-Raphaelite style. He worked several decades after the breakup of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which had seen its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to his sobriquet \\"the modern Pre-Raphaelite\\". Borrowing stylistic influences not only from the earlier Pre-Raphaelites but also from his contemporaries, the Impressionists, his artworks were known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend.  - The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government.   - The Blue Carpet is a piece of Public Art in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, designed by Thomas Heatherwick. Although classified as a piece of public art, it is closer to an urban design feature. The piece occupies a public open space in front of the Laing Art Gallery, close to the main shopping and nightclub areas.   - The Church of England (C of E) is the Anglican Christian state church of England. Headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (currently Justin Welby) and primarily governed from London with the monarch as the supreme governor, the Church of England is also the mother church of the international Anglican Communion. The church dates its formal establishment as a national church to the 6th-century Gregorian mission in Kent led by Augustine of Canterbury, with considerable features introduced and established during and following the English Reformation in the 16th century.  - Charles William Mitchell ( 1854 -- 1903 ) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter from Newcastle . A contemporary of John William Waterhouse , his work is similar in many ways . His one famous piece was Hypatia , shown in 1885 and likely inspired by the Charles Kingsley serialized novel Hypatia or New Foes with an Old Face . This painting is currently in the Laing Art Gallery .  - The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is a department of the United Kingdom government, with responsibility for culture and sport in England, and some aspects of the media throughout the whole UK, such as broadcasting and internet.  - The Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, is located on New Bridge Street. The gallery was designed in the Baroque style with Art Nouveau elements by architects Cackett and Burns Dick and is now a Grade II listed building. It was opened in 1904 and is now managed by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums and sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In front of the gallery is the Blue Carpet.  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - Charles Kingsley (12 June 1819  23 January 1875) was a broad church priest of the Church of England, a university professor, social reformer, historian and novelist. He is particularly associated with Christian socialism, the working men's college, and forming labour cooperatives that failed but led to the working reforms of the progressive era. He was a friend and correspondent with Charles Darwin.  - The Working Men's College (or WMC), is among the earliest adult education institutions established in the United Kingdom, and Europe's oldest extant centre for adult education. Founded by Christian Socialists, at its inception it was at the forefront of liberal education philosophy.  - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - Newcastle upon Tyne, commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East and forms the core of Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities. Newcastle was part of the county of Northumberland until 1400, when it became a county of itself, a status it retained until becoming part of Tyne and Wear in 1974. The regional nickname and dialect for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is Geordie. Newcastle also houses Newcastle University, a member of the Russell Group, as well as Northumbria University.  - Christian socialism is a form of religious socialism based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Many Christian socialists believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in greed, which some Christian denominations consider a mortal sin. Christian socialists identify the cause of inequality to be the greed that they associate with capitalism.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Broad church is a term referring to latitudinarian churchmanship in the Church of England in particular and Anglicanism in general. The term is often used to refer to secular political organisations, meaning that they encompass a broad range of opinion.  - Hypatia (\\"Hupatía\\"; born 35070; died 415), often called Hypatia of Alexandria, was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher in Egypt, then a part of the Byzantine Empire. She was the head of the Neoplatonic school at Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy.  - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.

Here are the choices: - metabolism - enzyme respiration - peristaltic hydrolysis - enzymatic hydrolysis Now, I will examine each choice individually: 1. Metabolism: This is a broad term that refers to the chemical processes that occur within a living organism to maintain life. While metabolism includes processes that release fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids, it is not specific enough for this question. 2. Enzyme respiration: This term is not widely used in the context of releasing fatty acids and other components. Respiration generally refers to the process of exchanging gases, like oxygen and carbon dioxide, in living organisms. 3. Peristaltic hydrolysis: Peristalsis is the process of muscle contractions that help move food through the digestive system. Although peristalsis aids in digestion, it does not directly release fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids. 4. Enzymatic hydrolysis: This is the process through which enzymes break down complex molecules, such as fats and phospholipids, into simpler substances like fatty acids. This choice is the most specific and relevant to the release of fatty acids and other components from fats and phospholipids. Based on the analysis of these choices, the answer to the question is: Answer: Enzymatic hydrolysis"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives.

It is closely related to Slovak and is one of the official languages of the European Union.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory.  They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did Christ seem to have left the world?\\" is \\"After hundreds of years passed, Christ did not return\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the paragraph, the perception that Christ seemed to have left the world was because, after hundreds of years passed, He did not come back as early Christians expected. They believed that He would return during their lifetimes in a short period, and as generations went by without His return, a sadness and melancholy fell upon them. This prolonged absence of Christ resulted in the feeling that He had left the world, and their religion became a sadder one, especially for those who were most holy and longed for His return."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to whats the legal age of consent in california??","output":"In California, the legal age of consent is 18 years old. This means that, in general, individuals who are 18 years old or older are legally allowed to engage in consensual sexual activity with partners who are also at least 18 years old. However, the law is not always straightforward, and there are several components and exceptions within California's complex statutory framework that may apply depending on specific situations. California Penal Code Section 261.5 defines statutory rape as sexual intercourse involving a minor under the age of 18 and an adult who is not more than three years older or three years younger than the minor. Statutory rape is a \\"wobbler\\" offense, which means that it can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony depending on the age difference between the individuals and the circumstances of the case. Here are some key points and legal provisions regarding the age of consent in California: 1. Close-in-age exemption (also known as a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" law): California's age of consent law allows for a close-in-age exemption in cases where the younger individual is at least 16 years old and the older individual is no more than three years older or younger than the minor. In such situations, consensual sexual activity between the two individuals is not considered statutory rape. However, if the age difference is greater than three years, the law may apply, and charges can be filed. 2. Age of consent in same-sex relationships: The age of consent laws in California apply equally to same-sex and opposite-sex relationships. Both heterosexual and homosexual relationships are subject to the same age of consent and statutory rape provisions. 3. Emancipated minors: In some situations, a juvenile under the age of 18 may be legally emancipated, which means they are treated as an adult under certain circumstances. However, emancipation does not affect the age of consent laws. Even if a minor is emancipated, they must still be 18 years old to legally consent to sexual activity in California. 4. Marriage exemption: California law also allows for a marriage exemption to statutory rape charges. If the individuals in question are legally married to each other, they may engage in consensual sexual activity even if one of them is under the age of 18. 5. Mandatory reporting: Under California law, professionals such as doctors, teachers, and therapists who suspect that a minor is involved in underage sexual activity are obligated to report this information to the appropriate authorities. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences for the reporting party. As with any legal matter, it is essential to remember that the age of consent and statutory rape laws are impacted by numerous factors, including the specific facts of a situation and any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. If you have questions or concerns about the age of consent laws in California, it is essential to consult with a knowledgeable attorney who can provide guidance and assistance tailored to your particular situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No snow, everything frozen stiff, grey and uninviting. Show me some nice sunny views! Linda:   Tanya: How wonderful! This being... Linda: The area is called Riviera Maya. It has fantastic beaches, as you can see, but no easily accessible coral reefs. We've done some snorkeling though, just in front of our hotel's beach that has an artificial reef. Not bad at all! Tanya: What the hell is an artificial reef?! Linda: Rows of clay half-round structures, open at the top. After some time they become so overgrown that they nearly look natural. Fish don't seem to mind. Linda:   Linda: Not very best these photos but you can see what I mean. Water temperatures are 24-26 C, so perfect for us to swim. There are also natural coral reefs along the coast here. We can even see them - Arrecife de Puerto Morelos - but they are either nature reserve or you have to be taken there by boat.

Yesterday before sunset I went towards a stretch of wild beaches, no hotels, to pursue my favourite hobby here - collecting seaborne rubbish, and were back to him after half an hour or so, and he was nearly angry with me for leaving him alone. What a bore! Tanya: And your accommodation? It's a fashionable area, isn't it? Linda: The hotel, or rather a resort, Vidanta, is idiotically luxurious. But we are coping! Tanya: Don't make too many sacrifices. Linda:   Tanya: A paradise as artificial as those coral reefs. Linda: Spot on! Being here you just switch off any critical thinking about environment, social justice, all that crap. More food wasted here in one day that people eat in some neighbouring village in a week.

Linda talks about snorkeling in an artificial reef created by clay structures near their hotel's beach. When discussing the area's natural coral reefs, Linda mentions that they are either part of a nature reserve or require a boat trip, which Peter finds expensive.

Now share your opinion. The hard work starts here for Mauricio Pochettino. Firing Tottenham into the Champions League positions next season will be no mean feat. But truth be told, the Argentine has already overcome a sizeable task in becoming Daniel Levy's latest managerial acquisition. The potential appointment of Ajax manager Frank de Boer was the prospect that really got Tottenham supporters' mouths watering. When the Dutchman publicly revealed. Tottenham's interest in him last month, it seemed the start of the road. towards De Boer's appointment. In fact, it was the beginning of the end of his chances of replacing Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane. Dawn of a new era? Mauricio Pochettino has signed a five-year-deal to become Tottenham manager. In the dugout: Pochettino resigned from Southampton on Tuesday to join the White Hart Lane outfit. Second best: Ajax manager Frank de Boer was also in the running for the Tottenham job. Levy insists on private club business staying private, particularly when it concerns something as delicate as a managerial appointment. De Boer's decision to go public with Spurs' interest riled certain figures at White Hart Lane, and, ironically, worked in Pochettino's favour. As Sportsmail revealed, Carlo Ancelotti was always Levy's dream managerial choice. But the chances of luring the Italian away from Real Madrid looked remote at best. Overlooked: De Boer's public talk of the Spurs job, irked the board who wanted it to remain confidential. Decision maker: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has appointed three Tottenham managers since December. With that in mind, Levy made his move for Pochettino. Work towards the South American's appointment has been ongoing behind the scenes for over a fortnight. Fears over Pochettino's grasp of English were soon allayed as Spurs chiefs discovered, despite his decision to use an interpreter for his press duties, that he communicates freely and confidently in English. As a result, he will be expected to conduct his public speaking in English, without the use of an interpreter. But just as Tottenham were laying the groundwork for the arrival of Pochettino, Southampton were just as busy; attempting to keep their highly-rated boss at St Mary's. The offer of a new three-year contract and the promise of a healthy transfer kitty were made, providing Pochettino with somewhat of a dilemma. But in his heart-of-hearts Pochettino's mind was made up; a chance of moving to a club the size of Tottenham does not come around often. Even last week, however, when Pochettino looked nailed on to replace Sherwood, things could easily have turned out differently. It is understood further contact between Tottenham and De Boer took place at the start of last week as decision time loomed for Levy and Co. Deposed: Tim Sherwood was sacked as Spurs boss in May despite signing an 18-month contract in December. Winning smile: Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti was Levy's dream candidate for the Tottenham hotseat. Going into the weekend it was virtually neck-and-neck between Pochettino and De Boer. 'Pochettino has a 51 percent chance, De Boer 49,' said one source. And when Real Madrid lifted their 10th European crown in Lisbon on Saturday night, thus ending any hope of luring Ancelotti back to the capital, Levy knew it was time. Pochettino or De Boer? The former Espanyol manager's five-year deal at White Hart Lane seems a strong commitment given Levy's penchant for hiring and firing. Familiar face: Pochettino could raid former club Southampton for striker Jay Rodriguez. And it's hiring and firing that will take up much of Pochettino's time between now and the start of the season. He will be given a healthy transfer budget to strengthen the Spurs squad, with Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez among the early contenders to follow him from St Mary's. But last summer's splurge on over £100million worth of talent will mean there is not another blow out. Pochettino will be expected to coax the best out of his star-studded squad; in particular £30million misfit Erik Lamela. Last hurrah? Emmanuel Adebayor (right) could be leaving Tottenham following Pochettino's appointment. The Argentine will look to supplement his transfer budget by offloading a clutch of players: Emmanuel Adebayor, who is a target for Monaco, Roberto Soldado and Michael Dawson are among those who could go. Similarly, Pochettino will seek talks with unsettled duo Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris, who are both keen on moves to Champions League club's this summer. It's already been a busy summer for Pochettino; and it's about to get busier. Write highlights for this article.","output":"- Mauricio Pochettino appointed as Tottenham manager with a five-year-deal - English language concerns dispelled as Spurs chiefs discover Pochettino speaks English confidently - Pochettino will be given a healthy transfer budget and may target Southampton player Jay Rodriguez - Tottenham may offload players like Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado, and Michael Dawson - A busy summer ahead for Pochettino as he focuses on transfers and preparing Spurs for next season's Champions League"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

RFK’s killer moved to new prison SAN DIEGO — Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s killer was moved to a new prison in California on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Kennedy’s brother, President John F. Kennedy. Sirhan Sirhan, 69, was transferred Friday from the Corcoran prison in central California to the Richard J. Donovan prison in San Diego, more than 250 miles south. The move was routine, said Deborah Hoffman, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. “This transfer had been planned, and the date of the move is simply an unfortunate coincidence. On any given day, inmates are moved from institution to institution for a variety of reasons,” she told U-T San Diego. Sirhan shot Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, as he was leaving the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The senator had claimed victory in California’s Democratic presidential primary just moments earlier. Sirhan was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to life in prison in 1972. He has since spent time in several California prisons. Sirhan was denied parole in 2011 at a hearing where he said he had no memory of shooting Kennedy. His lawyers have claimed that Sirhan was framed in a conspiracy.

To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans.

Additionally, villages like Vatero are vital elements in understanding the historical background and development of the broader region, in this case, the city of Kozani, the West Macedonia region, and Greece as a whole. The relationship between Vatero and the concept of a village is evident in its function as a smaller, distinct community within the larger city of Kozani.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: All babies are different, and not all like to go to sleep the same way, but most like to be gently rocked. Try holding the baby in your arms and slowly swinging the baby back and forth, or holding the baby securely while walking around with a bouncy step, or rocking in a rocking chair. If the baby won't go to sleep, gently lift the baby up and lay the baby in its crib.  Never leave a baby in its crib on its back with its bottle in its hands because the baby could choke. After the baby is asleep, sit in the baby's room with it and wait to make sure the baby will stay asleep, and that the baby's sleep environment is safe -- Make sure there is nothing that the baby could play within the crib. It could distract the baby and it won't want to go to sleep. Also, soft toys should never be in a crib, because a baby could suffocate. Keep big, fluffy blankets or pillows out of the crib. Babies don't really need them and they are actually dangerous. Keep bed covers away from baby's face.  Do not lie a baby on its tummy, ever, even if the parent tells you too. Always place it on its back. Placing it on its tummy is very dangerous, and potentially fatal. (If the baby is old enough to flip itself over on its tummy by itself, though, it's okay if he flips himself over). Keep checking on the baby as it sleeps. This is very important as it is your babysitting duty to make sure that the baby is safe, is not fussing, is not too hot or cold and does not have a dirty diaper. Baby monitoring is fine if the parents are fine with it, if they don't have a baby monitor, or grant you permission to use them, check on them every 15 minutes. Summary:","output":"Babies are all different and need gentle rocking to help them sleep. Make sure the baby is safe in its crib, with no toys or soft things that could be dangerous. Always lay a baby on its back, and check on them while they sleep to make sure they are safe and comfortable.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: be done with Remy  B: accept the apology  C: be pardoned A:","output":"Based on the context provided, answer B: accept the apology, best answers the question regarding Jordan's reaction. When Remy realized their mistake, they took responsibility and sincerely apologized to Jordan. While it's not guaranteed that Jordan will accept the apology, considering that the context highlights Remy's remorse and admission of the mistake, it is most likely that Jordan will appreciate the gesture and accept the apology. This would encourage positive communication between them and potentially repair any damage that has been done to their relationship. Answer A: be done with Remy, seems quite negative and does not align well with the context provided as it assumes that Jordan will not accept Remy's apology and choose to end their relationship.

Tony Hall visit the country next week to assess a humanitarian crisis that has festered since the Gulf War of 1990, Hall's office said Monday. The Dayton Democrat, who has traveled to other crisis points including Sierra Leone and North Korea, will spend three days visiting hospitals and other facilities to seek understanding why aid has been ineffective in stemming malnourishment and other medical problems. Iraq has been under economic sanctions since the war ended, which some say have thwarted the country's ability to recover from the devastation of the bombing campaign. The Persian Gulf War destroyed much of the country's medical infrastructure, according to a report by the World Health Organization. In 1996 the WHO found that much of the population existed in a state of \`\`semi-starvation.'' Hall will be only the second member of Congress to travel in Iraq since the war, according to Hall's office. The last visitor was then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who went to help a pair of U.S. oilmen in diplomatic trouble. Hall flies to Amman, Jordan, on Friday, where he'll spend the night before driving to Iraq.

News article: GLOBAL FOOD      WASTE NOT, WANT NOT      Feeding the 9 Billion: The tragedy of waste      By 2075, the United Nations’ mid-range projection for global population growth predicts that human numbers will peak at about 9.5 billion people. This means that there could be an extra three billion mouths to feed by the end of the century, a period in which substantial changes are anticipated in the wealth, calorific intake and dietary preferences of people in developing countries across the world.      Such a projection presents mankind with wide-ranging social, economic, environmental and political issues that need to be addressed today to ensure a sustainable future for all. One key issue is how to produce more food in a world of finite resources.      Today, we produce about four billion metric tonnes of food per annum. Yet due to poor practices in harvesting, storage and transportation, as well as market and consumer wastage, it is estimated that 30–50% (or 1.2–2 billion tonnes) of all food produced never reaches a human stomach. Furthermore, this figure does not reflect the fact that large amounts of land, energy, fertilisers and water have also been lost in the production of foodstuffs which simply end up as waste. This level of wastage is a tragedy that cannot continue if we are to succeed in the challenge of sustainably meeting our future food demands.      Read the Global Food report [PDF, 1MB]      Where Food Waste Happens      In 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers identified three principal emerging population groups across the world, based on characteristics associated with their current and projected stage of economic development.      Fully developed, mature, post-industrial societies, such as those in Europe, characterised by stable or declining populations which are increasing in age.      Late-stage developing nations that are currently industrialising rapidly, for example China, which will experience decelerating rates of population growth, coupled with increasing affluence and age profile.      Newly developing countries that are beginning to industrialise, primarily in Africa, with high to very high population growth rates (typically doubling or tripling their populations by 2050), and characterised by a predominantly young age profile.      Each group over the coming decades will need to address different issues surrounding food production, storage and transportation, as well as consumer expectations, if we are to continue to feed all our people.      Third World and Developing Nations      In less-developed countries, such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, wastage tends to occur primarily at the farmer-producer end of the supply chain. Inefficient harvesting, inadequate local transportation and poor infrastructure mean that produce is frequently handled inappropriately and stored under unsuitable farm site conditions.      Developed Nations      In mature, fully developed countries such as the UK, more-efficient farming practices and better transport, storage and processing facilities ensure that a larger proportion of the food produced reaches markets and consumers. However, characteristics associated with modern consumer culture mean produce is often wasted through retail and customer behaviour.      Major supermarkets, in meeting consumer expectations, will often reject entire crops of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables at the farm because they do not meet exacting marketing standards for their physical characteristics, such as size and appearance. For example, up to 30% of the UK’s vegetable crop is never harvested as a result of such practices. Globally, retailers generate 1.6 million tonnes of food waste annually in this way.      Of the produce that does appear in the supermarket, commonly used sales promotions frequently encourage customers to purchase excessive quantities which, in the case of perishable foodstuffs, inevitably generate wastage in the home. Overall between 30% and 50% of what has been bought in developed countries is thrown away by the purchaser.      Better use of our Finite Resources      Wasting food means losing not only life-supporting nutrition but also precious resources, including land, water and energy. As a global society therefore, tackling food waste will help contribute towards addressing a number of key resource issues:      Effective Land Usage      Over the last five decades, improved farming techniques and technologies have helped to significantly increase crop yields along with a 12% expansion of farmed land use. However, with global food production already utilising about 4.9Gha of the 10Gha usable land surface available, a further increase in farming area without impacting unfavourably on what remains of the world’s natural ecosystems appears unlikely. The challenge is that an increase in animal-based production will require greater land and resource requirement, as livestock farming demands extensive land use. One hectare of land can, for example, produce rice or potatoes for 19–22 people per annum. The same area will produce enough lamb or beef for only one or two people. Considerable tensions are likely to emerge, as the need for food competes with demands for ecosystem preservation and biomass production as a renewable energy source.      Water Usage      Over the past century, fresh water abstraction for human use has increased at more than double the rate of population growth. Currently about 3.8 trillion m3 of water is used by humans per annum. About 70% of this is consumed by the global agriculture sector, and the level of use will continue to rise over the coming decades. Indeed, depending on how food is produced and the validity of forecasts for demographic trends, the demand for water in food production could reach 10–13 trillion m3 annually by mid-century. This is 2.5 to 3.5 times greater than the total human use of fresh water today.      Better irrigation can dramatically improve crop yield and about 40% of the world’s food supply is currently derived from irrigated land. However, water used in irrigation is often sourced unsustainably, through boreholes sunk into poorly managed aquifers. In some cases government development programmes and international aid interventions exacerbate this problem. In addition, we continue to use wasteful systems, such as flood or overhead spray, which are difficult to control and lose much of the water to evaporation. Although the drip or trickle irrigation methods are more expensive to install, they can be as much as 33% more efficient in water use as well as being able to carry fertilisers directly to the root.      In processing of foods after the agricultural stage, there are large additional uses of water that need to be tackled in a world of growing demand. This is particularly crucial in the case of meat production, where beef uses about 50 times more water than vegetables. In the future, more- effective washing techniques, management procedures, and recycling and purification of water will be needed to reduce wastage.      Energy Usage      Energy is an essential resource across the entire food production cycle, with estimates showing an average of 7–10 calories of input being required in the production of one calorie of food. This varies dramatically depending on crop, from three calories for plant crops to 35 calories in the production of beef. Since much of this energy comes from the utilisation of fossil fuels, wastage of food potentially contributes to unnecessary global warming as well as inefficient resource utilisation.      In the modern industrialised agricultural process – which developing nations are moving towards in order to increase future yields – energy usage in the making and application of agrochemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides represents the single biggest component. Wheat production takes 50% of its energy input for these two items alone. Indeed, on a global scale, fertiliser manufacturing consumes about 3–5% of the world’s annual natural gas supply. With production anticipated to increase by 25% between now and 2030, sustainable energy sourcing will become an increasingly major issue. Energy to power machinery, both on the farm and in the storage and processing facilities, together with the direct use of fuel in field mechanisation and produce transportation, adds to the energy total, which currently represents about 3.1% of annual global energy consumption.      Recommendations      Rising population combined with improved nutrition standards and shifting dietary preferences will exert pressure for increases in global food supply. Engineers, scientists and agriculturalists have the knowledge, tools and systems that will assist in achieving productivity increases. However, pressure will grow on finite resources of land, energy and water. The potential to provide 60–100% more food by simply eliminating losses, while simultaneously freeing up land, energy and water resources for other uses, is an opportunity that should not be ignored. In order to begin tackling the challenge, the Institution recommends that:      1. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) works with the international engineering community to ensure governments of developed nations put in place programmes that transfer engineering knowledge, design know-how, and suitable technology to newly developing countries. This will help improve produce handling in the harvest, and immediate post-harvest stages of food production.      2. Governments of rapidly developing countries incorporate waste minimisation thinking into the transport infrastructure and storage facilities currently being planned, engineered and built.      3. Governments in developed nations devise and implement policy that changes consumer expectations. These should discourage retailers from wasteful practices that lead to the rejection of food on the basis of cosmetic characteristics, and losses in the home due to excessive purchasing by consumers.      Download the IMechE Global Food Report [PDF, 1MB]      Read the Press Release on the Global Food: Waste Not, Want Not      See all IMechE Reports ||||| As much as half of all the food produced in the world – equivalent to 2bn tonnes – ends up as waste every year, engineers warned in a report published on Thursday.      The UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) blames the \\"staggering\\" new figures in its analysis on unnecessarily strict sell-by dates, buy-one-get-one free and Western consumer demand for cosmetically perfect food, along with \\"poor engineering and agricultural practices\\", inadequate infrastructure and poor storage facilities.      In the face of United Nations predictions that there could be about an extra 3 billion people to feed by the end of the century and growing pressure on the resources needed to produce food, including land, water and energy, the IMechE is calling for urgent action to tackle this waste.      Their report, Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not, found that between 30% and 50% or 1.2-2bn tonnes of food produced around the world never makes it on to a plate.      In the UK as much as 30% of vegetable crops are not harvested due to their failure to meet retailers' exacting standards on physical appearance, it says, while up to half of the food that is bought in Europe and the US is thrown away by consumers.      And about 550bn cubic metres of water is wasted globally in growing crops that never reach the consumer. Carnivorous diets add extra pressure as it takes 20-50 times the amount of water to produce 1 kilogramme of meat than 1kg of vegetables; the demand for water in food production could reach 10–13 trillion cubic metres a year by 2050.      This is 2.5 to 3.5 times greater than the total human use of fresh water today and could lead to more dangerous water shortages around the world, the IMechE says, claiming that there is the potential to provide 60-100% more food by eliminating losses and waste while at the same time freeing up land, energy and water resources.      Tim Fox, head of energy and environment at the IMechE, said: \\"The amount of food wasted and lost around the world is staggering. This is food that could be used to feed the world's growing population – as well as those in hunger today. It is also an unnecessary waste of the land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food.\\"      In order to prevent further waste, governments, development agencies and organisation like the UN \\"must work together to help change people's mindsets on waste and discourage wasteful practices by farmers, food producers, supermarkets and consumers,\\" the IMechE said.      • This article was amended on 10 January 2012 to change the abbreviation IME to IMechE. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A report by the UK's Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) reveals that up to half of the 4 billion metric tonnes of food produced per annum is wasted due to poor practices, strict sell-by dates, consumer preferences for visually perfect food, and inadequate infrastructure. This wastage occurs despite the United Nations predicting an extra 3 billion people to feed by 2075. The IMechE calls for urgent action to address the issue, which is contributing to potential water shortages around the world, suggesting that eliminating waste will provide more food and free up resources such as land, water, and energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He ceases to complete his homework, as he feels that everything seems meaningless. As a result, he is put on academic probation. The next day, George goes up to the school roof and sees Sally (Emma Roberts) smoking. When a teacher comes up, George quickly pulls out a cigarette and takes the blame. Sally meets George to thank him, and though George is at first reluctant to talk to her, he soon warms up to her. On Career Day, George meets a young artist, Dustin and is inspired by his thoughts about life. He brings Sally with him to visit Dustin and it becomes apparent that Dustin likes Sally. Sally invites George to a New Years Eve party. At the party, she dances with her ex, while George gets drunk, puking outside before falling asleep in the alley. Sally finds him there and apologizes. For Valentine's Day, the two go out to dinner and Sally asks him to have sex with her. George, clearly shocked, doesn't answer. After his pause, Sally says they shouldn't as he is her only real friend. He is quiet for the rest of the time they're together and goes home early. He doesn't answer Sally's calls or talk with her at all. Sally instead invites Dustin out and flirts with him. The two of them start going on dates after Dustin kisses her. George doesnt do his English term paper and is brought to the principals office. The principal gives George two choices: expulsion or do every piece of undone homework, about a years worth. At home, George confronts his stepfather about lying about work, and they get into a physical fight. George takes off for Sallys place. She brings him into the hallway, where he kisses her.

Options: - sore feet - amazement - retrospection - boredom - crowding  Explain why a human would choose \\"crowding\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"crowding\\" to answer the question above due to several reasons that are specifically related to the nature of narrow halls in museums and the implications of such a layout on the overall visitor experience. First, narrow halls are spaces with limited width, which directly affects the movement and accessibility of people within that area. When a museum exhibits its artifacts or artworks, visitors will naturally gravitate towards those halls as part of their experience. As more people congregate in the narrow halls, the available space for each person diminishes, leading to a feeling of crowding. In this context, crowding is the perception of physical discomfort due to the reduced personal space, which amplifies as more visitors enter the area. Second, museums are often popular tourist destinations that attract locals and foreigners alike. During peak seasons or special exhibitions, a significant influx of visitors can be expected. When this happens, the narrow halls are even more susceptible to congestion and overcrowding. This may result in longer waiting times to view the displays, limited capacity to appreciate the details, and, possibly, queues to enter the area. Consequently, the overall atmosphere may become somewhat unpleasant and suffocating. Third, crowding can also affect the social interactions and dynamics in the museum. In a crowded narrow hall, visitors may inadvertently bump into each other, cross each other's path, or block each other's view. This could create frustration and tensions among the visitors and could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. Additionally, visitors may feel a stronger need for personal space, consequently limiting the opportunity for meaningful conversations about the exhibits. Lastly, crowded narrow halls can impact the overall satisfaction, engagement, and learning experiences of museum-goers. Having to navigate through a densely packed space can be mentally exhausting and might cause some visitors to feel overwhelmed or anxious. Studies have shown that discomfort and negative feelings associated with crowding can overshadow the potential benefits of visiting a museum, such as learning, aesthetic pleasure, and engaging with history. The other options mentioned - sore feet, amazement, retrospection, and boredom - might also hold true for some visitors in a particular context, but they are less likely to be directly linked to the architectural feature of narrow halls. Sore feet could result from walking around a museum, regardless of the width of the halls, while amazement, retrospection, and boredom are largely determined by personal interest and engagement with the exhibits, rather than the physical dimensions of the space. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"crowding\\" as the answer to the question, as the presence of narrow halls in museums could result in discomfort, reduced personal space, and hindered accessibility owing to the high concentration of visitors in a limited area. This subsequently affects their overall satisfaction, engagement, and learning experiences during their visit."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

In geology, igneous refers to rock formed by what effect?","output":"In geology, the term \\"igneous\\" refers to a type of rock that is formed as a result of the cooling and solidification of molten material, known as magma or lava. This process is referred to as \\"crystallization\\" or \\"solidification,\\" and it is a primary mechanism by which the Earth's crust is generated and modified. Magma is a molten or partially molten rock material that is generated within the Earth's mantle or crust. The process by which magma forms is highly complex and involves many factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the source material. When rocks within the mantle or crust are subjected to extreme conditions, they may begin to melt, giving rise to the formation of magma. Once magma has formed, it may either remain within the Earth's interior or travel upwards towards the surface. The movement of magma can result in various geological events, such as volcanic eruptions or the emplacement of intrusive igneous bodies like plutons, dikes, sills, or laccoliths. Igneous rock can be further classified into two main categories based on its mode of formation: intrusive and extrusive. 1. Intrusive (Plutonic) Igneous Rocks: Intrusive igneous rocks are formed when magma remains within the Earth's crust or slowly cools and solidifies below the surface. The slow cooling process allows for the formation of large, visible mineral crystals, which are characteristic of this type of rock. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, gabbro, and diorite. 2. Extrusive (Volcanic) Igneous Rocks: Extrusive igneous rocks, on the other hand, are formed when magma reaches the Earth's surface and undergoes rapid cooling, either from being erupted as lava flows or fragmented into ash and other pyroclastic material during a volcanic explosion. Due to the rapid cooling, the crystals that form in extrusive rocks are usually much smaller and often microscopic. Examples of extrusive igneous rocks include basalt, andesite, and rhyolite. The composition of different igneous rocks also varies, depending on the chemical components present in the original magma. This can result in the formation of a diverse array of rock types, with different colors, textures, and mineral compositions. In general, igneous rocks are categorized based on their silica content (a compound found in many rock-forming minerals), which plays a significant role in determining their physical and chemical properties. For instance, rocks with high silica content are generally light in color, have high viscosity, and produce highly explosive volcanic eruptions. These are referred to as felsic or acidic rocks, and examples include granite and rhyolite. In contrast, rocks with low silica content tend to be darker in color, have lower viscosity, and typically produce more effusive eruptions. These rocks, known as mafic or basic rocks, include basalt and gabbro. In conclusion, the term \\"igneous\\" in geology refers to rocks formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The environment in which magma cools, along with the chemical composition of the source material, ultimately determines the characteristics of the resulting igneous rock. Understanding the processes behind igneous rock formation is essential for studying the formation and evolution of the Earth's crust and the various geological phenomena associated with it."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\").

Though it might seem obvious that a reward could encourage young children to eat their vegetables, the idea is actually controversial, researchers wrote in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. That's because some studies have shown that rewards can _ and cause children to lose interest in foods they already liked, said Jane Wardle, a researcher at University College London who worked on the study. Verbal praise, such as \\"Brilliant! You're a great vegetable taster,\\" did not work as well. The study found t hat when parents gave their small children a sticker each time they took a \\"tiny taste\\" of a disliked vegetable, it gradually changed their attitudes. The children were also willing to eat more of the vegetables-either carrots, celery, cucumber, red pepper, cabbage or sugar snap peas-in laboratory taste tests, the study said. Researchers randomly assigned 173 families to one of these groups. In one, parents used stickers to reward their children each time they took a tiny sample of a disliked vegetable. A second group of parents used verbal praise. The third group, where parents used no special vegetable-promoting methods, served as a \\"control\\". Parents in the reward groups offered their children a taste of the \\"target\\" vegetable every day of 12 days, Soon after, children in the sticker group were giving higher ratings to the vegetables-and were willing to eat more in the research lab, going from an average of 5 grams at the start to about 10 grams after the 12-day experience. The turnaround also seemed to last, with preschoolers in the sticker group still willing to eat more of the once disliked vegetable three months later. Why didn't the verbal praise work? Wardle said the parents' words may have seemed \\"insincere\\" to their children.   Question: The purpose of writing the passage is  _  .

Carthage was Palermo’s major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the Ancient Greeks between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the Sicilian Wars, a conflict fought between the Greeks of Syracuse and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the Greeks named the settlement Panormos (Πάνορμος) from which the current name is derived, meaning \\"all port\\" due to the shape of its coast. It was from Palermo that Hamilcar I's fleet (which was defeated at the Battle of Himera) was launched. In 409 B.C. the city was looted by Hermocrates of Syracuse. The Sicilian Wars ended in 265 BC when Carthage and Syracuse stopped warring and united in order to stop the Romans from gaining full control of the island during the First Punic War. In 276 BC, during the Pyrrhic War, Panormos briefly became a Greek colony after being conquered by Pyrrhus of Epirus, but returned to Phoenician Carthage in 275. In 254 BC Panormos was besieged and conquered by the Romans in the first battle of Panormus (the name Latin name). Carthage attempted to reconquer Panormus in 251 BC but failed.

Read More      This undated picture released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on May 28, 2013 shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, inspecting the August 25 Fishery Station under the Korean People's Army Unit 313. Close      North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first appearance without a cane since emerging from a six-week seclusion that prompted speculation about his health and grip on power.      Kim clapped his hands and walked alongside hundreds of troops applauding him in photos released today by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, run by the ruling Workers’ Party. He attended a meeting of battalion commanders and political instructors yesterday in Pyongyang, the paper said.      “The photo dispels the lingering sense of uncertainty that was associated with the cane,” Yoo Ho Yeol, a professor of North Korea studies at Korea University based at Sejong in South Korea, said by phone. “He’s trying to show he can walk without a problem.”      Kim, who returned to the public gaze with the cane in mid-October, exercises dynastic control of the North’s 1.2 million troops and nuclear arms program. He recently ordered the shooting of about 10 senior party officials on charges including graft and watching South Korean soap operas, South Korean lawmaker Shin Kyoung Min said Oct. 29, citing a briefing by the National Intelligence Service in Seoul.      Kim, believed to be around 30, had a cyst removed from his right ankle in September or October, according to Lim Dae Sung, a secretary to South Korean lawmaker Lee Cheol Woo, who also attended the intelligence briefing.      The leader took power in late 2011 after his father Kim Jong Il died. North Korea has since conducted its third nuclear test and launched a long-range rocket that put a satellite in orbit. The U.S. and South Korea say the launch was a test of ballistic missile technology banned under United Nations Security Council resolutions.

Question with options to choose from: Why is the narrator bullish on La Verne ? Select from the following. - The narrator sees his sister went there . - The narrator sees his parents went there . - The narrator sees his teachers went there . - None of the above choices .","output":"The narrator is bullish on La Verne because they see their teachers went there. In the given passage, the narrator explicitly mentions that two of the teachers at their school obtained their Bachelor's degrees at La Verne, which implies that the quality of education there is proven to be reliable. Besides the credential of their teachers, the narrator is also considering the cost and duration of the program. While they acknowledge La Verne's higher cost, they also express their inability to stretch their education over a longer period. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the reasons behind the narrator's inclination for La Verne: 1. Teachers' experience: The narrator knows two teachers at their school who successfully acquired their degrees from La Verne. This serves as a credible testimony to the quality of education provided by the institution. In addition, having a personal connection to someone who has attended the university can offer valuable insights and guidance in navigating the educational experience. 2. Reputation: The fact that the narrator initially mentions La Verne and is discussing the cost as a potential drawback could indicate that they are impressed with the school's reputation. They might have heard about its academic excellence, extracurricular programs, or other matters contributing to an outstanding educational experience. 3. Time and cost factors: While the narrator identifies that attending La Verne is more expensive, they emphasize that they cannot afford to draw out their education over a longer duration. It is possible that La Verne offers a more compact or accelerated program compared to the other institutions the narrator is exploring. Additionally, despite the higher cost, La Verne may have other factors that offset the financial burden, like better employment opportunities, scholarships, or financial aid. 4. Other schools' information: The narrator is still waiting for more information from other institutions but has formed an initial preference for La Verne. This could signal that La Verne has already shown them compelling offerings in terms of programs, classes, or support. As they gather further details, they will have a better basis for comparing other schools with La Verne, but for now, La Verne stands out as the most promising option. In conclusion, the primary reason behind the narrator's bullishness on La Verne is the fact that their teachers graduated from that university, which provides them with trust in the quality of education, as well as a personal connection to the institution. Moreover, the factors like time and cost considerations, along with the comparison to other schools, make La Verne an appealing choice for the narrator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

Three men have been arrested after a group of students fell ill after taking an illegal hallucinogenic drug they bought on the internet. One of the six men - all aged between 19 and 22 - remains in a critical condition following the incident at a terraced house in Jesmond a suburb of Newcastle. The group of students, some from Newcastle University, were found at 3am early yesterday having taken 2CB, which is similar to ecstasy. Raid: Raid: Police are investigating after six students were rushed to hospital after taking the illegal hallucinogenic drug 2CB. Some eight people were at the house. when officers arrived and neighbours said they heard revellers coming. and going into the early hours. Five people who were treated at the. Royal Victoria Infirmary have now been discharged but a sixth remained. critically ill, Northumbria Police said. Officers have now arrested a third man on suspicion of supplying the drug. The 20-year-old remains in police custody. Last night Northumbria Police said two 23-year-olds had been arrested and bailed pending further inquiries. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Enquiries to establish exactly. what happened continue, with officers warning people about the dangers. of taking any illegal drugs - especially those bought over the. internet.' Newcastle University has circulated a warning about 2CB via an email to students. It appears there may have been a party at. the terraced house in Ripon Gardens, a street popular with students at. the elite university. Bev Faulder, a teaching assistant,. said: ‘I heard them running around, shouting and carrying on. We’ve had a. lot of trouble with noise at night but they are a lovely bunch of lads. when you see them during the day and I hope they’re all right.’ A total of eight people were at the property when officers arrived at about 3am during an apparent party at the house. Another, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I couldn’t sleep because there was a lot of noise. At around 2am I heard some taxis coming and going. There was a lot of boys’ banter.’ In November last year, the government banned mexxy and black mamba and made class B drugs. Mexxy, which is sold as an. alternative to ketamine was linked to two deaths and police have warned. of the 'life-threatening effects' of black mamba. A record 57 new legal highs were detected last year alone. An European Union report said it had found that more than one new psychoactive drug went on the market every week. Drug experts say while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs. A third added: ‘I thought they were that sort of thing because there were often strange smells coming from the house.’ 2CB is a Class A drug which often comes in purple capsules and is an hallucinogen related to ecstasy popular in Europe. It is also sold as white powder or small pills and is particularly dangerous when mixed with other substances. On the street, it is also known as Bromo, Nexus, CB, Performax, Spectrum, Venus, Erox or Cloud Nine. A team of ten police officers were seen searching the house and appeared to be looking in the drains. A. Northumbria police spokesperson said: ‘At this stage police believe. they have taken an hallucinogenic drug called 2CB which at this stage is. believed has been bought over the internet. ‘The exact reason for hospitalisation. is unclear at present and could be due to a suspected overdose or mixing. the drug with another substance, or a bad reaction.’ Neighbours said they had heard revellers coming and going from the house into the early hours. Officers are now warning students and other young people to beware the dangers of illegal drugs - especially those bought over the internet. The relevant course heads at Newcastle University are understood to have been notified. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

Later, the police came and some of the young men were taken to the hospital. One of them was still very sick, while the others were getting better.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the statement you found on Google does not directly answer the question about what Phylum Cnidaria is. Instead, it talks about the rarity of fossils of certain types of cnidarians. Allow me to provide a comprehensive answer to your question. Phylum Cnidaria is a group of aquatic, mostly marine invertebrate animals that belongs to the kingdom Animalia. This phylum includes over 10,000 diverse species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras. The name \\"Cnidaria\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"cnidos,\\" which means \\"stinging nettle.\\" This is due to the presence of specialized cells called cnidocytes or cnidae, which contain specialized organelles called nematocysts. Nematocysts are used by these animals for capturing prey, defense, and sometimes locomotion. Cnidarians exhibit radial symmetry, meaning their body parts are arranged symmetrically around a central axis. This distinguishes them from bilateral animals like vertebrates and most other invertebrates. They also have a simple body plan that consists of two main cell layers, the outer epidermis and the inner gastrodermis, with a gelatinous mesoglea sandwiched in between. The absence of complex organs is another defining characteristic of this phylum. Cnidarians can be either sessile (attached to a surface and non-moving) or free-floating, and their life cycle consists of two main forms: the polyp stage and the medusa stage. The polyp stage is sessile and usually reproduces asexually through budding, while the medusa stage is free-floating and typically reproduces sexually. In some cnidarians, like corals, the medusa stage may be absent entirely. Phylum Cnidaria can be further classified into four main classes: 1. Class Anthozoa: This class includes sea anemones and corals. These animals are exclusively polyps and generally do not have a medusa stage. They have a relatively large size variation and can be solitary or colonial. 2. Class Scyphozoa: This class comprises the \\"true\\" jellyfish. They have a dominant medusa stage with a reduced polyp stage. Most members of this class have a bell or umbrella-shaped body with long tentacles. 3. Class Hydrozoa: This class contains hydras, fire corals, and other related species. They exhibit a both polyp and medusa stages, but the medusa stage is often reduced or absent. Some hydrozoans, like hydras, are exclusively freshwater species. 4. Class Cubozoa: This class includes the dangerous box jellies or sea wasps. They have a box-shaped medusa with highly complex eyes and tentacles that contain potent venomous nematocysts. In conclusion, Phylum Cnidaria is a diverse group of aquatic invertebrate animals, primarily marine, characterized by radial symmetry, a simple body plan, and the presence of specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes. It includes a wide variety of species such as jellyfish, sea anemones, corals, and hydras, and can be further divided into four main classes: Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, Hydrozoa, and Cubozoa. The answer you found on Google is related but does not accurately describe the key features of Phylum Cnidaria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Question: What are people doing when washing hands for a long time?  Choices:  - thinking - sleeping - use soap - irritation - cleaning dirt off  The rationale to choose \\"thinking\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The answer \\"thinking\\" is the most appropriate choice in this scenario, given the context of the question and the options provided. When people wash their hands for an extended period, they might be lost in thought or contemplating various aspects of their lives while engaging in this routine yet essential activity. This prolonged duration could be due to various reasons, such as using handwashing as a way to reflect on their thoughts, manage stress, or take a break from a busy day. While the other choices could be relevant in certain circumstances, they may not necessarily be the most accurate response to this question. Here's a brief analysis of the other choices: - Sleeping: It is unlikely that one can be asleep while washing their hands, as this activity requires alertness and active participation in order to effectively clean one's hands. - Use soap: Although using soap is a crucial aspect of proper handwashing, merely using soap does not necessarily mean that a person is washing their hands for a prolonged duration. Using soap is a part of handwashing, but it does not explain the extended time spent on the activity. - Irritation: While washing hands for a long time might cause irritation to the skin, especially if one uses harsh soaps or scrubbing too hard, it is not a primary reason for people to wash their hands longer than usual. In fact, if one experiences irritation, they would typically avoid washing their hands for an extended period to prevent further discomfort. - Cleaning dirt off: Although the primary purpose of handwashing is to clean dirt and germs from the skin, it is not always the sole reason for a person to wash their hands for a longer time. In general, a thorough handwashing process should take about 20 seconds. If someone is washing their hands for significantly longer than that, it suggests that there might be other reasons in play, such as thinking or reflecting. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"thinking\\" as the answer is based on the understanding that extended handwashing sessions are often indicative of a person being deep in thought or contemplation. Other options, while relevant in certain scenarios, do not provide a comprehensive explanation for the extended handwashing duration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CHCOOH (also written as CHCOH or CHO). When undiluted, it is sometimes called \\"glacial acetic acid\\". Vinegar is roughly 39% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. Although it is classified as a weak acid, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.  - In chemistry, structural theory explains the large variety in chemical compounds in terms of atoms making up molecules, the order in which atoms are put together in molecules and the electrons that hold them together. According to structural theory, from the structural formula of a molecule it is possible to derive physical and spectroscopic data and to predict chemical reactivity.  - Hermann Kolbe ( Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe , 27 Sept. 1818 -- 25 Nov. 1884 ) , was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry as Professor at Marburg and Leipzig . Kolbe coined the term synthesis , and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the biologic natural product acetic acid from carbon disulfide , to structural theory via modifications to the idea of \`\` radicals '' and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols , and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts , the Kolbe - Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin , and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis . After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen , Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London ( with Frankland ) , and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the Journal für Praktische Chemie , to be elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and to win the Royal Society of London 's Davy Medal in the year of his death . Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists ( including Zaitsev , Curtius , Beckmann , Graebe , Markovnikov , etc. ) , Kolbe is remembered for editing the Journal for more than a decade , where his rejection of Kekulé 's structure of benzene , va n't Hoff 's theory on the origin of chirality , and von Baeyer 's reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent . Kolbe died of a heart attack in Leipzig at age 68 , six years after the death of his wife , Charlotte . He was survived by four children .  - The Parthe is a river in Saxony, Germany, right tributary of the White Elster. Its total length is 60 km. The Parthe originates in northern Saxony, between Colditz and Bad Lausick. It flows northwest through Parthenstein, Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha before entering the city of Leipzig. The Parthe joins the White Elster in northwestern Leipzig.  - Carbon (from \\"coal\\") is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.  - Élan vital is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in his 1907 book \\"Creative Evolution\\", in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner. \\"Elan vital\\" was translated in the English edition as \\"vital impetus\\", but is usually translated by his detractors as \\"vital force\\". It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness - with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time.  - Hermann Kolbe (\\"Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe\\", 27 September 1818  25 November 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry. He was a Professor at Marburg and Leipzig. Kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide, and also contributed to the development of structural theory. This was done via modifications to the idea of \\"radicals\\" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his Kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts, the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. After studies with Wöhler and Bunsen, Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with Frankland), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the .

He was survived by four children.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The Kolbe electrolysis or Kolbe reaction is an organic reaction named after Hermann Kolbe. The Kolbe reaction is formally a decarboxylative dimerisation of two carboxylic acids (or carboxylate ions) The overall general reaction is:  - Organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure, properties, and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials, i.e., matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms. Study of structure includes many physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and the chemical constitution of organic compounds and materials. Study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties, and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity, with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form (when possible), but also in solutions, mixtures, and fabricated forms. The study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds (e.g., natural products, drugs, polymers, etc.) by chemical synthesis, as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules, both in the laboratory and via theoretical (in silico) study.  - Cellulose acetate is the acetate ester of cellulose. It was first prepared in 1865. Cellulose acetate is used as a film base in photography, as a component in some coatings, and as a frame material for eyeglasses; it is also used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of cigarette filters and playing cards. In photographic film, cellulose acetate replaced nitrate film in the 1950s, being far less flammable and cheaper to produce.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - In silico (literally Latin for \\"in silicon\\", alluding to the mass use of silicon for semiconductor computer chips) is an expression used to mean \\"performed on computer or via computer simulation.\\" The phrase was coined in 1989 as an allusion to the Latin phrases \\"in vivo\\", \\"in vitro\\", and \\"in situ\\", which are commonly used in biology (see also systems biology) and refer to experiments done in living organisms, outside of living organisms, and where they are found in nature, respectively.  - Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 520% acetic acid (CHCOOH), water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today.  - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. It is an independent, non-governmental scientific organisation which takes special responsibility for the natural sciences and mathematics, but endeavours to promote the exchange of ideas between various disciplines.  - Vitalism is a discredited scientific hypothesis that \\"living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things\\". Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the \\"vital spark\\", \\"energy\\" or \\"élan vital\\", which some equate with the soul.  - The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a negative elementary electric charge. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. The electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton. Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, \\"\\". As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all matter, electrons have properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger De Broglie wavelength for a given energy.  - An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).  - Leipzig is the largest city in the federal state of Saxony, Germany. With a population of 570,087 inhabitants (1,001,220 residents in the larger urban zone) it is Germany's tenth most populous city. Leipzig is located about southwest of Berlin at the confluence of the White Elster, Pleisse and Parthe rivers at the southern end of the North German Plain.

The kitchen, with its dark corners and mysterious creaking sounds, sent shivers down their spines whenever they had to venture into its realm. The old, worn-out wooden floorboards creaked loudly underfoot, making it impossible to move stealthily even when they wanted to quickly fetch a snack. To add to the uneasiness, the old countertops were stained, and the yellowed, peeling wallpaper whispered sinister secrets to their young, impressionable minds. In contrast, the basement was a haven for the children. Though typically thought of as a dark and scary space, their parents had done a remarkable job of transforming the basement into a warm, inviting play area. Brightly colored rugs and mats cushioned the floor, protecting little knees during playtime. Shelves overflowing with toys, games, and books lined the walls, offering endless entertainment options. There was also a comfortable couch nestled into a cozy nook, perfect for snuggling up with a favorite story or listening to music. Sometimes, the children would have slumber parties in the basement, staying up late, sharing stories, and giggling away their fear of the kitchen above. They would create elaborate forts with cushions and blankets, transforming the space into new worlds and secret hideaways. The basement was also their ultimate safe space when a thunderstorm would roll in, as its thick walls and insulation masked the scary sounds of the wind and rain. Throughout their time in the house, the children continued to share an unspoken agreement: the basement was their magical sanctuary, while the kitchen was a place to be wary of. Even as they grew older, this understanding remained, solidifying a bond between them and their fond childhood memories. Though the kitchen never did become a welcoming space for the children, they always had each other and the comforting embrace of the basement to keep their imaginations alive and their fears at bay. In hindsight, the seemingly exaggerated fear of the kitchen would always serve as a reminder that these young minds craved adventure, escapism, and a place to freely express themselves. The basement provided just that - a canvas for their creativity and a world of possibility. And so, the basement remained the children's favorite place, a retreat from the unsettling atmosphere of the mysterious kitchen, where they could let their imaginations roam, embark on wild adventures together, and cherish the magic of their childhood, one playtime after another."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect. Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it's director, it has no where better to go. We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do. Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist. The film is really about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy for real? If Clay has not seen YouTube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people.  The rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than his own personal celebrity status.

I wanted to add some color to the bedroom so I chose red pillows over grey pillows because the","output":"grey ones seemed too dull. I thought the red would create a bold statement and add some energy to the room. Step 1: Assess the current bedroom design and layout Before making any significant changes, I need to consider the existing design elements in the room. What are the current colors of the walls, furniture, and other decor? This will help to ensure that the new red pillows will complement the overall design of the space. Step 2: Choose the right shade of red There are various shades of red, ranging from deep maroon to bright crimson. I will choose a shade that is vibrant but will not overpower the rest of the room. The goal is to add a pop of color, but still maintain a sense of balance. Step 3: Select the right pattern, texture, and size for the red pillows In addition to color, the pattern, texture, and size of the pillows will also play a significant role in their overall impact on the room. I will choose pillows that have a subtle pattern or no pattern at all, as a bold pattern might make them too overwhelming. A subtle texture can add depth without being too distracting. I will also keep in mind the current size of the other pillows in the room, and choose the new red pillows with dimensions that are complementary to maintain a cohesive look. Step 4: Decide on the pillow arrangement How the red pillows are positioned along with other pillows on the bed or furniture can determine the overall effect they have on the room's design. Arranging them with some thought can help achieve the desired outcome. I may place the red pillows in the front and at the center if I want them to be the focal point, or position them more in the background, if I want them to simply add a hint of color. Step 5: Evaluate the result and make adjustments if necessary After placing the new red pillows in the bedroom, I will step back and assess the overall appearance of the room. If the pillows seem to dominate the space too much, I may need to try a different shade, pattern, or positioning. On the other hand, if they blend in nicely and add the desired pop of color, the task is complete. By following these steps, I have successfully added some color to the bedroom using red pillows, creating a more visually appealing and energized space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What are the full names of the drummers of Warsaw? is inside the article: On 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols' performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols \\"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\\". The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he \\"knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\\"Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \\"Stiff Kittens\\", but the band settled on \\"Warsaw\\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \\"Warszawa\\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.In August..., can you guess it ?

Try to teach water treading as soon as your child is capable of following directions and copying the example you set for them. For most kids, this is usually around 2-5 years old. Since younger kids are more prone to accidental drowning, teaching this skill helps to keep them safe. Rather than jumping right in and treading water, it is better to safely work on land. Start by the different parts of the body (first the arms and then the legs). An ideal place to practice these movements is at a playground. Start by simply breathing with your child. Instruct them to try breathing in for a count of four, and out to a count of four. In time, ask them to try increasing the number to five or six. Maintaining a slow, steady flow of breath helps your child to stay calm and tread water effectively. Make sure your child knows that in order to tread water, they must be in a vertical position with their head above the water. As your child  works on breathing and arm movement exercises, make sure they remain upright.  If your child is not in a vertical position with their head out of the water, they are technically swimming. While it is important to teach your child to swim, the ability to tread water should come first.","output":"Kids should learn to stay in one place in the water, called \\"treading water,\\" before they learn to swim.

Watt prefers to be called Justin.","output":"While J.J. Watt's full name is Justin James Watt, it is unclear whether he prefers to be called Justin. J.J. Watt, as he is commonly known, might have adapted this moniker for ease of recognition, brand promotion, or personal preference. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Watt prefers to be called Justin based on the information provided. J.J. Watt has become an iconic and recognizable figure within the NFL, and people around the world widely know him by this nickname. It is possible that the nickname originated from his family, friends, or teammates, or that he chose it himself. Regardless of the origin, the name J.J. Watt has become synonymous with his on-field prowess and philanthropic efforts. Additionally, many athletes adopt shortened or abbreviated versions of their names, as it becomes their public persona and is often easier for fans, teammates, and media to refer to and remember. This is true in the case of Watt as well. It's important to note that while J.J. Watt has not explicitly stated his preference for being called Justin, the use of a nickname in the public and professional setting does not necessarily reflect an individual's preference in their personal life. In summary, based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively infer that J.J. Watt prefers to be called Justin. The adoption of a recognizable nickname in professional sports is common and serves many purposes such as ease of recognition, branding, and promotion. To understand Watt's true preference, we would need more information about his personal life and experiences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Answer:","output":"ii. comes and leads his song into several people riding on camels. As the scene unfolds, the man starts singing an enchanting melody that appears to be an ancient nomadic tune, passed down through generations. This man, clothed in a traditional desert attire, seems to encapsulate the very essence of the desert's soul. His voice is strong and resonant, a testament to the fortitude of the people who have learned to thrive in this unforgiving landscape. He walks confidently among the camels and their riders, feeling in sync with the rhythm of the song. As he sings, other riders on camels gradually come into view. There's a palpable sense of camaraderie among them, a feeling of shared purpose and brotherhood. Each rider dons unique and colorful attire, a vivid display of the region's cultural diversity. They ride effortlessly, having mastered the art of camel riding from an early age. Mothers, fathers, and children alike all expertly balance atop their camels, a shared expression of joy and satisfaction on their faces. The desert sun beats down on this nomadic scene while the wind carries sand and the melodic tune in equal measure. It's as if the very environment is supportive of their journey, encouraging them to continue exploring the unknown. The riders’ jovial laughter and the camel's rhythmic grunts harmonize with the man's song, imbuing a sense of belonging to this tribe of desert wanderers. As the group treks further, they exchange stories, tales of their ancestors, and legends about their people's history that have been passed down through oral tradition. The song, thus, becomes a living and breathing account of their collective experience, an ode to their culture and way of life. Clusters of tents and vendors appear on the horizon, signaling the approach of a sprawling desert marketplace. The riders and their singing guide enter the bustling market, teeming with activity and life. The song comes to an end, just as the camels are led to a resting spot near the market. The scene now presents a striking contrast between the harsh desert landscape and the vibrant community that thrives upon it. As the story continues, the riders will once again mount their camels and venture forth, guided by the wisdom of their ancestors and the music they carry through the sands of time. Their tale reminds us that despite the overwhelming odds against them, resilience and unity endure in the face of great adversity, and that the spirit of adventure burns brightly in the hearts of those who dare to explore the world beyond their own lives. It is this genuine connectedness, both to each other and the land around them, that truly sets these desert wanderers apart."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In that very moment, while staring at his reflection he found in his eyes that mad look he had last seen thirty years ago in a photograph taken at a tethered flying model competition. The photo was taken by Henryk the servant, when his little charge decided he wanted a red biplane model Curtiss Consolidated Skyhawk Cruisader 3A \\"Bingo Star\\". This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

Here are possible answers to this question: - kid's house - studio - large house - house in england - mansion  I believe the correct choice is \\"large house\\", here's why: A:","output":"\\"Large house\\" is certainly a possible answer, but it's important to consider all the options before reaching a conclusion. The drawing room is traditionally a space designed for entertaining guests, and its existence among fifty rooms suggests a sizeable residence. Let's examine each of the alternatives provided: 1. Kid's house: This option is unlikely, as a child's playhouse is usually not as extensive and would not comprise fifty rooms, including a drawing room. 2. Studio: Studios are generally small living spaces, combining the bedroom, living room, and kitchen into a single area. Given the limited nature of a studio, it's improbable for it to consist of fifty rooms and a drawing room. 3. Large house: This is a plausible answer, as many large homes could have numerous rooms, including a drawing room. Large houses could be expected to accommodate multiple rooms for different purposes, catering to the lifestyle and needs of the inhabitants. 4. House in England: While a house in England may indeed have a drawing room, not all English houses are large enough to contain fifty rooms. On the other hand, English stately homes or manors have been known to be quite expansive, making this answer a possible contender as well. 5. Mansion: Mansions are residences renowned for their grandeur and spaciousness, often boasting numerous rooms. It's highly likely that a mansion would have a drawing room among its fifty rooms, making this a feasible answer, too. In conclusion, although \\"large house\\" is a reasonable choice, the correct answer could also be a \\"mansion\\" or a \\"house in England,\\" particularly if referring to a stately home or manor. The presence of a drawing room and fifty rooms in total strongly suggests a grand residence, which is typically consistent with mansions or sizable English homes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What towns are located near the Kilauea, and how does this volcano's activity compare to the volcanoes in Russia? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"No, these two questions are not the same. The first question asks about the towns located near the Kilauea volcano, which is situated in the southeast part of Hawaii's Big Island, and wants to contrast Kilauea's volcanic activity with those located in Europe. Data relevant to European volcanoes, such as Mount Etna in Italy or Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, will respond to this question. In contrast, the second question wants to compare the same Hawaiian volcano, Kilauea, with those in Russia, not Europe. Volcanoes to be taken into account here would include those situated on the Kamchatka Peninsula, like Klyuchevskaya Sopka, or perhaps even those in the Kuril Islands. Each question involves distinct geographical areas and different sets of volcanoes, and hence they need divergent types of data and analyses. While the first part of both questions, relating to towns near Kilauea, can be analogously answered, the comparative sections of the questions require unique information contingent on the specific regions indicated - Europe or Russia. To speak of the towns near Kilauea, those located within a rather close distance include Volcano, Pahala, and Mountain View. Moreover, the largest nearby city is Hilo. In terms of volcanic activity, Kilauea is known to be among the most active on Earth. The differences between Kilauea's activity and volcanoes in Europe or Russia would vary. European volcanoes such as Mount Etna or Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull are also notably active; however, their eruptions and behaviors can vary in nature. For instance, Eyjafjallajökull's 2010 eruption generated a significant ash cloud that disrupted air travel but was not marked by the same level of molten lava flow seen in many Kilauea eruptions. On the other hand, Russia's Klyuchevskaya Sopka is also one of the world's most active volcanoes, with frequent eruptions. However, its activity is characterized by towering ash plumes and pyroclastic flows, which differs from Kilauea's relatively consistent and less explosive effusive eruptions, which result in slow-moving lava flows. Thus, while both questions involve a comparison of Kilauea's volcanic activity with other regions, the specific volcanoes, their behaviors, and the contexts involved in those regions differ significantly, which makes the questions distinct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Frenzal Rhomb is an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992, with Jason Whalley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this entire period. In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), In July 1996, Frenzal Rhomb released their second album, Not So Tough Now, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, TISM, Dave Graney), Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker, The Mavis's) and Frenzal Rhomb. Just after its appearance, Costello was replaced by Lindsay McDougall on lead guitar and backing vocals - Costello left to attend university and become an animal rights activist. In November, the group issued a CD EP, Punch in the Face and, in January 1997, performed at Big Day Out. Late that year they toured the US supporting Blink-182.  In September 1997, their third LP, Meet the Family, was released, which reached the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and became their first certified gold album by ARIA. It spawned three singles, \\"Mr Charisma\\" (June), \\"There's Your Dad\\" (September), and \\"Mum Changed the Locks\\" (April 1998). The latter title refers to McDougall telling his mother he was going out to a movie when leaving for an interstate tour and returning to find his key no longer opened the front door. Also in April, Gordon \\"Gordy\\" Forman replaced Nykyruj on drums, and they toured Australia with US ska band Blue Meanies. Frenzal Rhomb were the head-liners for the Australian leg of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour and they were recruited for the US edition. A 1998 version of Meet the Family contained a bonus disc, Mongrel, that was recorded live on this US leg.  In March 1999, they released their next album, A Man's Not a Camel, which was produced by Eddie Ashworth and was supported by a nationwide tour.

Ever hear of a pocket?\\" In this part of the post, the speaker is directing a derogatory and insulting comment towards a woman, calling her a \\"gross skank.\\" This meets the criteria for expressing hate towards a woman. Part #2: Check if the hateful post encourages violence. Usage: In the given post, there is no encouragement of violence. The post uses derogatory language, but it doesn't encourage any physical harm or violence towards the targeted individuals. Part #3: Determine if the post is hateful towards other groups, but not immigrants and women. Usage: The post does not mention any other groups besides women. There is no mention of immigrants or any other group, so this part does not apply to this example. Based on the analysis of the given parts, the solution for this task would be \\"hateful\\" because the post contains hateful language directed towards a woman specifically."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in a subterranean compound beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but disappears moments later, and wakes up back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield during World War I, is shot in the leg, and then is suddenly transported to 1996. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is shot in the leg?, what is it ?

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.  Question: \\"What resulted in the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor?\\" Response: \\"The trade and fuel embargo\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Despite the current east-west tension and earlier Russian doubts over whether the British singer should be allowed fly, she is slated to go into orbit in autumn 2015.      “She will begin training at Star City in January 2015 and we are all waiting for her,” said Yuri Lonchakov, head of the Russia’s Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre.      A training plan for Brightman has already been compiled, he said.      “I believe her training will be successful,” he added.      She will enjoy a ten day stay on the ISS with an expected launch date of 4 October 2015.      poll loading Is £31million a rip-off for the trip? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO      Earlier, Russian space officials had questioned her commitment and suggested she had used her application to become a cosmonaut as a publicity stunt.      “It is very likely that the singer made an announcement about her possible trip to the International Space Station in order to advertise the release of her new album and to stir up interest in her world tour,” said an anonymous Russian source in November 2012.      An official also claimed that it would be better to send a professional cosmonaut, griping: “It is not clear how the upcoming three years, one of which the singer will spend in constant travelling around the world, will affect her health.”      However, any problems now seemed to have ironed out with the Russians possibly seeing their own propaganda advantage in allowing her to make the trip amid the worst rift in relations with the West since the Cold War.      One of Russia’s most experienced cosmonauts will chaperone the star into space. Sergei Volkov - the son of a spaceman - will command her Soyuz TMA-18M mission from Baikanour in Kazakhstan, with the tird place going to Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen.      Lonchakov said that the famous singer has already passed a number of medical examinations and tests.

The sum she is paying for the trip remains a commercial secret but sources have suggested it is in the order of £31 million.      “It is a large sum of money - it is tens of millions of dollars,” according to Roscosmos manned programmes supervisor Alexei Krasnov.      Tom Shelley, the president of US-based Space Adventures Ltd, is on record as saying: “She is absolutely 100 percent committed. She”s putting together her mission plan now.”      She will be the first professional singer in space and the eighth tourist.      The former wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber said at a Moscow press conference announcing her flight: “This voyage is a product of a dream, my dream. Finally it can be a reality. I am more excited about this than anything I have done in my life to date.”      She raised the possibility she might “sing a song from space”.      In 1978 with Hot Gossip she sang “I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper”. ||||| British soprano Sarah Brightman will begin training in January for a 2015 visit to the International Space Station, the Russian news agency Tass reported this week.      Brightman, 54, launched into the global spotlight in the 1980s with her portrayal of Christine Daae in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" Her 11th solo album, Dreamchaser, was released in 2013.      ANALYSIS: Singer Sarah Brightman Headed to Orbit?      A long-time space buff, Brightman announced in 2012 that she intended to travel as a \\"spaceflight participant\\" to the station, an orbital research complex that flies about 260 miles above Earth.      Virginia-based Space Adventures is arranging the trip, which is estimated to cost about 52 million.      Brightman will become the seventh paying tourist to visit the station. The last non-astronaut to make the trip was Cirque du Soleil founder and chief executive Guy Laliberte in September 2009. [The First Space Tourists (A Photo Timeline)]      Microsoft co-founder Charles Simonyi is the only tourist to have visited twice.      PHOTOS: Epic Aurora Photos From the Space Station      With NASA's space shuttles retired, all available seats on Russian Soyuz capsules — currently the only transportation system flying people to the station — have been needed to ferry crewmembers. A seat will become available in 2015 because two station crewmembers will be participating in an experimental year-long flight.      Brightman also has booked a suborbital space ride aboard Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, which is undergoing testing in California’s Mojave Desert. Commercial passenger service is expected to begin next year.      Waiting in the wings for another Soyuz ride to the station is Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who has an option to fly on the next available seat, most likely in 2017, Space Adventures president Tom Shelley said at a National Space Club Florida Committee meeting in June.      ANALYSIS: Singer Sarah Brightman Signs Up for Space Trip      NASA is working with three companies to develop commercial space taxis, in hopes of breaking Russia’s monopoly before the end of 2017. Space Adventures has an exclusive agreement with one of the contenders, Boeing, to sell rides to privately paying passengers aboard its CST-100 capsules.      Shelley said the price should be less than the current 52 million it costs to ride on a Soyuz.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President). The state's U.S. Senate seats... A:","output":"The current name of the third-party movement that was able to elect Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998 is the Independence Party of Minnesota. It was formerly known as the Reform Party, but changed its name to better reflect its political platform and goals. The Independence Party has been able to garner significant support in various elections, allowing it to maintain its major-party status in Minnesota. This status grants the party state funding for elections, as long as its candidates consistently receive at least five percent of the vote in statewide elections. The origins of the Independence Party can be traced back to the foundation of the Reform Party, which was established in the 1990s by Texas billionaire Ross Perot as part of his bid for the U.S. presidency. The party experienced some initial success at the national level, but its influence gradually waned over time. In Minnesota, however, the party experienced renewed vigor when Jesse Ventura, a former mayor and professional wrestler, decided to join the movement and ultimately won the 1998 gubernatorial election. His victory brought significant attention to the party and boosted its profile in Minnesota politics. Despite Ventura's success, the Independence Party has struggled in more recent elections to replicate its earlier achievements. Nonetheless, it still manages to exert influence in Minnesota politics and maintains its major-party status. The party's ideology emphasizes political independent thinking, fiscal responsibility, and government reform, and it seeks to provide voters with an alternative to the more established Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and Republican Party. While the Green Party has lost its major-party status in Minnesota, it continues to maintain a large presence in municipal government, particularly in cities such as Minneapolis and Duluth. In these areas, the Green Party competes directly with the DFL for local offices, demonstrating that third-party movements still play an important role in shaping Minnesota's political landscape.  Overall, the Independence Party of Minnesota is the current name of the third-party movement that successfully elected Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. Although the party may not have replicated its past successes, it remains an influential force in the state's politics and continues to provide an alternative voice for voters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the last name of the person whose wife Irina was later told he had been blackmailed?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The year 1960 marked another turning point in Shostakovich's life: he joined the Communist Party. The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"...

Question: Article: Scientists have searched for many years for a method to tell whether a volcano explosion will be small or large. Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.  Mount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today.  The scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones.  The scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives.

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife.

Summarize this article: WASHINGTON — BY all outward indications, the U.S. Navy Veterans Association was a leader in the charitable community. Founded in 2002 to provide support to Navy veterans in need, the charity recorded astonishing financial success. In its first eight years, it raised around 100 million in charitable contributions, almost all of it through a direct marketing campaign. The organization, headed by Jack L. Nimitz, boasted of 41 state chapters and some 66,000 members.      This would be a great story of charitable success, except for the fact that virtually everything about the association turned out to be false: no state chapters, no members, no leader with the name redolent of naval history. Instead, there was one guy: a man calling himself Bobby Thompson who worked from a duplex across the street from the Cuesta-Rey cigar factory in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa.      But the money raised was real enough, generated by a series of for-profit telemarketers. The victims, by and large, were unsuspecting small-money donors who received urgent solicitations asking for support for needy naval veterans. Most of the money raised stayed with the fund-raisers, though plenty apparently dripped through to Mr. Thompson and a succession of Republican lawmakers who received generous contributions from the association’s political arm. But little ever made it to the intended beneficiaries. In 2010, the scheme was unwound by two reporters for what is now The Tampa Bay Times, but not before Mr. Thompson had fled the state of Florida.      From June 2010, Mr. Thompson was on the run, the search for him hamstrung by the fact that no one had any real idea of who he was. Finally, on April 30, 2012, federal marshals tracked him down in Portland, Ore., finding him with a card to a storage unit containing 981,650 in cash and almost two dozen fake identity cards.      Earlier this month in Ohio, where the charity’s registration documents had been filed, the man arrested as Bobby Thompson was convicted on 23 felony counts, including fraud, theft and money laundering. Authorities have identified him as John Donald Cody, a former Army intelligence officer and Harvard Law graduate. Given its sensational facts, the case has drawn more attention than your average matter in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. But the story is worth paying attention to for a more important reason, if we want to prevent more Bobby Thompsons in our future.      The most outrageous aspect of the case is that much of what Mr. Cody did was probably legal, or at least not specifically illegal. The principal beneficiaries were always the association’s for-profit fund-raisers. During the trial, one of them, Thomas Berkenbush of Community Support Inc., testified, apparently without fear of legal repercussions, that his company had kept 90 percent of the donations as a fund-raising charge.      That, in and of itself, isn’t criminal. The alleged fraud was not that very, very little money ever went to Navy veterans. In fact, the fund-raising explicitly stated that a large portion of donations would go to cover telemarketing and other costs. Mr. Cody ran afoul of the law because he filed registration documents that contained false statements, because he stole the identity of the real Bobby Thompson, and because he pulled money from organizational accounts for his personal use. The irony is that he could have accomplished virtually his entire enrichment scheme without ever violating the law — and others have figured that out.      The I.R.S.’s Exempt Organizations Division, which is responsible for supervising the charitable sector, is chronically understaffed. It can’t do much more than process the routine and voluminous reporting of the more than 1.5 million American nonprofits, and keep up with the tens of thousands of applications filed each year to start new charities.      State and local authorities are in no better shape. Joel L. Fleishman, a professor of public policy at Duke, estimates that there are fewer than 100 full-time state charity regulators, far too few to exercise any real oversight.      In the Navy Veterans case, amazingly, the I.R.S. did undertake one of its rare field audits. And yet, despite the fact that the main office was a trailer, its state offices were empty lots or postal drops, and its board of directors and C.E.O. a total fiction, the I.R.S. in 2008 gave the association a “clean bill of health.” It wasn’t until the two reporters came sniffing — first curious about the political contributions and subsequently intrigued by Mr. Thompson’s obvious dissembling — that the real story began to emerge.      When it comes to frauds like these, it is neither the law nor the regulators that are the best line of defense; it will always be the careful application of caveat emptor by potential donors. This isn’t easy: there are approximately 59,000 charities in this country with the word “veterans” in their names. Only a few people can claim the expertise to say which are the best, let alone which are trustworthy.      As we enter the annual giving season, donors should look to sources like the GiveWell website to find organizations with a track record of effectiveness. Seeking them out — instead of donating to charities that are first to call or that sound familiar or that we’ve heard are good — is the only way to ensure that money reaches those in need. ||||| Our Top Charities      We recommend few charities by design, because we see ourselves as a finder of great giving opportunities rather than a charity evaluator.

Historians such as Richard S. Westfall have argued that the overt traditionalism of universities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists.

If either eye repeatedly displays signs of marijuana abuse, consider seeing your doctor, a psychiatrist, or a trained mental health professional. If bloodshot eyes are a severe symptom of marijuana use, such as feeling or feeling dizzy and moving quickly, then contact your doctor or therapist.; II. Skip the second eye altogether if you suspect the person has been using marijuana. Of course, if your friend shows a glassy, bulging eye, your friend may have marijuana.; III. Red eyes can also be caused by any number of other things, including : Allergies illness (such as a common cold) lack of sleep recent crying irritants in the eyes excessive sun exposure Watch for signs of dizziness.

The correct answer is option III because it acknowledges that red or bloodshot eyes can be caused by various factors, not just marijuana use. Additionally, it provides another possible symptom of marijuana use: dizziness or a lack of coordination. Option I is incorrect because it suggests seeking a doctor or therapist based on bloodshot eyes alone, which can be caused by a variety of factors unrelated to marijuana use. It also mentions irrelevant details and confuses terms like severe symptoms and feelings. Option II is incorrect because it suggests skipping the second eye altogether when checking for bloodshot eyes. Bloodshot eyes should be checked in both eyes, and the presence of a single glassy or bulging eye would not necessarily indicate marijuana use. Option IV is incorrect because its content is unclear and confusing. It suggests that the presence of bloodshot eyes without marijuana use implies marijuana use, which is contradictory and doesn't make sense.

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.

A young and naive Englishman, John Truscott, goes to the British colony of Sarawak, Borneo, to try to apply his father's work to the Iban society. There he meets his boss Henry Bullard and his wife Aggie Bullard. John tries to civilize them, building schools and providing education for the Iban people. He is met with unfamiliar local customs. Selima becomes his \\"sleeping dictionary\\", who sleeps with him and teaches him the language and the habits of the locals. John is sent up river where a sickness is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans. He notices that the Yakata have rice – which has been given to them by the miners – and he guesses correctly that the miners have poisoned the rice in order to get rid of the Yakata. Knowing that they will exact vengeance, John tells the Yakata what has happened. The Yakata wipe out the miners. Despite their intents, the two find themselves falling into a forbidden love. John is eager to marry Selima despite the longhouse not allowing it. When John tells Henry about his plans to marry her, they lock Selima up. Selima then agrees to marry in the longhouse and they part ways. Bullard threatens to send him to trial for the death of the European miners. He makes a deal with John.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. walk opposite right and run opposite right thrice","output":"To execute the given command, we break it down into the sequence of actions as follows: 1. \\"walk opposite right\\": To walk opposite right, the agent needs to turn around 180 degrees in the right direction, and then walk.

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \\"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and no law, and had no fear of eternal consequences, they were far more likely to disrupt society. Bayle (1647–1706) observed that in his day, \\"prudent persons will always maintain an appearance of [religion].\\". He believed that even atheists could hold concepts of honor and go beyond their own self-interest to create and interact in society. Locke said that if there were no God and no divine law, the result would be moral anarchy: every individual \\"could have no law but his own will, no end but himself. He would be a god to himself, and the satisfaction of his own will the sole measure and end of all his actions\\".

The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track \\"Wrestlers\\" started taking a new direction because the band was \\"wrestling with the idea of making an R. Kelly kind of slick R and B number\\" and ultimately \\"[sounded] more like Randy Newman's \\"Short People\\". He said, \\"if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for the fact that there are more ballads on this record than any other record.\\" Taylor said that feelings of happiness and love influenced the album's romantic feel.Goddard considered varying styles and influences a key factor in the band's music. He explained to The Sun that creating music could be difficult because a member could introduce a different influence. Goddard and Doyle said that clashes and restlessness during recording led to \\"unpleasant\\" periods of silence, but ultimately thought the clashes created \\"something more interesting because you have these different voices and not one person dictating\\".Martin told The Georgia Straight that the group are \\"afflicted with something akin to musical attention-deficit disorder\\" and said that the group \\"get bored quite easily [...] with [their] own records at times\\".

This is the lowest you can go in the world, and will help you know how deep you are when you're mining. Diamond ore is typically found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8.  Never, ever dig straight down, as you don't know what is underneath those blocks. You might fall into a dungeon or a pool of lava. Once you hit bedrock, go back up until you're around level 8 and start your mine. Dig a central room about 2 blocks tall, 4 blocks long, and 4 blocks high.  Some players like to start the mine around layer 11. This will result in a slightly smaller chance of finding diamonds, but you are less likely to tunnel directly into a lava pit this way. Remember, diamonds usually spawn near lava. It is recommended that you create a chest in the central room of your mine so that you have a place to store excess ore as you build the mine. Dig a corridor 2 blocks high and at least 50 blocks long in each direction. These will be your starting branches. Walk down one of your corridors and start mining to the left and right every six blocks. This will maximize your efficiency the amount of blocks you can see as you mine. Diamonds are one of the rarest things in the game to find, E, and occur in less than 1% of the blocks in the lower levels. Finding diamonds is more of a game of luck than anything else, and patience is the most important thing to have when mining for them.  If you are lazy and don't want to do this much work, set off some TNT or craft the Wither. But it's best to go into Survival Mode before setting of any explosives. Also, using explosives can shorten your time mining but you might destroy some valuable ores like gold ores or the diamond ores you came for.(The Wither destroys any blocks in its way.) Summary:","output":"To efficiently mine for diamonds in Minecraft, first locate a good cave system and descend until reaching bedrock, the lowest point in the game world. Diamond ores are commonly found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8. Avoid digging straight down to prevent falling into dangerous areas. Once bedrock is reached, ascend to around layer 8 (or layer 11 for less risk of encountering lava) and start the mine.  Create a central room measuring 2 blocks tall, 4 blocks long, and 4 blocks wide, and place a chest for storing excess ore. Extend a 2-block high corridor at least 50 blocks long in each direction to begin branch mining. As you progress down each corridor, mine to the left and right every six blocks to increase efficiency and visibility of potential diamond ores.  Although diamond ores are rare, constituting less than 1% of blocks in lower levels, patience and perseverance are key for successful mining. An alternative, albeit risky, method involves using TNT or crafting the Wither to access diamond ores, but this may destroy valuable resources.

Process:  - Energy builds up in the crust of the earth - The energy causes the fault lines give way - The earth&#x27;s plates move - The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions - The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there was normal movement of tectonic plates happens, how will it affect crust is pushed forward.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the proposed perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of energy buildup and release in the Earth's crust. Direct Effects: 1. The normal movement of tectonic plates is primarily driven by forces originating from the mantle, such as convection currents. These forces can cause stress and strain to accumulate in the crust, particularly along fault lines. If a perturbation alters the normal tectonic movement, it may lead to an increase or decrease in the rate of stress accumulation, thus affecting the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes.     2. If the perturbation causes the plates to move faster or at different angles than usual, it may change the way the crust is pushed or pulled at plate boundaries. This could directly influence the occurrence of earthquakes by either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of ruptures along fault lines. Indirect Effects: 1. Perturbations in normal tectonic plate movement can affect geological processes such as volcanic activity, which, in turn, can impact the stress field in the Earth's crust. For example, eruptions can release pressure within the Earth, thereby reducing stress along nearby fault lines and potentially altering earthquake patterns in the surrounding regions. 2. Changes in tectonic plate movement can also lead to the formation of new stresses in the crust due to the complex interactions between different parts of the lithosphere. These new stress fields might trigger instabilities along existing or newly-formed fault lines, thereby influencing the occurrence and distribution of earthquakes. 3. Moreover, perturbations in tectonic plate movement can influence other Earth systems, such as climate, sea level, and ocean circulation patterns. These changes may indirectly affect earthquakes through various feedback mechanisms. For instance, changes in sea level can influence the amount of stress on the Earth's crust by altering the weight distribution, which may, in turn, affect the likelihood of earthquakes. Overall, the supposition of a perturbation in normal tectonic plate movement can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of energy buildup and release in the Earth's crust, leading to potential changes in the occurrence, distribution, and magnitude of earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Taylor is no stranger to The Posh, having previously played for the club from 2011 to 2012. Background on Paul Taylor's Career: Born on 4th November 1987 in Liverpool, Paul Taylor began his football career playing for Vauxhall Motors before being signed by Chester City in the summer of 2008. Despite facing some challenges initially, the young striker found his groove and displayed his potential as a forward. In August 2011, he signed with Peterborough United, where he scored 12 goals in 48 appearances. His stint at the club attracted the attention of Ipswich Town, who signed him on a permanent deal in August 2012. Taylor struggled to find his footing with Ipswich Town, only managing 27 appearances and one goal during his two-year spell with the club. He also experienced loan spells at Rotherham United, Crawley Town, and Gillingham before moving on to play for clubs like Bradford City, Doncaster Rovers, and Tranmere Rovers. During his initial time at Peterborough United, Taylor made a significant impact with his goal scoring capability and creativity up front. Unfortunately, inconsistencies and missed opportunities led to Taylor's career experiencing a slow decline over the years. In 2020, Taylor decided to take a break from professional football for personal reasons. Peterborough United's Statement on Paul Taylor: In a recent official statement, Peterborough United confirmed Taylor's return and expressed their excitement to have him back. \\"We're thrilled to announce the return of Paul Taylor to the club. He's an experienced and talented player who has shown a significant commitment to getting back to full fitness and proving his worth on the pitch.\\" Peterborough United Manager, Darren Ferguson, echoed the sentiment, stating, \\"It's great to have Paul back at the club. He has always been an exceptional talent, and we believe he still has plenty to offer. We're confident that with the right support and guidance, Paul can be a valuable asset to our team for the upcoming season.\\" Fan Reactions and Expectations: As news of Paul Taylor's return to Peterborough United spread, fans showed mixed reactions on social media. Many expressed joy at the forward's return, reminiscing about his previous performances under the blue and white colors of The Posh. However, some fans expressed concerns over Taylor's age and recent form, questioning if the signing is a wise move. Regardless of these concerns, Peterborough United management is hopeful that Taylor's return will provide ample depth upfront to complement the likes of top goal-scorer Jonson Clarke-Harris. With an ambitious goal of securing promotion to the Championship, the club is determined to make the 2021-2022 League One season one to remember. Conclusion: Paul Taylor's return to professional football and Peterborough United offers the forward a chance to reignite his career and contribute to the club's promotion ambitions. It remains to be seen how Taylor will fare in League One this season, but his re-signing with Peterborough United is undoubtedly a newsworthy event. Football fans nationwide will keep a watchful eye on the forward as he steps back on the pitch, chasing his goals and dreams once again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN)A Polish prosecutor on Tuesday asked a regional court in Krakow to consider whether to extradite famed film director Roman Polanski to the United States, where he is wanted for having sex with a minor in the 1970s. \\"Further procedures in this case will be made by the court in Krakow,\\" the regional prosecutor's office in Krakow said in a statement Tuesday. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the court could take several weeks to reach a decision. U.S. officials have repeatedly tried to bring Polanski back to the United States to face sentencing in the decades-old case. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 in California to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13. Polanski was 43 at the time. Tuesday's move by the Krakow prosecutor comes three months after OPTIONS: - CNN authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - California authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Krakow authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Mateusz Martyniuk authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Polanski authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Polish authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Roman Polanski authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - Samantha Geimer authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - U.S. authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. - United States authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview.","output":"Tuesday's move by the Krakow prosecutor comes three months after Polish authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. Polanski has been a fugitive from the American justice system since 1978 when he fled the United States prior to his sentencing. After leaving the U.S., Polanski continued working and gained international recognition for his films such as \\"Tess\\" (1979), \\"The Pianist\\" (2002), and \\"Carnage\\" (2011). Despite his success, the warrant for his arrest has cast a shadow over his career and limited his ability to travel and attend award ceremonies and film festivals. The case has sparked a complex legal saga that spans multiple countries and spans over four decades. In 2009, Swiss authorities arrested Polanski on behalf of the United States but ultimately decided against extradition, releasing him from house arrest in 2010. In 2015, Polish courts also rejected a U.S. extradition request, ruling that Polanski had already served sufficient jail time and had undergone rehabilitation. To date, Polanski has successfully evaded extradition to the United States, where he would face sentencing for his unlawful actions towards Samantha Geimer. However, the debate continues over whether Polanski should be extradited to face the American justice system for his decades-old crime or if the time he has already served is sufficient punishment. The decision by the Krakow court on whether to extradite Roman Polanski will be closely watched by both his supporters and detractors around the world. Some argue that his artistic accomplishments should not excuse him from facing the legal consequences of his actions, while others contend that he has already suffered enough consequences in his personal and professional life. As the saga unfolds, this case continues to raise questions about the balance between artistic freedom and the pursuit of justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As extreme weather becomes more prevalent and temperatures continue to rise, crops are predicted to fail in many regions worldwide. Experts have predicted that this could lead to severe price spikes and widespread famine. Consequently, in certain areas with warmer temperatures, pest populations are set to multiply, contributing to the crop yield loss. Also, water scarcity in some regions presents an additional danger to agriculture. Unless swift action is taken, the knock-on effects of these factors could have far-reaching, catastrophic consequences. Governments and individuals must take an active role in addressing this issue. Accelerated climate action, better land management practices, and investment in new farming technologies are essential steps in mitigating the impacts on food production. Scientists are already developing novel approaches to counteract the effects of climate change, such as drought-resilient crops, vertical farming, conservation agriculture, and sustainable land management through agroforestry. Funding for agricultural research must also be a top priority for governments and the private sector. Additionally, more responsible land and water management approaches, such as reducing food waste, protecting natural habitats and groundwater, and enhancing soil health are necessary. Overall, the looming crisis of food scarcity due to climate change can only be tackled by a continuous, concerted effort by all stakeholders. We must implement new and better ways of growing and distributing food and create a more sustainable food system. By investing in innovative technologies and better, environmentally sensitive practices, we can build a more resilient food supply chain for future generations."},{"instruction":"Write a dialog with this premise Nina lost her phone at the beach.

Simplified welfare systems: A basic income can be simpler than the current system of welfare programs that provide a patchwork of benefits for different circumstances, saving time and resources for both individuals and the government. 4. Reduced stigma: Universal basic income would likely reduce the stigma associated with receiving government assistance, as everyone would be given the same basic income, regardless of their circumstances. Drawbacks: 1. Cost: Funding a basic income would require significant financial resources from governments, which could be difficult to find, particularly if it involves diverting funds from existing programs. 2. Disincentives to work: If people receive a basic income that covers their basic needs, they may feel less motivated to work, which could reduce productivity and harm the economy. 3. Inflation: If everyone has increased buying power, prices may rise, reducing the value of the basic income and potentially leading to inflation. 4.

Additionally, studies have shown that the death penalty does not effectively deter crime, and that it is applied disproportionately to people of color and those with lower incomes. There is also the risk of executing innocent individuals or individuals who are mentally ill.

Show your work and explain the meaning of the derivative in this context.","output":"Answer: The derivative of f(x) = sin(x) is f'(x) = cos(x). Explanation: To find the derivative of f(x) = sin(x), we need to use the chain rule. Let u = x and y = sin(u), so f(x) = y. Then, f'(x) = dy/du * du/dx = cos(u) * 1 (since du/dx = 1 and dy/du = cos(u)) = cos(x) The derivative of sin(x) is therefore cos(x). In this context, the derivative of sin(x) represents the rate of change of the function at any given point x. This means that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of sin(x) at x is equal to cos(x). Furthermore, the value of cos(x) tells us whether sin(x) is increasing or decreasing at x. If cos(x) is positive, then sin(x) is increasing at x; if cos(x) is negative, then sin(x) is decreasing at x."},{"instruction":"Create a story that ends with this sentence.
