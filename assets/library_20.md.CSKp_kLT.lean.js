Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister Nayrok alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. To provide for her family, the children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King. In May 2013, Badu announced she was writing her next project, but not placing a time constraint on it. In July 2014, Badu revealed she was still working on the album and had been recording in April in Africa where she was \\"laying down drum tracks\\". Badu also said that prior to her trip to Africa she would have meetings with her record label to set a deadline for the album. Later that year Badu expanded on the album, stating she was working with producer Flying Lotus, who she met via MySpace years ago; they later met in L.A. at guitarist Steve Wilson's house. In 2015 Badu appeared on \\"Rememory\\", a song from Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment's album Surf. In July 2015, Badu released a free mixtape of her favorite recordings, describing the set as \\"carefully and lovingly selected high frequency tones for the soul.\\" The mixtape features mostly vintage funk, soul and jazz songs. On March 26, 2015, Erykah Badu performed at The Bomb Factory in her hometown, Dallas, Texas, for the Deep Ellum venue's grand opening. The sold-out show also featured fellow Dallas native, singer-songwriter Sarah Jaffe.  In early October, Badu released a remix of Drake's single \\"Hotline Bling\\", and later released a mixtape, But You Caint Use My Phone, on November 27, 2015, making it available for digital download and streaming exclusively through Apple Music. After one week of exclusive release on iTunes, But You Caint Use My Phone was released to other digital retailers and streaming services on December 4, 2015. The mixtape was released without the knowledge of her label Universal, due to Badu sending the record straight to iTunes. It also marked Badu's first release under her own record label, Control Freaq. But You Caint Use My Phone received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Badu also hosted the 2015, 2016 and the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards.  Badu held her annual \\"Still Boomin'\\" sold-out birthday bash concert at The Bomb Factory on February 26, 2016, marking her second performance at the venue since its grand opening 11 months earlier. The event was hosted by Badu's close friend Dave Chappelle and featured a surprise appearance by Outkast frontman Andre 3000. Badu enlisted Dallas local hip hop acts -topic, Zach Witness, and Cameron McCloud as her supporting acts.

He said that what made him happy was doing things for others, and that doing so gave him a nice feeling inside. However, no one really believed him, they thought he was silly. He spent all day helping others, dispensing  charity to the poorest, and looking after abandoned animals. Very seldom did he ever do anything for himself. One day, he met a famous doctor who thought the boy's case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him. So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising. Each time the boy did something good, a thousand tiny angels gathered around the boy's heart and started tickling it. That explained the boy's happiness, but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us. Unfortunately, he found that, as we do so few good things, the angels spend most of their time wandering about, bored. And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered. Thanks to that little boy we now know exactly what we have to do to feel our hearts being tickled.   Question: All of the following words can be used to describe the boy EXCEPT_.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who is the most at risk for exploitation under their current rules?\\" is in \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\".

Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Certainly. The most at-risk group for exploitation under the current rules of Jehovah's Witnesses are children who experience sexual abuse within the organization. This is due to the religion's \\"two witness rule\\" which requires secondary evidence to substantiate cases of sexual abuse. If the accused person denies wrongdoing and there is no corroboration, the matter is left in Jehovah's hands, potentially allowing the abuse to continue without intervention. Critics argue that this policy protects the perpetrators rather than the victims, as having another witness to an act of molestation is highly unlikely. Jehovah's Witnesses assert that they have a strong policy to protect children, focusing on educating parents and not sponsoring events that separate children from their parents.

Whoever wins the polls in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh will, for the next five years, rule a population that's larger than the combined size of Britain, France, Germany and Sweden. The stakes are high and in their desperation to grab the eyeballs of the 222 million plus people, some of India's top politicians are indulging in mudslinging and name calling, some of which are very, well, creative. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi compiles a list of bizarre barbs and rants the political leaders are throwing at each other. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at an election rally in Fatehpur took a macabre turn when he brought up graveyards and cremation grounds. \\"If land is given for a cemetery in a village, it should also be given for a cremation ground. If there's electricity during Ramadan, it should be supplied during Diwali too. If there's electricity on Holi, it should be there on Eid also. There should be no discrimination,\\" he said. The comment was meant to be a criticism of the state government led by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav whom Mr Modi has accused of trying to appease the Muslim minority community. But it was played and replayed on television news channels with his political rivals and many commentators accusing the prime minister of trying to divide voters along religious lines. His supporters defended him - they said his speech was misunderstood and all that he was trying to say was that discrimination must end. For those not familiar with the Uttar Pradesh politics, they would be forgiven if they walked into a rally of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and thought they had stumbled into a conference about animals. The elephant has been a recurring theme at his election rallies from day one. The pachyderm is the election symbol of his biggest regional rival, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), led by Dalit icon Mayawati who is a four-time chief minister of the state. During her last term in power from 2002 to 2007, Ms Mayawati spent more than a billion dollars building concrete parks where scores of elephant statues were erected. \\"For seven years, I've been watching these elephants. Those which were sitting, are still sitting. And those which were standing, are still standing,\\" Mr Yadav says at every election rally, pointing out the \\"wasteful expenditure\\". But on Monday, he mentioned a new animal - the donkey. Without naming anyone, he talked about an advertisement by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan to promote a Wild Ass Sanctuary in Gujarat, the prime minister's home state. \\"I request the century's biggest superstar, please don't do any ad campaigns for Gujarat's gadhas (donkeys),\\" he said. His comments were immediately described as an \\"outrageous dig\\" at PM Modi with many wondering if the public discourse could get any more pungent. Well, on Tuesday, it did - when colourful politician Laloo Yadav called BJP chief Amit Shah a genda (rhinoceros). Post script: He also called PM Modi a eunuch. In this season of name calling, Ms Mayawati, popularly known as Behenji (Hindi for older sister), also has a new name for Mr Modi. An icon to millions of Dalits (formerly untouchables), she said the initials in his name Narendra Damodardas Modi actually stood for \\"Mr Negative Dalit Man\\". \\"I have defined the prime minister's name taking into consideration his work, behaviour and policy,\\" she said. The name game, however, was started by Mr Modi who earlier said that her Bahujan Samaj Party, which loosely translates as \\"party of the majority of people\\", has turned into the Behenji Sampatti Party (Behenji Assets party). Ms Mayawati said Mr Modi was \\"indulging in cheap things and petty talk\\" because he was \\"perturbed by the rising popularity of her party\\". India's Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti, who is campaigning for PM Modi's BJP, recently told a gathering in the backward Bundelkhand region that [Donald] Trump and [Vladimir] Putin were watching the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections. According to a report in The Indian Express Ms Bharti said: \\"Trump and Putin are watching; that if India has to become a great power then UP should not be backward.\\" She also invoked the names of [Karl] Marx and [Vladimir] Lenin while praising the recent government decision to ban high value currency notes to curb corruption. \\"One of the biggest economic revolutions in the world was brought about by Marx and Lenin. But their revolution was a bloody one. The one that PM Narendra Modi has brought through demonetisation is a bloodless economic revolution.\\" Now, Bundelkhand is among the most backward regions in the state and people here are barely literate. No wonder then, as the Express reported, \\"Her references to Marx, Lenin, Trump and Putin left many flummoxed in the crowd\\". And us too. What is a summary of this text?","output":"India's political parties have engaged in a war of words during the electoral campaign in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. At stake is governance of a population larger than the combined size of Britain, France, Germany, and Sweden for the next five years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians have been hurling insults at one another, with accusations of discrimination, wasteful expenditure, and even comments about each other's names being brought to the table.

A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum.  - Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.  - A Time Out of War is a 1954 American short war film directed by Denis Sanders. It won an Academy Award in 1955 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel), first prize at the Venice Film Festival Live Action Short Film category, and a special BAFTA Award.  - Sydney Irwin Pollack (July 1, 1934  May 26, 2008) was an American film director, producer and actor. Pollack directed more than 20 films and 10 television shows, acted in over 30 films or shows, and produced over 44 films. His 1985 film \\"Out of Africa\\" won him Academy Awards for directing and producing; he was also nominated for Best Director Oscars for \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\\" (1969) and \\"Tootsie\\" (1982), in the latter of which he also appeared.  - Direct-to-video or straight-to-video (also known as direct-to-VHS, direct-to-DVD, direct-to-Blu-ray, direct-to-digital, etc.) refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast. Because inferior sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.  - Charles Robert Redford Jr. (born August 18, 1936) is an American actor, director, producer, businessman, environmentalist, and philanthropist. Redford is the founder of the Sundance Film Festival.  - War Hunt is a 1962 war film starring John Saxon, Robert Redford and Charles Aidman. The film was directed by Denis Sanders, produced by his brother, Terry Sanders for T-D Enterprises, and released by United Artists.  - The American Film Foundation is an award-winning production company based in Southern California. The foundation is headed by Terry Sanders and Freida Lee Mock who have combined to create more than 60 documentary and feature films.

What is product market fit? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are related, as they both involve product-market fit, but they are distinct in what they inquire about. Let me explain each question and their relationship. The first question: \\"No product-market fit: change product or market first?\\" This question is asking for advice on which element to modify first when a product is not fitting into the market or, in other words, is not meeting consumer demand. The query is asking for an opinion on whether it is more strategic to adjust the product to better match the market or to choose a different market to target with the product. The implication here is that there might be a mismatch between the product's value proposition and the market's needs or preferences, and changing one of the two elements might solve this issue. Deciding whether to change the product or the market first depends on many factors, such as the competition, the product's strengths or weaknesses, and the potential of other markets. The second question: \\"What is product market fit?\\" This question is asking for a definition of product-market fit. Product-market fit refers to the situation where a product successfully fulfills a large and sustainable demand in its target market. In other words, the product's value proposition appeals to, and resonates with, a sufficient number of consumers or businesses within a particular market. Achieving product-market fit is an essential milestone for startups and businesses, as it signifies that they have found a scalable and profitable business model. In summary, the two questions are connected in that they both address product-market fit, but they are different in focus. While the first question is about the strategies for rectifying an absence of product-market fit (changing product or market), the second question asks for an explanation of the term itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options:  A. front door  B. residence  C. zoo  D. restaurant  E. barn","output":"The most logical option in line with common sense for someone to find and see a big cat would be Option C: zoo.  A zoo is a facility where various types of wild animals are kept in captivity for visitors to observe and learn about them in a controlled environment. Zoos often have a variety of large cat species such as lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars, which could satisfy someone's desire to see a big cat up close. Option A, the front door, might occasionally provide a view of domestic cats or small wild cats, but it is highly improbable to find a large cat, such as a lion or tiger, casually wandering outside one's front door. Option B, the residence, is also an unlikely place to find a large cat like a lion or a tiger, unless the individual in question happens to live in an unconventional location like a sanctuary or wildlife reserve, which is not typical. Option D, the restaurant, is not an appropriate setting for encountering large, wild cats. It might be a place for enjoying a meal and socializing, but it is highly unlikely that a big cat would be present in such a location. Option E, the barn, may contain domestic farm animals such as cows, pigs, and goats, but it is also not a fitting place to come across a large cat species like lions or tigers.  In conclusion, out of the given options, it would make the most sense for someone to visit a zoo if they wish to see a big cat in a safe and controlled environment. Zoos are dedicated spaces for displaying and conserving wildlife, making it the most logical and suitable destination for this purpose."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Suddenly, we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before. Since he left so young, and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode, but no, Daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way. The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping, but the conductor has no desire to go back to music. Daniel begins to explore his new universe. The town's people leave him alone. He makes an impression on Lena, who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies. Little by little, he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir. Lena will ultimately fall in love with Daniel. At first, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected. As they get to know him better, they come around to accept him and make him one of them. His new position doesn't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge. The members of the choir are a motley crew, but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece composed for Gabriella, a battered wife, makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers. Daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig's own. The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife, Siv. His ideas clash with the dogma, as Siv points to him. Stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of Daniel by firing him as the head of the choir. The choir, which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria. Daniel, who by now has fallen totally for Lena, has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship.

Context: The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.

It can be difficult to tell for sure whether or not a cat is feral or simply adventuring away from home.  Both lost pet cats and feral cats may behave aggressively toward you or run off out of fear when you approach, so determining that a cat is feral may require subtle cues.  Feral cats may appear to be better groomed than a lost pet cat that hasn’t gotten accustomed to living outdoors yet. If you start feeding the cat, pet cats will grow to trust you and behave like a pet whereas feral cats will remain skittish. Feral cats have existed around humans for thousands of years, and often don’t require any assistance from people to survive.  These cats are not really homeless, they’re wild animals.  Feral cats are not socialized to people, so they cannot be adopted as pets easily. Feral cats often live in social groups called colonies.  If you see one, there are likely a number of other feral cats in the area. Feral cats probably do not need your help unless it appears sickly or weak. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a phrase used to describe a common population control method utilized with feral cats.  TNR can improve a cat’s health, the health of its colony, and prevent an overpopulation of feral cats that could lead to some cats starving.  After a feral cat has been vaccinated and neutered it can be adopted or returned to the area it was trapped.  First, contact your local vet or animal shelter.  They may offer TNR services for the community free of charge or for a reduced cost.  They also may be able to offer assistance and traps. Next, you’ll need to safely Trap a Feral Cat. Negative behaviors associated with mating such as fighting and yowling stop after the cat has been neutered. After treatment the vet will help you determine if the cat should be re-released or put up for adoption. If a feral cat appears to be injured or sick, you may choose to help the cat regain its health.  Remember that feral cats are wild animals, so the injury could make it aggressive.  Also remember to keep your own health in mind when dealing with feral cats, especially ones that seem ill.  Make sure to wash your hands after coming into contact with a feral cat.  If the cat appears to simply be malnourished, do not attempt to bring it inside, but consider leaving food and water out for the cat to eat and drink when you aren’t around and it feels more comfortable. If the cat seems seriously ill or injured, do not approach it.  Either entice the cat into a carrier or cage with food or place it there gently if it is not moving, then bring the cat to a local animal hospital for treatment.  There are many shelters and animal hospitals that will care for stray cats at reduced or no cost.  You can also call animal control in your town if you would rather not approach the animal yourself.

(Foto: Omar Torres / Getty Images) México - Juan Francisco Palencia hizo oficial hoy su retiro de las canchas y dijo que es una decisión perfectamente bien planteada y bien pensada y que no hay vuelta atrás. En conferencia de prensa, en el auditorio de las instalaciones del club en La Cantera, el ahora ex jugador explicó que va a estar fuera del país por un tiempo para disfrutar de su familia y que por el momento no tiene pensado estar en el banquillo de algún equipo, sino que quiere preparase de la mejor forma y en un futuro dirigir a Pumas de la UNAM. \\"Quiero descansar un poco, del mucho tiempo que llevo jugando, haciendo cosas para aprender, pues en este momento no estoy preparado para estar en un banquillo, quiero seguirme preparado para eso, pero en este momento no, quizá a futuro que esté más preparado, esa es mi intención\\". Palencia, se mostró sereno a lo largo de la conferencia y solamente estuvo a punto de que le ganara la emoción, en el momento de explicar cómo fue su despedida con el resto de sus ahora ex compañeros. El jugador dijo que se va contento por haber realizado todo lo que un futbolista puede hacer en este deporte, el futbol que le dio tanto y se dijo agradecido con la vida por esta oportunidad de jugar, a la directiva universitaria, a su familia, a sus compañeros y amigos, así como de los medios de información. \\"Me voy contento porque en toda mi carrera, pude realizar lo que todo futbolista puede hacer, conseguir tres títulos, dos de ellos con Pumas, jugar fuera, una Libertadores, un Mundial, una Confederaciones, pero retirarme con Pumas es un privilegio para mí\\". Francisco Palencia explicó que su retiro comenzó a pensarlo en los últimos torneos, cuando el cuerpo y todo su ser le comenzó a decir que ya era momento de dejar el futbol, que tantos privilegios le ha dado. \\"Sé cuando llega el día del retiro, mi corazón, mi cuerpo y mi mente me dictan y vi señales estos últimos torneos que me decían, que ya era hora (tiene 38 años), esa fue la principal razón que me llevó a tomar la decisión\\". \\"Me voy fuera de mi país, no a entrenar ni a ningún club, sino que voy a disfrutar de mi familia, convivir con mis hijos y seguirme preparando, ver entrenamientos de otros equipos de México y el futbol internacional y en futuro prepararme bien como técnico\\". Cabe señalar que Palencia tiene un negocio (restaurant) en Barcelona a donde viajará con su esposa que es valenciana y sin duda buscará estar más tiempo con ella y el negocio. Cuestionado sobre si aceptaría un partido de homenaje con la Selección Nacional como en su momento se le hizo al guardameta de Santos Laguna, Oswaldo Sánchez, rechazó tal posibilidad, \\"no soy de despedidas, quiero retirarme como lo hice en el último partido contra Xolos, logrando algo en el autorendimiento, no en partidos con homenaje\\". \\"Tampoco me gustaría un juego con la Selección, no me gustan esas cosas, me gusta la competencia, soy competitivo y retirado no voy estar al nivel de la Selección\\". En sus palabras de despedida, Francisco Palencia hizo alusión a Cruz Azul y dijo \\"es como una ex novia que la ves y le dices que te vaya bien, estoy enamorado de Pumas y estoy agradecido con ellos (la directiva), porque es fácil enamorarse de este equipo y tengo mucho que agradecerles\\". En sus primeros años de profesional, Francisco Palencia (archivo), defendió los colores de Cruz Azul, equipo al que dice ver como una exnovia.

Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Mars is called 'the red planet'.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Mars is called 'the red planet' based on its distinct and vivid red color. This reddish hue, which is an unmistakable characteristic of Mars, plays a significant role in earning it this particular moniker. The red color of Mars primarily results from the abundant presence of iron oxide, commonly known as rust, on its surface. The planet's surface is mainly composed of basalt rock, which contains a large percentage of iron. Over billions of years, the iron within these rocks interacted with oxygen and underwent oxidation, creating iron oxide. The iron oxide particles then spread across the surface due to geological and atmospheric processes, giving Mars its widespread reddish appearance. Mars' atmosphere also plays a part in accentuating the planet's red color. While the atmosphere is thin and about 95% carbon dioxide, it contains a significant amount of iron-oxide dust particles. These particles scatter sunlight, further enhancing the red hue that we observe from Earth. The presence of these particles in Mars' atmosphere can also cause planet-wide dust storms, further distributing the iron-oxide and maintaining the planet's red coloration. In addition to its physical appearance, the red color of Mars holds symbolic significance. Throughout history, various ancient civilizations associated Mars with their gods of war, due to its conspicuous red color. For example, the ancient Romans named the planet after their god of war, Mars, believing that the red color represented blood and warfare. The ancient Greeks named the planet Ares, after their own god of war. In summary, Mars is called 'the red planet' due to its characteristic bright red color, which results from the abundance of iron oxide on its surface and in its atmosphere. This reddish hue bears both scientific and historical importance. It serves as an identifier for the planet's unique geological and atmospheric processes and connects Mars to various mythologies and cultural beliefs held by ancient civilizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: the limbic system is an important part of the brain because it regulates?","output":"The limbic system is a complex and critical part of the brain that plays a significant role in various functions related to emotion, behavior, motivation, memory, and cognition. Located deep within the brain, it is composed of a collection of structures that interact and cooperate to regulate a range of essential processes in the human body. Among the key components of the limbic system are the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and the fornix. Each of these structures plays a unique role in the overall functioning of the limbic system, and their collective contribution makes it a key player in several crucial aspects of human biology and behavior. The limbic system regulates the following primary functions: 1. Emotion: The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional processing and regulation. It interprets sensory information and assigns emotional valence to it, enabling the brain to differentiate between positive and negative stimuli. The amygdala is crucial for generating fear responses and has been linked to the development and mediation of anxiety disorders, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2. Memory: The hippocampus is the primary structure responsible for the formation and consolidation of new memories. It plays an essential role in converting short-term memory to long-term memory and helps form spatial memory, which allows an individual to navigate through their environment. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to memory impairments, such as anterograde amnesia, in which new memories cannot be formed. 3. Motivation and Reward: The limbic system is involved in the reward and pleasure circuits of the brain. The hypothalamus and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) release dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with motivation and pleasure. The release of dopamine in response to rewarding stimuli reinforces behaviors and promotes learning of those actions that lead to positive outcomes. 4. Hormone Regulation: The hypothalamus, a key structure within the limbic system, serves as a critical link between the nervous system and the endocrine system. It synthesizes and releases various hormones which regulate essential functions such as growth, metabolism, stress response, sleep-wake cycles, and reproductive processes. The hypothalamus also generates the releasing and inhibiting hormones that govern the pituitary gland's production and release of other hormones. 5. Arousal and Attention: The thalamus, another component of the limbic system, relays sensory information from the body to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus also contributes to an individual's level of arousal and attention via its interaction with the reticular activating system, which regulates wakefulness and consciousness. 6. Social behavior: The cingulate cortex is involved in various aspects of social cognition and behavior. This area has been implicated in processes such as empathy, moral decision-making, and the experience of social pain (e.g., feeling rejected or excluded). Dysfunction within the cingulate cortex has been associated with certain mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. 7. Homeostasis: The limbic system serves as a central regulatory structure for maintaining the body's internal state and responding to internal and external environmental changes. This includes integration of autonomic and endocrine responses, regulating body temperature, blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and energy balance. In conclusion, the limbic system regulates a myriad of essential functions related to emotion, behavior, motivation, memory, and homeostasis. With its integral role in human biology and behavior, understanding the limbic system and its components advances our understanding of mental health disorders and cognitive decline, providing potential targets for therapeutic interventions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.  Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts.  The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual Carols in the Domain in Sydney. Their final performance, after over 7000 shows over the years, was on 23 December at the Sydney Entertainment Centre.Also by 2012, The..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer would be: Page, Fatt, and Cook's last performance together was on December 23, 2012, at the Sydney Entertainment Centre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit  .  Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics  , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s.  Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection. Besides music, Patti Page did a bit of acting. She co-starred with the Oscar-winning Burt Lancaster in \\"Elmer Gantry\\", and also starred on stage in the musical play \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"What was Patti Page's occupation before beginning her singing career? A) Commercial artist B) Radio broadcaster C) Art department at a local radio station D) Stage actor Answer: C) Art department at a local radio station"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose your answer from: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no....I think the answer is","output":"3). no. The two presented scenarios in the question - \\"A group of people pulling on a rope\\" and \\"People are eating at a restaurant\\" - are unrelated and convey different situations. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that a group of people is pulling on a rope if people are eating at a restaurant. The first scenario talks a group of people who are engaged in an activity that requires physical effort, such as a tug of war or some team-building exercise. This situation usually occurs in recreational, competitive, or training environments. It can involve teams or individuals competing against each other or working together to achieve a common goal. The second scenario, on the other hand, describes a typical situation at a restaurant where individuals or groups are having a meal. In this context, people are focused on eating and socializing rather than participating in a physical activity like pulling on a rope. There is no direct connection between these two situations, and one cannot be inferred or deduced from the other. The statement 'People are eating at a restaurant' does not provide any information about whether or not a group of people is simultaneously pulling on a rope. In conclusion, given the distinct and unrelated nature of these two scenarios, the answer is 3). no – it is not possible to conclude that \\"A group of people pulling on a rope\\" if \\"People are eating at a restaurant.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

You are presented with the question \\"Sense of smell impacts an animal's what?\\" and the following answer choices:  - mate  - reproduction  - growth  - habitat  - survival  - Movement  - hormones  - traits  Now knowing that better senses have a positive impact on an animal 's survival and plus, our sense of smell is infinitely better, choose the best answer. A:","output":"The sense of smell has a significant impact on various aspects of an animal's life, including mate selection, reproduction, growth, habitat awareness, survival, movement, hormonal changes, and certain traits. However, if we consider the most overarching aspect that encompasses a majority of these elements, the best answer would be survival. The sense of smell is of paramount importance for an animal's survival, as it enables them to recognize and respond to key stimuli in their environment, such as detecting food sources and potential predators. It also plays an essential role in finding and selecting a suitable mate, which is directly linked to successful reproduction. Moreover, an excellent sense of smell helps animals perceive subtle changes in their habitat, giving them critical insights into resource availability, competition, and natural disasters. This ability ultimately allows them to make informed decisions about movement patterns and habitat changes. Hormonal changes and growth are also linked to an animal's sense of smell; many animal species rely on olfactory cues to initiate mating or territorial behavior, often driven by hormonal triggers. Additionally, the sense of smell provides young animals with the innate knowledge necessary for their growth and development, learning predatory, social, and foraging behaviors from their parents or group members. Certain traits linked to an animal's sense of smell can also increase their survival chances. For instance, animals with better olfactory skills may have a competitive edge over others, providing them with improved foraging abilities, predator avoidance, and mating success. In conclusion, while the sense of smell impacts several aspects of an animal's life, the most crucial and all-encompassing answer is survival. An enhanced sense of smell aids in detecting food, predators, mates, and other ecological signals, ultimately determining the overall success – in terms of fertility, adaptability, and population persistence – of a species. As such, the sense of smell is of utmost importance for the survival of animals, allowing them to thrive amidst a complex and constantly changing environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Farmyard: While this might seem like a possible answer, the term \\"farmyard\\" usually refers to the area around a farm's buildings, which might still be noisy or otherwise uncomfortable for the cows. 3. Countryside: This choice represents a broader, more natural area away from the city's noise and chaos, where cows can graze and roam in a quieter environment. This is the most logical answer to the question, as the cows are longing for a place that is opposite of the noisy city setting. 4. Fairgrounds: This option is not plausible, as fairgrounds typically host events that are noisy and crowded, similar to the city environment the cows are trying to escape. 5. Long horns: This term is unrelated to cows' preferences regarding their environment.

Answer the following question: Information:  - David \\"Dave\\" Gahan (born David Callcott; 9 May 1962) is an English singer-songwriter, best known as the baritone lead singer for the electronic music band Depeche Mode since their debut in 1980. He is also an accomplished solo artist, releasing albums in 2003 (\\"Paper Monsters\\") and 2007 (\\"Hourglass\\"). Though his bandmate Martin Gore continues to be the main Depeche Mode songwriter, Gahan has also contributed a number of songs to the band's most recent albums; \\"Playing the Angel\\" (2005), \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" (2009) and \\"Delta Machine\\" (2013). Three of these songs were released as singles, including \\"Suffer Well\\" in 2005, \\"Hole to Feed\\" in 2009, and \\"Should Be Higher\\" in 2013. In 2012 and 2015, he also contributed lyrics and sang lead vocals on the Soulsavers albums \\"The Light the Dead See\\" and \\"Angels & Ghosts\\". \\"Q\\" magazine ranked Gahan no. 73 on the list of the \\"100 Greatest Singers\\" and no. 27 on \\"The 100 Greatest Frontmen\\".  - \`\` World in My Eyes '' is Depeche Mode 's 26th UK single , released on 17 September 1990 , and the fourth and final single for the album Violator . \`\` Martin did the demo on his own , '' recalled Andy Fletcher . \`\` I do n't remember it standing out when we heard it then .

The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, main songwriter after 1981), Andy Fletcher (keyboards), and Vince Clarke (keyboards, main songwriter from 1980 to 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut album in 1981, \\"Speak & Spell\\", bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record \\"A Broken Frame\\", released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.  - Vince Clarke (born Vincent John Martin; 3 July 1960) is an English synthpop musician and songwriter.

Write an email with the subject line \\"Reduction of OOM?\\".","output":"Subject: Reduction of OOM? - Strategies and Solutions for Minimizing Out-of-Memory Issues Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the recent concerns about the out-of-memory (OOM) issues our team has been encountering. The purpose of this email is to highlight the possible causes of these problems and recommend a set of strategies to help us prevent these issues from recurring. Firstly, please allow me to clarify some misconceptions about OOM errors. The term \\"out-of-memory\\" is somewhat of a misnomer, as it implies that insufficient memory exists on the system. However, this is not always the case. The underlying issue is frequently attributed to the mismanagement of available memory by applications and processes. With that in mind, I have delineated below some of the common causes of OOM errors and suggested measures that our team can take to reduce and eventually eliminate them: 1. Memory leaks: When our software fails to release memory that is no longer in use, the memory is gradually consumed until the system reaches a critical point. To avoid memory leaks, it is essential to develop thorough testing procedures, perform regular updates and patches, and adopt continuous monitoring tools. 2. Inefficient algorithms: When processes demand a disproportionately large amount of memory, they can contribute to OOM errors. By profiling our applications to recognize memory bottlenecks and implementing more efficient algorithms, we can effectively reduce memory consumption and improve application performance. 3. Inadequate memory allotment: Allocating too little memory to applications can also lead to OOM issues. It is crucial to review our current allocation schemes and make necessary modifications so that applications have an appropriate amount of memory to run smoothly. 4. Garbage collection: Java-based applications utilize garbage collection (GC) as a mechanism to manage and free memory occupied by unused objects. If GC becomes overwhelmed and is unable to keep up with memory demands, OOM errors can occur. Investigate various garbage collection algorithms and runtime configurations to optimize GC performance and minimize the likelihood of OOM errors. 5. Hardware upgrades: Sometimes, there is simply not enough memory available for a system to operate efficiently. In this case, investing in memory upgrades for our systems could help improve performance and prevent OOM issues. Analyze our current hardware usage and determine whether an upgrade might be an appropriate solution. By implementing these strategies, I believe we can successfully reduce the occurrence of OOM errors, improve system performance, and maintain customer satisfaction. To move forward, I propose that we schedule a meeting with the team to discuss this issue and establish an action plan. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter and suggest a suitable date and time for the meeting. I look forward to addressing this challenge collaboratively and finding the right solutions for our team.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: When you get a regular checkup, the nurse will almost always take your blood pressure before the doctor comes in. Ask for the reading after the nurse takes your blood pressure and discuss the results with your doctor. This is the best way to get an accurate reading and sound medical advice at the same time. If you aren’t having any symptoms of low blood pressure, like dizziness or fatigue, it’s probably fine to just wait for your next physical to get your blood pressure taken. Many local drug stores and pharmacies have machines that you can use for free to check your blood pressure. Simply slide your arm into the opening and press the start button to wait for the machine to take your reading. This is a great way to get a basic idea of where you’re blood pressure is at. If nobody is waiting to use the machine, sit down for 5 minutes or so before taking your blood pressure to get a more accurate reading. These are available from nearly every pharmacy or supermarket, and can cost as little as 20. These devices are a great way to keep track of your blood pressure numbers from the comfort of your own home. Simply wrap the band around your bicep and turn the machine on to take your reading. Sit still and relax for 5 minutes before you take your blood pressure so that physical exertion doesn't affect your reading. Additionally, put your feet flat against your floor while you take the reading and don't cross your legs. When checking your blood pressure, the systolic reading, which is the top number, should be 90-120. The diastolic reading, which is the bottom number, should be around 60-80. If the systolic reading is lower than 90 or your diastolic reading is lower than 60, you have low blood pressure  Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure that is exerted on the arteries by the force of your blood being pushed through by your heart. Think of your body as a pipe. The systolic reading is how hard the water presses on the pipe when it’s flowing. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure that exists in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. If it helps, think of it as how hard the water pushes on the pipe when the tap on your sink is off. Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and you will experience fluctuations over the course of each day. However, blood pressure numbers should be kept as close to these averages as possible. Summary:","output":"Blood pressure reading is a common procedure when you receive a regular health checkup. The nurse typically takes your reading before your doctor's consultation, and discussing these results with your doctor can provide both an accurate reading and helpful medical advice. Unless you're experiencing symptoms of low blood pressure like dizziness or exhaustion, you typically only need to check your blood pressure during your routine physicals.  In between doctor visits, you can check your blood pressure at local pharmacies and drug stores, many of which provide machines for free public use. The process involves inserting your arm into the device and pressing the start button. For more precise results, allow yourself to rest for about 5 minutes before taking the reading, if there's no one else waiting to use the machine. Additionally, home blood pressure monitoring devices are readily available, costing as little as 20. These machines allow you to regularly track your blood pressure in the comfort of your home. To use them, wrap the band around your bicep and switch on the machine. Remember to sit quietly and relax for about 5 minutes before taking your reading, ensuring physical activity doesn't affect the result, and keep your feet flat on the floor without crossing your legs. In terms of reading, the systolic figure, the top number, should be within 90-120, while the diastolic figure, the bottom number, should be around 60-80. Systolic blood pressure reflects the pressure exerted on the arteries when your heart pushes blood through, resembling the water pressure when flowing through pipe. Diastolic blood pressure, on the other hand, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats, akin to the force against a pipe when no water is flowing. It's important to remember that your body is unique and blood pressure can fluctitate throughout the day. However, you should strive to maintain your numbers as close as possible to these general averages for optimal health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information:  - Fightstar are a British rock band from London, formed in 2003. The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are commonly known to implement additional metal and alternative rock elements into their sound, as well as several other genres. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much skepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, \\"They Liked You Better When You Were Dead\\" (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise.   - McFly is an English pop rock band formed in London in 2003. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, ukulele, guitar and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Son of Dork were a British pop punk band formed by James Bourne after his previous band, Busted, split in January 2005. The name of the band came from a scene in the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\" where the chant \\"Son of Dork\\" is used. Their debut single, \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\", was released in November 2005, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single, \\"Eddie's Song\\", reached No. 10 in January 2006.  - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - James Elliot Bourne (born 13 September 1983 in Rochford, Essex, England) is an English singer-songwriter and co-founder of pop rock bands Busted and Son of Dork as well as a solo electronic project, Future Boy. From 2013-2015 he was a member of supergroup McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - \`\` You Said No '' ( also known by its original title , \`\` Crash and Burn '' ) is a song by English pop punk band Busted . It was released on 21 April 2003 as the third single from their debut studio album Busted ( 2002 ) .

Question: Article: My name is Paul Miller. I was too fat before, but now I do not have this problem. My doctor tells me to jog . So early every morning I run for two miles before breakfast. I do not run fast, but I do not stop to rest. People call me a jogger. There are many joggers on my street. We often run together in the park or along the road. Jogging helps to keep us strong and healthy. Jogging is very popular in the United States. People like to feel well and look nice. Some people do not jog, but they do not get fat. They work hard on their jobs and they do not need to run before they go to work. Do you want to jog? Go to your doctor first. Your doctor can tell you something about jogging. My doctor tells me to eat only three meals a day. I feel healthy and my doctor is happy because I jog every day and I do not eat anything before or after meals. Question: Some people don't jog, but they don't get fat because   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they work hard\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"they work hard.\\" In the article, it is mentioned that some people do not jog, but they do not get fat because they work hard on their jobs. Engaging in various work activities that require physical effort or mental exertion can help an individual maintain a healthy weight without necessarily jogging or following a specific exercise routine. It is important to note that everyone's body and lifestyle are different, and what works for one person might not necessarily work for another. Maintaining a healthy weight and overall well-being typically involves a combination of regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and making informed choices about one's lifestyle. For some individuals, jogging in the morning is an effective way to stay fit and healthy, as it helps to increase their cardiovascular fitness, build endurance, and burn calories. For others, their daily life responsibilities and work commitments might provide them with sufficient physical activity to keep their weight in check. Nonetheless, consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a doctor, is always a wise decision before starting any new fitness regimen or making significant changes to one's lifestyle. Medical advice and guidance can help an individual make informed choices tailored to their specific needs, fitness levels, medical history, and goals. In the case of Paul Miller, his doctor advised him to jog, and this strategy worked for him, contributing to his improved health and weight management. In conclusion, the answer to the question is yes, \\"they work hard\\" is the reason given in the article as to why some people do not jog but still manage to avoid gaining weight. However, understanding that there are various factors and lifestyle choices that can influence the health and weight of an individual is essential.

I read this background article the other day: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.  I am facing a new situation today: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa.  He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","output":"Given the information from the background article, we can deduce the answer step by step. Step 1: The epidermis contains melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. Step 2: People with darker skin have melanocytes that produce more melanin. Step 3: Melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. Step 4: UV light exposure stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Step 5: People with darker skin have more melanin and thus have a reduced ability to absorb UV light. Step 6: Due to their reduced ability to absorb UV light, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Hence, using the above reasoning, we can conclude that members of Tribe A, who have dark skin, will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to members of Tribe B, who have light skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All members of the class are terrestrial, but they attained terrestriality independently of insects. Myriapoda is the only arthropod class not represented by a sequenced genome. We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede Strigamia maritima. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods, and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts, and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where S. maritima shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from S. maritima, and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families. For some genes S. maritima has evolved paralogues to generate coding sequence diversity, where insects use alternate splicing. This is most striking for the Dscam gene, which in Drosophila generates more than 100,000 alternate splice forms, but in S. maritima is encoded by over 100 paralogues. We see an intriguing linkage between the absence of any known photosensory proteins in a blind organism and the additional absence of canonical circadian clock genes. The phylogenetic position of myriapods allows us to identify where in arthropod phylogeny several particular molecular mechanisms and traits emerged. For example, we conclude that juvenile hormone signalling evolved with the emergence of the exoskeleton in the arthropods and that RR-1 containing cuticle proteins evolved in the lineage leading to Mandibulata. We also identify when various gene expansions and losses occurred. The genome of S. maritima offers us a unique glimpse into the ancestral arthropod genome, while also displaying many adaptations to its specific life history..

In defining   preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \\"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\\" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom. \\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\\"said Joshua Kendall,who is working on a biography   about Webster. \\"He at last bonded  us through our language.\\" Question: When did Noah Webster probably begin his project of the dictionary? Answer: Answer:","output":"Noah Webster probably began his project of the dictionary around 1800. This is based on the information that he completed the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 after spending 28 years on the project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Zynga Delights In Zany Awards Plan Mark Pincus (Image via CrunchBase) If you’re a star employee at a bank, utility or cement company, you can look forward to a whispered year-end bonus chat with your boss. At Zynga, it’s a different story. The creator of Farmville2 and other online games has turned employee recognition into a once-a-quarter public extravaganza that’s been known to include spandex costumes, stock awards as large as 100,000 — and a variety of public salutes. In a few weeks, right after first-quarter earnings are released, Zynga’s San Francisco headquarters will once again become the scene of an exuberant all-hands meeting. Company executives will honor top performers with the likes of “the Rockstar Award,” “the Green Beret Award” and a half-dozen other treats. Some winners earn a 5,000 trip to a vacation spot of their choosing; others get as much as 100,000 in vested stock. Zynga’s continued ebullience comes at a surprising time. The company’s once-breakneck growth in revenue slowed to just 12% last year. Zynga’s working alliance with Facebook has hit a bumpy stretch. Shares of Zynga trade at just 3.36 a share, down sharply from the December 2011 going-public price of 10, albeit up 40% from even lower levels at the start of 2013. Nonetheless, Zynga argues that a hell-raising tribute to employees’ best work is one of the smartest things the game maker can do. Zynga’s business is intensely hits-driven. So it’s worth encouraging the extra cleverness that can turn a moderately popular game into a global blockbuster. Zynga likes the fact that its awards are openly discussed among employees and shared virally, says the company’s chief people officer, Colleen McCreary. Such visibility “engenders pride,” she says. Besides, McCreary adds, “We spend a lot of time thinking about how we reward our players in our games, and we want to emulate that in our workplace.” Zynga’s celebrations aren’t open to the public, but McCreary pulled back the curtain a bit in a mid-March talk at the Wavelength leadership conference in Lambourn, England. “It’s like putting on the Oscars,” she said. Each quarterly meeting has a stated theme that calls for employees to costume themselves accordingly. One meeting was a high-school throwback with lettermen’s jackets abounding; another was a tribute to 1920s speakeasies, with some female employees in ball gowns. Zynga’s best-known awards, which have attracted media attention in the past, include the Zynga Spirit prize, which comes with 100,000 in vested stock. It’s given quarterly to three to five standout employees who embody all of Zynga’s core values. About 15 employees are singled out each quarter for the Atlas award, which comes with the 5,000 vacation. It’s given to employees who were “heavy lifters,” doing whatever was necessary to achieve great results. Meanwhile, 20 employees a quarter qualify for the Rockstar award, which consists of four tickets to a showcase concert or sporting event, along with two nights in an upscale hotel. Zynga has been busy coining other awards, too. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, it has been handing out the wryly named Innovator’s Award, which goes to teams or individuals that tried something daring. Some of these projects succeeded; others (such as an expansion of the Frontierville game) failed. Either way, Zynga says it wants to encourage employees to take smart risks. Last year, Zynga tried an even more idiosyncratic award: free use of company CEO Mark Pincus’s Tesla electric car for a limited period. Insiders decline to say whether that will be repeated anytime soon. Even with the profusion of awards, Zynga isn’t the gentlest place to work in the northern California tech boom. The company is famous for its long hours and demanding deadlines, as well as for CEO Pincus’s strong personality. Some 161 current and former Zynga employees have posted company reviews on Glassdoor.com, and only 54% of them say they would recommend the company to a friend. All the same, McCreary says she and Pincus think Zynga is on the right track with awards that involve highly public recognition, combined with personalized gifts that have meaningful economic value. Cash alone tends to have a more fleeting impact, McCreary says. If there’s no official discussion of who gets awards, employees don’t get as clear a signal about what conduct and performance wins rewards. By contrast, Zynga’s winners not only get trophies and applause from their peers — they also are lauded on an internal webpage called … what else? … AwardsVille. What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses Zynga, the creator of Farmville2 and other online games, and their unique approach to employee recognition. They host public quarterly celebrations with various awards like \\"the Rockstar Award,\\" \\"the Green Beret Award,\\" and others that include prizes such as 5,000 trips, vested stock up to 100,000, and other benefits. Zynga's creative awards are designed to encourage cleverness, risk-taking, and top performance among its employees. While the company is known for long hours and demanding deadlines, they believe their rewards create a sense of pride, visibility, and meaningful value for their workforce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do I know who I follow that do not follow me back on Instagram? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"These two questions are asking for different types of information pertaining to the Instagram application. 1. The first questions asks how to hide the list of users one is following on Instagram. This is related to the privacy settings and visibility of your Instagram account. 2. The second question asks for information on how to identify which Instagram users one is following who do not follow them back. This is related to the follower reciprocal relationship on Instagram. Here are the step-by-step solutions: For the first question about hiding Instagram following:  1. Unfortunately, Instagram does not currently have a feature that allows users to hide their following list. Unless your account is private, your followers, followings, and post lists are visible to everyone. But, you can choose the option to take your account private, which means only approved followers can see your content and follower/following lists. Here are the steps: 2. Open Instagram and go to your profile 3. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. 4. Select ‘Settings’ 5. Then, tap ‘Privacy’ 6. Under ‘Connections’, select ‘Account Privacy’. 7. Tap to toggle on ‘Private Account'.     Due to the Instagram policy, the follower/following list may still be visible to the user you follow, when you follow them or they follow you. For the second question about how to know who you are following that does not follow you back: 1. This process is not directly provided by Instagram. Instagram doesn't show unfollowers. However, there are third-party apps available to determine this. Some commonly used ones include Follower Insight, Unfollowers & Ghost Followers for Instagram, etc.     Before using such tools though, one should take into consideration issues related to app reliability, data privacy and security, and compliance with the social media platform's rules/agreements. Using such tools could potentially violate Instagram's terms of service, and may result in restricted functionalities or a ban.  Such platforms usually require access to your Instagram account data including username, password and other personal data which may be susceptible to breaches or misuse. Therefore, the best practice would be to manually check your followers list against your following list to determine people that you follow who do not follow you back. This, however, may be time consuming if you follow a large number of users. Please note that Instagram changes its features and policies frequently, this information is accurate as of the time it was written. It's best to check for the latest updates from Instagram's official resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(Associated Press)      After the suspect was taken into custody he died, despite efforts by medical personnel to revive him.      The struggle happened early Sunday at St. Cloud Hospital in the suspect's room, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He said the suspect was not handcuffed at the time. Investigators are still trying to determine what led up to the shooting.      \\"Several shots were fired during that struggle and then security officers were able to get into the room, and the suspect was tased with a Taser, and taken into custody,\\" Evans said at a news conference. \\"After he was taken into custody he became unresponsive. Medical personnel performed lifesaving operations on him and he died at that time.\\"      Evans said the Aitkin County deputy killed was Steven Martin Sandberg, a 60-year-old investigator with the sheriff's office. The suspect was identified as Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, who lived near the city of Aitkin. Evans said autopsies were being performed on both of them and the medical examiner would determine more about how the suspect died.      The superintendent said Hammond was subdued by two hospital security guards with the help of another Aitkin County deputy, who had just arrived to relieve Sandberg.      Sandberg had been with department since 1981 and an investigator for 20 years, Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said.      Evans and hospital vice president Kurt Otto declined to say why Hammond was being treated at the hospital in St. Cloud, which is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Otto said the hospital had asked the sheriff's office to send deputies to monitor Hammond because of the \\"seriousness\\" of the domestic incident, which happened sometime earlier in the week. They would not say how long Hammond had been in the hospital except that it was more than a day.      He said investigators had a lot of work ahead of them, including interviewing hospital staffers who were on duty at the time.      Hammond had been convicted of felony crimes including escaping from custody in 1990, third-degree burglary in 1989 and terrorist threats in 1990, according to court records. All the convictions were for crimes committed in Aitkin County.      Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton condemned the deputy's death and offered condolences to his family.      \\"I deplore the terrible, senseless murder of Deputy Sheriff Steven Sandberg,\\" Dayton said in a statement.      A woman answering the phone at Sandberg's home said nobody from the family was ready to comment. Hammond's home does not have a listed phone number. ||||| A violent “whirlwind of events” in a St. Cloud Hospital room early Sunday morning left two men dead, including a 24-year veteran of the Aitkin County sheriff’s office.      The man who shot him was tased by another sheriff’s deputy and died at the scene, authorities said.      “A suspect being treated at St. Cloud Hospital shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy who had been monitoring the welfare of the suspect who was a subject of an investigation outside the St. Cloud tri-county area,” said Jill Oliveira, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA).      The BCA said the incident was confined to the suspect’s hospital room, and no one else was injured.      The deputy was identified as Steven M. Sandberg, 60, who had been with the Sheriff’s Office since 1991 and working as an investigator for the past 20 years.      The suspect was Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said during a news conference in St. Cloud. Hammond, of rural Aitkin, was in the hospital for medical reasons following a domestic situation, Evans said.      The deputy was identified as Investigator Steven Martin Sandberg, who was 60 years old and is survived by a wife and daughter. He had worked with the Aitkin County Sheriff's Office since 1991. Photo provided by family members to KSTP.      Hammond was not in police custody, Evans said, but he was being monitored by law enforcement “at the request of St. Cloud Hospital.” He was not handcuffed, Evans added.      A struggle ensued after the suspect got out of his bed, Evans said, and Hammond got hold of Sandberg’s gun and squeezed off several rounds.      A deputy from the same Sheriff’s Office tased Hammond, and the suspect “became unresponsive,” Evans said.      Life-saving efforts were begun in the emergency room, but Hammond died, the superintendent said.      Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said the incident was a “whirlwind of events in [a] very tragic situation.”      Sandberg leaves behind a wife and daughter, Turner said.      A hearse carrying Sandberg’s body from St. Cloud to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office on Sunday afternoon was escorted by dozens of police vehicles in a motorcade along Interstate 94.      Hammond’s criminal history includes felony convictions for burglary and fleeing custody, both cases from roughly 25 years ago.      Law enforcement scanner conversation of the unfolding pre-dawn scene was captured by the MN Police Clips website.      “We do have an officer down in South 527,” came the word from the hospital to dispatch. “We have deputy that is shot … the shooter is in handcuffs.”      Dispatch described the shooter as “an inmate ... and the inmate is now in custody.”      An officer on the scene said the “guy got gun away from deputy, shot deputy” and the suspect went into cardiac arrest.      The weapon was recovered, the officer added.      In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Gov. Mark Dayton said, “I deplore this terrible, senseless murder. ... This tragedy reminds us that Minnesota’s law enforcement officers risk their lives every day and night to keep us safe.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A suspect in a domestic incident, who was being treated at a hospital in Minnesota, grabbed a gun from a sheriff's deputy, killed the officer, and prompted hospital security officers to subdue him with a stun gun.

As the world braces for a likely escalation of the conflict, grave questions are being asked about the potential repercussions. Analysts fear a backlash that could further destabilize the volatile region, even triggering a wider scale war involving regional powers. The stakes are high, and the potential for unintended consequences remains a significant concern. As America prepares to act, the imminent question is on the feasibility and potential fallout of intervention. Following past experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US is treading on thin ice, aware of the potential risks and complications. This decision could either weaken Assad’s regime, offering a window for opposition forces to regain ground, or it could further plunge Syria into a deeper abyss of civil unrest and violence. Furthermore, how this intervention is responded to by Assad's key allies, including Russia and Iran, could potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. This decision does not just impact Syria alone, but also has potential implications for international relations and global politics.  The UN, on the other hand, has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy over military intervention. In spite of this, it seems the US is poised to act unilaterally, emphasizing the urgency to respond to the alleged chemical weapons attack. At the same time, it becomes crucial to evaluate the legal framework that the US is basing its actions on. It remains a moot point whether intervention without explicit sanction from the UN Security Council could potentially constitute a violation of international law.  The prospect of intervention thus shines a spotlight not only on the Syrian conflict, but also has far-reaching implications which will impact the international political stage and potentially alter the rules of engagement in warfare. The debate rages on, insisting that concrete evidence is necessary to establish Assad’s hand in the alleged chemical weapons attack. While the world watches and waits, uncertainty and apprehension continue to dictate the narrative as geopolitical dynamics hang precariously in the balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the Brome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic, stating that it works great, and they are glad they bought two of them. They mention that the feeders are used daily, keeping the birds safe from squirrels, which leads to a high demand for refilling them.

However, without more context to fully understand the specifics behind the reviewer's sentiment, it is not possible to assign a concrete ★-rating to this review.  Nevertheless, considering that the reviewer has used the word \\"great\\" to express their satisfaction, it suggests that the review would likely fall closer to the higher end of the rating scale. Here are three possible scenarios, each taking into consideration the limited information provided in the review: 1. If we were to assume that the reviewer is attributing their excitement to a service or product that exceeded their expectations, it would likely rate as ★★★★★. This rating indicates an outstanding experience that surpasses standard expectations. 2. Alternatively, if the reviewer is genuinely satisfied but not utterly impressed with the experience, a ★★★★ rating might be more appropriate. This rating still signifies a high level of satisfaction, albeit with some minor aspects lacking or leaving room for improvement. 3. Lastly, if we were to infer that the reviewer has had varying experiences with the service or product but considers it to be overall satisfactory, a ★★★ rating might be fitting. This indicates a generally favorable experience, though inconsistencies or shortcomings still exist. In summary, while we cannot definitively assign a ★-rating to the review \\"Great!!!!!,\\" it can be surmised that the reviewer had a positive experience.

The brunt of that was aimed at Google, which makes the Android software that powers smartphones from a range of manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung Electronics and HTC. First, Jobs expressed skepticism about how Google reports its number of Android users. This is an issue Jobs has raised in prior speeches, yet he freely addressed the point of comparison, saying Apple has activated 75,000 more iOS devices over the last 30 days compared to Google's last reported Android activation number. Jobs, who made his comments in an unusual appearance on Apple's quarterly earnings call with investors, then took issue with the geeky argument of open versus closed, which refers to how transparent a system's source code is to developers. \\"I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform, after iOS and OPTIONS: - Adobe.\\" - Android.\\" - Apple.\\" - CNN.\\" - Google.\\" - HTC.\\" - Jobs.\\" - Motorola.\\" - Nokia.\\" - RIM.\\" - Samsung Electronics.\\" - Steve Jobs.\\" - iOS.\\"","output":"- RIM.\\" In this passage, Steve Jobs is talking about competition in the smartphone market.

Step-by-step breakdown and justification: 1. Kidneys filter waste out of blood. Justification: This step is essential for removing toxins and excess substances from the blood, ensuring that only necessary components are present in the bloodstream. 2. Composition of blood is regulated. Justification: Regulating the composition of blood helps maintain balance among its components, such as water, electrolytes, and proteins. This ensures the proper functioning of bodily processes. 3. Volume of water in blood is kept constant. Justification: Maintaining a constant blood volume, regulated by the kidneys, prevents dehydration and overhydration, which can negatively affect the body's functions. 4. PH is kept at a constant level. Justification: Keeping the pH level constant in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of cells, proteins, and enzymes. Kidneys regulate the blood pH by excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions. 5. Kidneys help regulate blood pressure. Justification: Kidneys play a vital role in regulating blood pressure by controlling fluid balance and secreting the enzyme renin. This regulation ensures that blood pressure stays within a healthy range. 6. Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells.

East-facing windows are particularly beneficial for a variety of house plants, as they provide an ideal balance of sunlight and shade. In this location, plants are able to receive direct sun exposure in the morning, followed by more indirect light as the day progresses. Direct sunlight is essential for the proper growth and development of many house plants. It aids in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, and helps to maintain their overall health and vitality. In limited quantities, direct sunlight can contribute to the vibrant, lush appearance that many house plant enthusiasts desire. However, too much direct sunlight can also be harmful to some plants, as it can lead to issues such as scorched leaves, wilting, and even stunted growth. East-facing windows provide a balance of direct sunlight and indirect light that allows most house plants to flourish without causing sun damage. The morning sunlight that east-facing windows offer is also generally gentler and less intense than the harsh, direct sunlight that plants may receive in south- or west-facing windows. This makes east-facing windows a suitable location even for more delicate or shade-loving plant varieties. Some of the house plants that will thrive in an east-facing window include: 1. Spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) 2. Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) 3. Calathea varieties 4. Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) 5. Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) 6. African violets (Saintpaulia) 7. Prayer plants (Maranta leuconeura) 8. Snake plants (Sansevieria) To further ensure the success of house plants in an east-facing window, it's essential to maintain proper care by monitoring the temperature, humidity, and watering schedule.

When evaluating a movie, critics and viewers may consider a variety of aspects. These include the film's plot, character development, acting, visual effects, music, pacing, and themes. If a reviewer states that nothing good can happen in a movie, they might be implying that one or more of these elements failed to meet their expectations or standards.

Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Supporters of President Obama’s health care law had predicted that expanding insurance coverage for the poor would reduce costly emergency room visits because people would go to primary care doctors instead. But a rigorous new experiment in Oregon has raised questions about that assumption, finding that newly insured people actually went to the emergency room a good deal more often.                              The study, published in the journal Science, compared thousands of low-income people in the Portland area who were randomly selected in a 2008 lottery to get Medicaid coverage with people who entered the lottery but remained uninsured. Those who gained coverage made 40 percent more visits to the emergency room than their uninsured counterparts during their first 18 months with insurance.      The pattern was so strong that it held true across most demographic groups, times of day and types of visits, including those for conditions that were treatable in primary care settings.      The findings cast doubt on the hope that expanded insurance coverage will help rein in emergency room costs just as more than two million people are gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And they go against one of the central arguments of the law’s supporters, that extending insurance to large numbers of Americans would reduce emergency room use, and eventually save money.      In remarks in New Mexico in 2009, Mr. Obama said: “I think that it’s very important that we provide coverage for all people because if everybody’s got coverage, then they’re not going to the emergency room for treatment.”      The study suggests that the surge in the numbers of insured people may put even greater pressure on emergency rooms, at least in the short term. Nearly 25 million uninsured Americans could gain coverage under the law, about half of them through Medicaid. The first policies took effect on Wednesday.      “I suspect that the finding will be surprising to many in the policy debate,” said Katherine Baicker, an economist at Harvard University’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of the study.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      An administration spokeswoman, Tara McGuinness, said that the time frame was too short to expect much of a change, and that over the longer term, use would most likely decline. She pointed to a longer-term study in Massachusetts, which expanded coverage for its residents in 2006, that found an 8 percent decline in emergency department use over a period of several years.      “Medicaid saves lives and improves health outcomes,” Ms. McGuinness said. “Plenty of studies show that.”      But many economists say that the emphasis on emergency room use, both in policy and in political speeches, is misplaced, as it makes up only a small part of health care costs in the United States. A federal government health survey found that emergency departments accounted for about 4 percent of total health spending in 2010, far less than inpatient hospital visits, which accounted for about 31 percent. Certain populations, however, like low-income people with chronic illnesses, have much higher rates of use.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Dr. Baicker and Amy Finkelstein, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another author, said the increased use of emergency rooms is driven by a basic economic principle: When services get less expensive, people use them more. Previous studies have found that uninsured people face substantial out-of-pocket costs that can put them in debt when they go to the emergency room. Medicaid reduces those costs.      Medicaid coverage also reduces the costs of going to a primary care doctor, and a previous analysis of data from the Oregon experiment found that such visits also increased substantially.      “This is just one piece of an increase we found across every type of care,” said Bill J. Wright, an author of the new study who is the associate director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Education in Portland, a part of Providence Health and Services, a large health care provider.      The study’s authors emphasized that Medicaid had many benefits. Previous analyses from the experiment found that gaining coverage reduced the incidence of depression and increased feelings of financial stability.      The study drew on data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment that included about 90,000 low-income Oregonians and randomly assigned about 30,000 of them access to Medicaid. Health experts say the experiment’s design — random assignment of coverage through a lottery — allowed them to isolate and evaluate the effects of the program. Such designs are the gold standard in medical research, but are rarely used for domestic health care policy.      Some experts noted that the study measured only the first 18 months after people gained coverage, and that old habits of relying on the emergency room are often hard to shake. It also takes time to find a primary care doctor and make an appointment.      “How to use a plan and when to seek emergency department care involves a learning curve that doesn’t happen overnight,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health researcher at George Washington University who was not involved in the study.      Amitabh Chandra, a professor and director of health policy research at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said people may often use the emergency room because they need its services. Medicine has become increasingly complex, with teams of specialists using highly sophisticated equipment for treatments that often go beyond the capabilities of the family doctor.      “We often say, ‘If this person had just received preventative care at a doctor’s office, we would not have seen emergency room use,' ” said Dr. Chandra, who was not involved in the study. “But there is only so much that prevention can do.”      Professor Rosenbaum pointed out that a lot of the recent growth in emergency department use has been among the privately insured people, not the uninsured. She said insurers often recommend going to the emergency room for quick specialty care, like for stomach pain.      Dr. Wright said that many participants in Oregon were already connected to a primary care doctor, and that it was unlikely that the rise in use had much to do with a lack of access to a physician. The study’s lesson, he said, was that new coverage needed to be accompanied by broader changes to the way care was delivered, like those in Oregon and under Mr. Obama’s new law.      Heidi Allen, an assistant professor at Columbia University and an author of the study, said much of the non-urgent emergency department use among patients she interviewed happened because those patients could not get same-day appointments with their primary care doctors.      Dr. Chandra, who helped conduct another analysis of emergency department use in Massachusetts after the overhaul, called the Oregon study, with its strong design and clear result, “breathtaking.” In contrast, studies from Massachusetts have come up with conflicting findings. His study, for example, found that emergency room use did not change.      “You would conclude what you wanted to conclude depending on which side of political aisle you were on,” he said, adding, “Now we have an answer.” |||||             As the health-care law expands Medicaid to cover millions more Americans, a new Harvard University study finds that enrollment in public program significantly increases enrollees' use of emergency departments.      The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, showed a 40 percent increase in emergency department visits among those low-income adults in Oregon who gained Medicaid coverage in 2008 through a state lottery. This runs counter to some health-care law supporters' hope that Medicaid coverage would decrease this type of costly medical care, by making it easier for low income adults to see primary care providers.      \\"I would view it as part of a broader set of evidence that covering people with health insurance doesn't save money,\\" says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has also studied Oregon's Medicaid expansion but is not affiliated with this study. \\"That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn't designed to save money. It's designed to improve health, and that's going to cost money.\\"      The Science study is part of a much larger research project that looks at Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion, where the state had limited funding to expand the public program to a set number of low-income residents. Oregon used a lottery to determine who would gain access to coverage, and that created a unique opportunity for researchers: The chance to study what happens when some people are randomly assigned to receive health insurance, and others are not.      Previous research on the Oregon Medicaid expansion has found that enrolling in the public program increased hospital visits, primary care trips and prescription drug use. That left an unanswered question: Were new Medicaid enrollees going their primary care doctor instead of the emergency department, or, were they using more of all types of health-care services?      This study suggests the latter answer: With financial barriers removed, Medicaid patients see their primary care doctor more -- and also go to the emergency department at an increased frequency. Medicaid enrollees made, on average, 1.43 trips to the emergency department during the 18-month study period, compared to an average of 1.02 visits among those who entered the Medicaid lottery but did not gain coverage.      Medicaid coverage also increased the probability of having any visit to the emergency department by 7 percent. The researchers also looked at the types of visits and found no decline in use of the emergency department for primary care treatable conditions among those who had enrolled in Medicaid coverage.      \\"Part of what makes emergency department use interesting is there are different theories about what to expect,\\" lead study author Sarah Taubman, also at the Harvard School of Public Health. \\"There's one theory that it increases, because insurance pays for emergency room care that would lead people to use more than if they faced the full cost. The other theory is that, by paying for primary care visits, insurance may lead to a decrease in emergency department use. We looked at this and, taken altogether, we see a net increase.      Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, extending coverage to all adults who earn less than 133 percent of the federal poverty line, about 15,000 for an individual and 31,400 for a family of four. Two more states, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are seeking to move forward with the health-care law program at a later date.      Although the Affordable Care Act initially mandated that all states expand their Medicaid programs, the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012 found that provision to be too restrictive, allowing each state to decide whether to participate.      Some governors have cited a reduction in emergency department visits as a reason to expand the public program.      \\"Today, uninsured citizens often turn to emergency rooms for non-urgent care because they don't have access to primary care doctors -- leading to crowded emergency rooms, longer wait times and higher costs,\\" one fact sheet from Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) states. \\"By expanding Medicaid, those without insurance will have access to primary care, lowering costs and improving overall health.\\"      And, when Congress was debating the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the high number of uninsured Americans being seen at the emergency department as a reason to pass the law      “Our health care system has forced too many uninsured Americans to depend on the emergency room for the care they need,” she said in a July 2009 statement. “We cannot wait for reform that gives all Americans the high-quality, affordable care they need and helps prevent illnesses from turning into emergencies.”      Gruber, the MIT economist, doesn't see the Harvard study as a compelling case against expanding Medicaid. There are still other benefits to insurance coverage, he says, that aren't about saving public funding. Separate research on the Oregon expansion, published last spring in the New England Journal of Medicine, found Medicaid enrollees to have significantly lower rates of depression and were more able to pay their medical bills.      \\"The overall notion is we're getting people more health care,\\" Gruber says. \\"There are huge improvements in mental health. For those who want to argue that expanding Medicaid is a free lunch, this is bad. But that was never the right argument.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A new study in the journal Science has found that expanding insurance coverage through Medicaid led to an increase in emergency room visits, contrary to the predictions of supporters of the Affordable Care Act, who expected that greater coverage would lead to a reduction in costly emergency room visits.

In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices.

The shooting has generated numerous protests and marches in the suburban town of Santa Rosa, with many residents questioning the deputy's decision to fire on the youth. Freitas also expressed sympathy to the Lopez family and thanked the Santa Rosa community for keeping protests peaceful. Police say Lopez was carrying a pellet gun that looked like an AK-47 assault rifle. A timeline released Thursday by the Santa Rosa police shows that only 10 seconds passed from the moment that the sheriff's deputy and his partner called dispatch to report a suspicious person to the moment they called back to say shots had been fired. FBI spokesman Paul Lee said he did not know why his agency decided to get involved or whether local authorities had requested its help. More than 100 angry middle and high school students walked to City Hall on Friday, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Hundreds of people protested earlier in the week. City police and the Sonoma County district attorney's office are also investigating. The Santa Rosa Police Department said two deputies in a squad car encountered the hoodie-wearing Lopez just after 3:14 pm. Witnesses say at least one of the deputies took cover behind an open front door of the cruiser, and one yelled twice \\"drop the gun.\\" Ten seconds after their initial report to dispatch, one of the officers called in \\"shot have been fired.\\" Sixteen seconds later, the deputies were calling for medical help. Lopez was later pronounced dead at the scene. The Sonoma County coroner said he found seven \\"apparent entry wounds,\\" two of them fatal. The deputies, who have not been identified, have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard after a shooting, officials said. Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas told the Press Democrat that the deputy who shot the teen is a 24-year veteran and his partner, who did not fire his weapon, is a new hire. Santa Rosa police Lt Paul Henry told the newspaper the deputy who opened fire later told investigators he believed his life as well his partner's was in jeopardy. The deputy said the teen didn't comply with commands to drop the gun and was turning toward the deputies while raising the barrel. \\"The deputy's mindset was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot,\\" Henry said at a Wednesday news conference. Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, said officers are typically justified in the use of deadly force when they sincerely believe lives are at stake. If the teen was raising the barrel of the gun toward officers, they had little choice about firing, Alpert said. \\"If it's a pink bubble gum gun and an obvious fake to most, then there is no reason to shoot,\\" he said. \\"But if the gun looks real the barrel is being pointed at you ... it's unfortunate, but a perceived threat trumps age and the officers have to protect themselves.\\" Hundreds of community members marched Wednesday night to remember the teen and protest the shooting. They covered more than three miles (five kilometers) from Santa Rosa City Hall to the field where Andy Lopez was killed. Some lit candles and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial with printed pictures of the victim, stuffed animals and a balloon that read \\"RIP Andy L\\"","output":"\\"Tragic Loss of Innocence: The Controversial Shooting of 13-Year-Old Andy Lopez by Sheriff's Deputies\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card Sentence 2: It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.   Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first, my first step is to understand the meaning of entailment in this context. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the entailed sentence) is guaranteed by the truth of another (the entailing sentence). The first sentence, \\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\", is a question. The question inquires about the possibility of doing \\"that\\" on a credit card. The second sentence, \\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\", is a declarative sentence asserting that it's not possible to do \\"that\\" on a credit card. Given these sentences, if the first sentence were true, i.e., someone genuinely asked whether \\"that\\" could be done on a credit card, it does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The second sentence could be true or false independently of the first sentence— it's possible that \\"that\\" can be done on a credit card, or perhaps it cannot be.  Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The truth of the second sentence (\\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\") is not guaranteed by the truth of the first sentence (\\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\"). They are not in an entailment relationship because the truth of one does not necessarily ensure the truth of the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lewis Hamilton is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the Formula One World Championship. So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg. The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend. The Brit says he was always positive and won't change his mindset now he leads the way. 'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility. 'In my mind I'm still hunting for it and I've got to go just as hard, if not harder, over these final races. I've just got to keep going.' After winning the last two races from pole position, Hamilton would appear to have momentum on his side. But given Mercedes' unreliability of late, he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn. 'Momentum is not something I generally talk about because it can be snatched away,' added Hamilton. Hamilton may have the momentum but Rosberg has shown how quickly it can all change over a season. 'Look at Nico. He had momentum from good results, and then one DNF (did not finish) and it was snatched away. 'I've also had that, so you just have to take it one race at a time. 'But I'm happy I've been at my best, getting the (recent) pole positions, maximising all the races. 'I now want to make sure these last five races - if I never do any more races in my life - are as good. They have to be the ones.'","output":"1.

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Do you know what the police do? That's right! They catch bad guys and keep us safe. Sometimes, to do their job well, they need to check who bad guys are talking to, or what they are saying. They do this by looking at something called \\"communications data.\\" This is the information about who someone is talking to, like a friend or a family member, on the phone or computer. A group called Big Brother Watch - they watch what's happening and tell us if we need to know about it - has shared some exciting news.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: This should be marked on the packet of envelopes, or on the envelope itself. Size 14 envelopes measure 5\\" x 11.5\\" and are considered the standard size. They will be rectangular in shape and will often be sold in packages at your local post office.  You can also mail a letter in an envelope that is smaller than a size 14, such as a size 10 envelope (4.125\\" x 9.5\\"), with a regular stamp. If possible, fold your letter so it fits in a standard rectangular envelope, as this may cut down on the price of postage. Envelopes larger than size 14 are considered large envelopes, or flats, and will be more expensive to mail. Card sized envelopes, made for small greeting cards or wedding invitations, will also likely have additional postage fees. This is because pieces of mail that have an odd shape or are square shaped and made of rigid card can jam mail processing machines and need to be processed separately. You can do this at the post office or on a small office scale. The weight and size of your letter (plus the envelope) will affect the price of postage, or how much you will pay for a stamp. Often, the heavier the letter is, the higher the price of postage will be.  Letters in a standard envelope that weigh less than 13 ounces can be sent via First Class Mail at one flat rate. Letters in a standard envelope that weigh more than 13 ounces will be upgraded to Priority Class Mail, and the price for postage will be more than the flat rate. There are three basic levels of mail, according to the US Post Office.  First Class Mail is often what is used to send letter-size pieces that are rigid and square. To send a letter First-Class, it must weigh no more than 13 ounces. The price for sending First Class Mail is the same, regardless of the distance the letter is traveling. The arrival time for First Class Mail is two to three days for destinations within the U.S. Sending mail First Class is ideal for a single letter as all you need is a standard stamp and access to a post box.  Priority Mail is ideal if you want your letter to get to the addressee by the following business day. To send a letter by Priority Mail, it must weigh no more than 70 pounds. At the post office, you can add on extra services to your Priority Mail item, such as USPS Tracking and Registered Mail, especially if your letter contains legal or sensitive information that must reach its destination. The price of Priority Mail postage is based on the distance the mail must travel; the further the distance, the more you will pay for postage. This is broken down by nine “zones”. For example, “Zone 1” is local, or the area close to you, and “Zone 9” is the furthest distance away from your location. Standard Mail is used for larger quantities of mail, at least 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail at one time. Envelopes must weight less than 16 ounces. Large envelopes, also called flats, cost more than letters. People use Standard Mail to send flyers, advertising documents, newsletters, catalogs, and bulletins. You can only send domestic mail by Standard Mail and you cannot send one single envelope through Standard Mail. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses different types of envelopes, their sizes, and the corresponding postage fees based on various factors such as weight, shape, and destination.

Assuming that:  In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. A:","output":"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relationship between the speed of a stream and the size of particles it can carry. Step 1: Understanding the concepts of erosion and sediment transport Erosion is the process by which soil, rock, or other materials are removed from a location due to forces like water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream, the water's flow can erode materials from the surrounding environment and carry them downstream. Step 2: Evaluating the effect of stream speed on particle size A fast-moving stream is more capable of carrying larger particles. This is because the increased energy and momentum allow it to move more massive objects along its course. As the stream slows down, its carrying capacity for larger particles decreases, and it becomes more difficult for it to transport these materials downstream. As a result, slower-moving streams are more likely to carry smaller particles, while faster-moving streams are more capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles. So, based on our analysis: A slow-moving stream is capable of carrying smaller particles than a fast-moving stream, as the carrying capacity for larger particles decreases with a decrease in stream speed."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Retail, transport and educational infrastructure are centred on Wrexham, Rhyl, Colwyn Bay, Llandudno and Bangor. It is bordered to the south by the counties of Ceredigion and Powys in Mid Wales, and to the east by the counties of Shropshire in the West Midlands and Cheshire in North West England.  - Gwynedd is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd. As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated. A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking. The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey. Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent.

The surviving portions of his two major worksthe \\"Annals\\" and the \\"Histories\\"examine the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in AD 14, to the years of the First JewishRoman War, in AD 70. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the \\"Annals\\" that is four books long.  - In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.  - Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex in Gwynedd , Wales . The fort was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78 , and was abandoned around AD 140 .

It is a scheduled monument in the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority .  - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.  - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use.  - Gwynedd Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire, Wales.  - Gnaeus Julius Agricola (13 June 40  23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \\"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain.  - The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain. Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.  - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union.    What is the relationship between 'tomen y mur' and 'archaeological site'? Answer:","output":"Tomen y Mur and archaeological site share a relationship in that Tomen y Mur is an archaeological site itself. By definition, an archaeological site is a location where evidence of past human activity is preserved and investigated using the discipline of archaeology. In this case, Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex located in Gwynedd, North Wales, and showcases preserved remnants of historical significance from different periods in history. Constructed under the Roman governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78, Tomen y Mur was abandoned around AD 140 but later reoccupied during the Norman period and refortified with a motte within the old Roman walls. As a scheduled monument under the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority, Tomen y Mur serves as an important archaeological site providing insight into the Roman and Norman occupations in the region. Archaeological sites such as Tomen y Mur contribute to our understanding of past societies, their cultures, and historical events. By studying the physical remains at these sites, archaeologists are able to piece together information about the people who lived there, their beliefs, social structures, and interactions with neighboring communities. In summary, the relationship between Tomen y Mur and archaeological site is characterized by Tomen y Mur being a prime example of such a site, where its historical remains serve as a testament to the Roman and Norman influence in North Wales and offer valuable insights into their respective societies and the transformation of the landscape over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city contributed less to marine pollution?  Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The answer to this question is:","output":"Pine city. Given the information provided, Pine city contributed less to marine pollution than Bird city. Pine city is located in the mountains and is inhabited by nature lovers and people who protect the environment. This implies that the residents of Pine city are more conscious about their impact on the environment and likely take measures to reduce pollution.  In contrast, Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea and relies mostly on conventional agriculture, using fertilizers for their crops. The use of these agricultural chemicals can contribute to marine pollution, as they can be carried by the river into the ocean. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from fertilizers leads to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones, which has a significant impact on marine life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.

Story highlights Archie Andrews will die in upcoming issue of \\"Life With Archie\\"      \\"Life With Archie\\" is a look at Archie's possible future scenarios      Series will end one issue after Archie's death      Since 1941, comic book fans have followed the exploits of teenaged Archie Andrews and his friends. This July, they'll find out how he dies.      \\"Life With Archie\\" #36 hits stores on July 16, and CNN can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how Archie sacrifices himself to save a friend.      Few details are known, but it seems fitting that Archie would go out a hero. The 37th issue one week later will end the series.      The \\"Life With Archie\\" series has been telling the stories of possible future Archie scenarios for the past few years, and so Archie will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day.      JUST WATCHED 'Archie' slated for a violent death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Archie' slated for a violent death 00:10      CNN spoke with Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater (son of Archie creator John Goldwater) about the upcoming issues.      CNN: Can you explain the \\"Life With Archie\\" series for the uninitiated?      Goldwater: \\"Life With Archie\\" is Archie's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college, which has never really been explored. Most fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop's Chocklit Shop with his friends. \\"Life With Archie\\" shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues.      Each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of Archie married to Veronica another with him ending up with Betty. The final issue, however, will show readers Archie's final fate in both timelines -- and they're the same.      CNN: Why kill Archie?      Goldwater: I think it's the natural conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" series.      Archie dies as he lived -- heroically. He dies saving the life of a friend, and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us. Our strengths and our faults.      Writer Paul Kupperberg, with input from myself, has crafted an emotional, impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time. This isn't a random one-off or \\"what-if\\" story that we're doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it.      CNN: What are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline?      Goldwater: First and foremost, like with anything we do at Archie, we want to tell a great, memorable story. That being said, this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the Archie brand.      We want to not only show how Archie's life ends, but also what he means to the world around him. We want to celebrate his life. After the events of \\"Life With Archie\\" #36, fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath, and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death.      What's Jughead doing? How are Betty and Veronica dealing with the loss? It's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great, evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like Archie can be, and how important it is to realize that.      This isn't a story we're going to retcon a few weeks from now. This happened. This is the conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" story and timeline, and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at Archie's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture.      We want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, joy and pride. We want people to react to this in a strong way because Archie is so important to them.      CNN: How do you hope fans will react ultimately?      Goldwater: We expect some level of shock, outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding. As a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we're building here at Archie.      I hope fans will be intrigued by this news, pick up the issues in July and realize they've been given one of the best comics on the stands. They'll be handed a piece of comic book history, featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon. We want fans to talk about this for years to come. We think this story is bigger than anything we've ever done -- it's bold, dramatic and best of all, a fitting end to the life of Archie.      CNN: What do you think Archie Comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years?      Archie: We're a sleeping giant. Years ago, before I stepped in as CEO, Archie was seen as a dormant, nostalgia brand stuck in amber. We were in suspended animation. People thought the stories were still set in the '50s!      Now, while the characters -- like Betty, Archie, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie -- are at their core the same, Riverdale has changed. It's caught up with the times. The town of Riverdale you read about now is like any other in America.      It's diverse, it's not problem-free, and it represents America in an honest way. Archie is about being welcoming, diverse and entertaining. We've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention, but keep people entertained.      From the introduction of Kevin Keller, the first regular gay character in comics to now, the death of Archie, we've not been afraid to take risks. The big thing is, though, our risks pay off because the stories, art and execution are spot-on. We back up what we say.      CNN: What will be the long-term impact of this story?      Goldwater: Well, this is the end. This is how Archie dies in the pages of \\"Life With Archie.\\" We will not be retconning, reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of \\"Life With Archie.\\"      The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. \\"Afterlife With Archie\\" [the \\"Archie\\" zombie series] will continue, and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters.      But as far as we see it, this is how Archie dies. That's how we approached this story and how we're treating it. ||||| It breaks my heart a little to learn that Archie Andrews, the freckle-faced teenager who has graced comic books since 1941, is going to die. At least temporarily. In an event comic book that seems inspired by his constantly resurrecting superhero peers, Archie Comics will kill off its hero to end the “Life With Archie” series, which flash-forwarded into different versions of Archie’s future as an adult.            (Credit: Courtesy of Archie Comics)      “Archie dies as he lived — heroically,” Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater told the New York Post. “He dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us — the best of us. Our strengths and our faults.”      But part of what has been best about Archie Comics is the way it has tended to avoid the sorts of escalating stakes that characterize superhero comics (even when the Punisher showed up in Riverdale, no one got whacked). As Archie Comics let its titular redhead grow up enough to explore what his life might be like had he married Betty Cooper or Veronica Lodge, Archie Andrews remained a kind of forerunner to “How I Met Your Mother” main character Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Precisely because the stakes in Archie’s life were so low, the comics could focus on his quest for true love without making the question of which girl Archie might pick seem silly.      The choice between what Michael Chabon described in “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay” as “the two big-toothed, wasp-waisted goddess-girls, light and dark, entangled forever in the enmity of their friendship” is easy to caricature as average and rich, nice and mean, tomboyish and feminine. But Betty and Veronica represent two competing visions of the American dream that Archie must choose between. Is he aiming for middle-class security with Betty, and a lifestyle they can support on relatively modest careers? Or does Archie truly want to leap classes and try to fit with Veronica and the Lodge family, who are convinced that their wealth is their due?      Archie Comics complicated this choice over time, introducing Cheryl Blossom, who was even richer than Veronica, as a potential love interest for Archie and breaking with its past discomfort about interracial dating and telling a story in which Archie marries fellow musician Valerie Brown and has a daughter with her. But whomever Archie paired up with and how we got there, the Archie comics have always been a story that treated decisions about courtship and dating as if they were serious and consequential.      Their counterparts in the world of superhero comics may have garnered critical respect and political attention on the big screen by tackling issues like use of drones and the privatization of military equipment. But as Matt Zoller Seitz pointed out in his review of “Man of Steel” last year, “virtually alone among big-name superheroes, [Superman is] a romantically and sexually mature man who seems to like and be comfortable around women.”      We all know that Archie Andrews’s preternaturally extended teenage years are a fantasy. But making the comics, however temporarily, about death rather than life, turns away from the franchise’s core purpose. Superhero and crime comics teach us about all the ways we can die. Archie Andrews, in all his bumbling, indecisive, lovelorn foolishness, has always been a character who taught us how we want to live. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In the upcoming issue of \\"Life With Archie,\\" the comic book character Archie Andrews will die as a hero, sacrificing himself to save a friend.

Article: How would you like to teach yourself, rather than have teachers? According to the UK's Department of Education and Skills, students will teach themselves in the schools of the future. This means that there will be no more problems such as finding enough teachers. Estelle Morris, the UK Education Secretary, opened the 2002 Education Technology Conference in London recently. To start the conference, she presented a video showing a computer--generated model of the school of tomorrow. Greater use of computer technology and classroom assistants will help students develop their own way of learning, Morris said. She added that this is a more exciting as well as a more interesting way of learning. At the same time, teachers will be \\"freed from their traditional role as the source of all knowledge\\". Children of all abilities will \\"form the curriculum around their individual needs.\\" They will \\"learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own environment\\". At home or at school, they will follow their learning programmes by looking at online libraries and watching lessons by world-class teachers and subject experts. Instead of going on field trips, students will use virtual reality. If they don't understand something, they can ask other students--\\"take part in virtual communities with learners with similar needs\\"--or e-mail their teachers. They will hand in their work electronically to be \\"auto-marked\\". The classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality. And the Department of Education will soon produce a guide to help schools adapt buildings for new technology, Morris said. These ideas are based on the UK government's plan to create an education system that provides students with a strong grounding of knowledge and skills at primary school level. And provides the chance for students to develop their individual skills at secondary school level.

Here is a news article: Mothers who sleep on their back or right-hand side on the night before giving birth are twice as likely to have a stillborn child compared with those who slept on their left, according to a study.      Researchers found that the risk of stillbirth for those sleeping on the left side was 1.96 per 1,000 births, and 3.93 per 1,000 births for any other position.      Tomasina Stacey, a midwifery lecturer at University of Auckland, who led the study, cautioned pregnant women not to be over-concerned by the finding. \\"It was an observational study, not one that can show cause and effect – all it does is show an association. It would be premature to jump up and down and say that everyone has got to sleep on their left. It's a starting point for future research.\\"      In the UK, there were more than 4,000 stillbirths in 2009; almost a third of these occurred late in the pregnancy term, after 37 weeks.      \\"Stillbirth is a much bigger problem than most people realise, and many are unexplained,\\" said Stacey. \\"In the UK and New Zealand, there has been very little change in the rate in the last 15 years.\\"      For the study, published in the British Medical Journal, she and her colleagues spoke to 155 women who had stillborn babies in Auckland between 2006 and 2009. They were asked about, among other things, their positions on going to sleep and waking up in the final weeks and month before the death of their baby.      For the control group, the researchers randomly selected two women who were at the same number of weeks in their pregnancy and questioned them about their sleep in the days and month before the interview.      The researchers wanted to examine the effects of sleep disorders in pregnant women, such as sleep apnea or snoring, which could be a factor in stillbirths, because these conditions can reduce the amount of oxygen getting to the baby.      Instead, the study showed that sleep position on the night before birth was the decisive factor. Stacey said a possible explanation could be that when a woman does not sleep on her left side, the foetus could compress her inferior vena cava taking blood back to the heart, and a reduced flow means less oxygen gets to the mother's – and in turn the baby's – other organs.      \\"If you've got a strong healthy baby, then the slightly reduced blood flow is fine; but if you've got a baby that is compromised in some other way, then maybe that reduction in blood flow can be the tipping point,\\" said Stacey.      The left lateral position is known in clinical settings to be the optimal position for looking after a woman in labour and is associated with foetal wellbeing in labour, she added.      An accompanying editorial in the journal by Lucy Chappell of King's College London says \\"any simple intervention that reduces the risk of stillbirth would be extremely welcome\\", but argues that the finding should be treated with caution. \\"A forceful campaign urging pregnant women to sleep on their left side is not yet warranted,\\" she said, adding that the study needed to be replicated to be conclusive. Alexander Heazell, of the University of Manchester School of Medicine, also pointed to a weakness – the fact that mothers were asked to recall their sleep position 25 days after a stillbirth.      Stacey said her advice to those women who found it uncomfortable to sleep on their left was \\"not to worry about it too much\\". But, she added, at a population level, the associations between position and stillbirth might be important.      \\"We could make a difference to the stillbirth rate by encouraging people to sleep on their left.\\" ||||| By Steven Reinberg      HealthDay Reporter      TUESDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- For pregnant women, reducing the risk for stillbirth may be as simple as sleeping on their left side, New Zealand researchers suggest.      In fact, women in the study who didn't sleep on their left side had twice the risk of having a stillborn infant, the researchers noted.      Overall, \\"the increase in risk [from right-sided sleeping] is small for the individual,\\" stressed lead author Tomasina Stacey, a graduate student in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland. However, \\"as many women do not sleep on their left side in late pregnancy, it may have an important impact on a population level,\\" she reasoned.      \\"This is a new and potentially exciting hypothesis, but further research is required before all women are advised to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy,\\" Stacey concluded.      Experts say improved blood flow to the fetus might play a role in any benefit of left-sided sleep, although that remains a theory.      The report is published in the June 14 online edition of the BMJ.      For the study, the researchers interviewed 155 women who delivered a stillborn baby at at least 28 weeks' gestation. They compared these women with 310 pregnant women with typical ongoing pregnancies.      The women were asked about their sleep position during the last month of their pregnancy, the last week of their pregnancy, and on the night they believed the stillbirth occurred.      In addition, the women were asked about snoring, daytime sleepiness, if they regularly slept during the day during the last month of pregnancy, how much sleep they got at night and how many times they got up to use the toilet at night.      The researchers found no connection between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth.      However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the night before a stillbirth were twice as likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who slept on their left side.      The absolute increase in risk of stillbirth to any one woman remained small, however: Stillbirths occurred in 1.96 per 1,000 cases among women who slept on their left side, versus 3.93 per 1,000 cases for those who slept in the other positions, the investigators found.      Women who got up to use the toilet once or less on the last night of their pregnancy were also more likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who got up more frequently, the researchers added. And there was a significant link between sleeping regularly during the day and late stillbirth risk, and also longer-than-average sleep at night, the authors said.      Still, Stacey was quick to point out that \\"an observational study such as this cannot determine cause-and-effect but it has identified an area that urgently requires further exploration.\\"      Lucy Chappell, a clinical senior lecturer in Maternal and Fetal Medicine in the division of women's health at King's College London and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \\"this is an interesting finding, but we should be cautious about making a large jump to saying that this is the cause of stillbirth. And we should not rush out to run a large campaign to say pregnant women should sleep on their left side.\\"      Chappell noted, however, that there are biological reasons that could support the finding. \\"We have long believed that blood flow to the baby, womb and placenta may be better when pregnant women are on their left,\\" she said.      Study coauthor Ed Mitchell, professor of child health in the department of pediatrics at the University of Auckland, believes the finding might help cut the number of stillbirths.      \\"If this finding is real and there is a causal relationship between maternal sleep and stillbirths, then the rate of stillbirths might be reduced by a third, which is tremendous given that the rate of stillbirth has hardly changed over the last 20 years,\\" he said.

Write a title for this article: “At present there is no cure for Parkinson’s Disease,” says the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. A French nun named Sister Marie Simon-Pierre knows what it’s like to read those words, as she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease when she was just 40. It was 2001, and Pope John Paul II was already visibly shaking from the disease, so Sister Marie knew where she was headed, and it wasn’t pretty. John Paul died in April of 2005, and Sister Marie began praying that he intercede for her. So did other nuns in her congregation, the Petites Soeurs des Maternites Catholiques. Then, she says, she woke up on June 3 cured, healed from one day to the next. The Vatican had its medical specialists look into the nun’s condition and determined that it was in fact a miracle. While there have been other miracles reportedly worked through the intercession of the late pope, this is the “official” one that allows Pope Benedict to beatify John Paul, or declare him blessed, on May 1. With another miracle, John Paul can be canonized, or made a saint. The miracles are frequently medical cures, inexplicable scientifically. They have to be sudden, complete, and lasting. While John may have done a great deed for Sister Marie – a miracle, really – she’s repaying the favor by coming forward and letting everyone know what happened. She doesn’t look someone who likes the limelight, and you probably won’t be seeing her on the late-night talk shows. But Sister Marie seems to be ready to go through what she has to in order say thanks to her miracle worker. John Paul needed a miracle to get through this point of his sainthood process; in a certain sense, she provided it.

After learning that Texian troops had attacked Castañeda at Gonzales, Cos made haste for Béxar. Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio.  The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio.  Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot.  After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad.  The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento.  After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca.  After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government.  Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor.  This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor.  Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

He worked in astronomical photometry and spectroscopy and is well known for creating instruments for the detection and measurement of cosmic phenomena . His instruments were used on the 200 inches ( 5.1 m ) Hale telescope at Mt . Palomar , California and the Keck telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii . \`\` He was one of the first really serious and really excellent astronomer - instrumentalists , '' says James E.

Its stated mission is \\"promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the world.\\"  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\".

Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - The Hale Telescope is a , 3.3 reflecting telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California, US, named after astronomer George Ellery Hale. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, he orchestrated the planning, design, and construction of the observatory, but did not live to see its commissioning. The \\"Hale\\" was groundbreaking for its time, with double the diameter of the next largest telescope and pioneering the use of many technologies such as vapor deposited aluminum and low thermal expansion glass. It is still in active use.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.  - A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a \\"catoptric\\" telescope.  - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The conference name is also commonly used to refer to those eight schools as a group beyond the sports context. The eight institutions are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. The term \\"Ivy League\\" has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism.  - Palomar Observatory is an astronomical observatory located in San Diego County, California, United States, southeast of Los Angeles, California, in the Palomar Mountain Range. It is owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) located in Pasadena, California. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Cornell University.  - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868  February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory.  - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.  - Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. Historically, spectroscopy originated through the study of visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, by a prism. Later the concept was expanded greatly to include any interaction with radiative energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency. Spectroscopic data is often represented by an emission spectrum, a plot of the response of interest as a function of wavelength or frequency.

Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam (), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. The first post-Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J. M. DeMatteis' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from Legends), he was given his own miniseries titled Shazam!: The New Beginning. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of Shazam! and the Justice Society of America characters. Before the Crisis, Thomas wrote several of the DC Comics Presents stories featuring the Marvel Family.  The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities.  This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly #623-626 (October 25, 1988 - November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Mazi was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam! ongoing series. Though New Beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \\"Spike\\") who was not Billy's sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the Shazam! project.  Other attempts at reviving Shazam! were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of Legends and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries The Man of Steel (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's War of the Gods miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else happen in the 1980s","output":"The article does not provide any other specific information about what happened in the 1980s related to Captain Marvel/Shazam or any other events.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy. This type of energy is called nuclear energy. This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission. Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun. Here the atoms nuclei are not split apart. Instead, the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together. This process is called nuclear fusion. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth. This energy from nuclear fusion warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Yes, it seems that you have a good understanding of nuclear energy, both in terms of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. To further clarify and expand upon this topic, let's delve into more details about these processes and their applications. 1. Nuclear Fission Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy nucleus, like that of uranium or plutonium, into two smaller nuclei, or fission fragments, along with the release of a large amount of energy. This process is initiated by bombarding the heavy nucleus with a neutron, which causes the nucleus to become unstable and split apart. The energy released during nuclear fission is due to the conversion of some of the mass of the nucleus into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². The energy released includes kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the emission of high-energy gamma photons and neutrons. Some of these neutrons can go on to cause further fission reactions, creating a sustained chain reaction. Nuclear fission is the principle behind the operation of nuclear power plants. The heat generated from the fission process is used to produce steam, which in turn drives turbines connected to electrical generators, thereby producing electricity. The use of nuclear fission to generate electricity offers several benefits, such as increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. However, the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, as well as the potential for accidents and misuse, remain significant challenges. 2. Nuclear Fusion Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two light nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes, to form a heavier nucleus, along with the release of a tremendous amount of energy. This process occurs naturally in the cores of stars, including our Sun. The high temperatures and pressures present in the core of a star force the nuclei to come close enough together for the strong nuclear force to overcome electrostatic repulsion, allowing them to merge. The energy released during nuclear fusion also results from the conversion of mass into energy, as described by E=mc². The net energy released in a fusion reaction is typically greater than that of a fission reaction, which is why fusion has the potential to be an even more efficient energy source than fission. Researchers around the world are working on developing nuclear fusion technology for use as a clean and virtually limitless energy source. Many experimental reactors, such as ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), are being built to study and develop the technology necessary to achieve controlled nuclear fusion on Earth, mimicking the process that occurs naturally in the Sun. The primary challenges in achieving controlled nuclear fusion include the high temperatures and pressures needed, as well as the development of materials that can withstand these extreme conditions. In conclusion, both nuclear fission and fusion are powerful processes capable of releasing vast amounts of energy. While fission is currently utilized in nuclear power plants to generate electricity, fusion holds the promise of an even more efficient and sustainable energy source in the future. However, the safe and responsible use of these technologies remains paramount to address concerns related to radioactive waste, accidents, security, and environmental impacts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What march was invoked when unemployment  became a political issue in the 1980s? , can you please find it?   Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march.

Build a movie plot around this: Did Rose commit suicide? no Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Last Petal of Rose\\" Step 1: A film plot structure begins with the setup or exposition.  Set up: This plot revolves around Rose, a bright, cheerful, and vivacious woman, who had so much to offer to the world. She was an eminent artist residing in New York, captivating people with her enchanting performances and also a beloved figure in her neighborhood, always ready to lend her help to anyone in need. Her sudden mysterious disappearance and assumed death leave the city shocked. Initial investigations indicate suicide, which seems highly unlikely. With no body found and no note, it all feels too suspicious. Step 2: Introduction of the protagonist and rise of the conflict Plot Development: Jacob, a seasoned investigative journalist who has been following Rose's career as an artist for an extended period, finds the conclusions of the police investigations difficult to swallow. Known for his ability to reveal the truth, he decides to dive deeper into Rose's life and her supposed suicide. The \\"conflict\\" here is to uncover the dubious circumstances around Rose's disappearance, setting the stage for the unfolding mystery and investigation. Step 3: Progression of the plot and introduction of key elements  Plot Progression: Jacob, through his investigation, uncovers many secrets. He begins to find out that Rose had many anonymous threats and creepy fan encounters. Jacob suspects that there's foul play involved and believes that Rose might have been targeted and possibly kidnapped. The plot thickens further as Jacob receives a mysterious note hinting towards a large-scale art theft racket which Rose might have accidentally unearthed.  Step 4: The climax of the plot  Climax: Jacob manages to track down the art theft racket, and in a powerful climax, he rescues Rose, who had been held captive by the art racketeers. The racket feared their cover being blown due to Rose's in-depth research for her new play on historical art pieces, leading to a series of events construed as Rose's suicide. Step 5: The resolution or denouement Resolution: The culprits are caught and their crimes exposed, providing justice to all the people duped by them. Rose, scarred but resilient, gradually returns to her life, vowing to use her art to raise awareness about such criminal activities. Jacob and Rose form a bond through the ordeal, promising to face any future adversity together. This plot carefully navigates the intrigue around the question, 'Did Rose commit suicide?' It creates a mystery thriller which intriguingly answers this query with a resounding 'No'. Through this story, we keep the audience on their toes, engaging them in an enthralling tale of art, mystery, and resilience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sony Introduces Digital Binoculars That Record Photos & HD Videos Sony entered the binocular market on Friday, introducing its DEV-3 and DEV-5 digital binoculars, both capable of capturing 7.1-megapixel still images and 1080 HD videos in either 2D or 3D. The binoculars are the “world’s first digital binoculars with HD video recording, zoom, autofocus and SteadyShot image stabilization,” according to the company’s announcement. SteadyShot image stabilization is the the optical stabilization system that’s found in Sony Handycam camcorders and Cyber-shot cameras — it helps keep images clear and stable, even when viewing at high magnifications. The binoculars come with a rechargeable battery pack that allows up to approximately three hours of 2D recording on a single charge. Also included with both models is a battery charger/adaptor, A/V connecting cable and USB cable for PC connection. There are only slight differences between the two binocular models. While both the DEV-3 and DEV-5 feature 10x optical zooms, the DEV-5 can digitally zoom up to 20x. The biggest difference is the DEV-5′s built-in GPS receiver, which enables it to automatically geo-tag videos and photos. Lastly, the DEV-5 comes with a number of fancy accessories not included with the DEV-3, including a carrying case, neck strap, finder cap, a lens cover and large eye cups. You really have to be an enthusiastic birdwatcher or sports fanatic to shell out for these puppies, though. The DEV-3 comes in at 1,400, and the DEV-5 will be priced at a whopping 2,000. We’re not convinced that a 600 price jump is justified for the addition of DEV-5′s GPS feature, advanced zooming and a few accessories.

While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann.  - Reinhard Keiser (9 January 167412 September 1739) was a popular German opera composer based in Hamburg. He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades.  - Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 in Kirchberg  10 May 1760 in Darmstadt) was a German harpsichordist and composer of high Baroque music who was a contemporary of Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel.  - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'composer' with 'george frideric handel'.

Three years later, the Holy Roman Empire found itself on the brink of war when Wolfgang Wilhelm claimed that the normative year imposed by the treaty took precedence over the Treaty of Xanten in regard to church properties. Since more parishes were in Catholic hands in 1624 than a decade before, Wolfgang Wilhelm hoped to stabilize his control over Jülich and Berg. The Aulic Council was still reviewing the evidence when Frederick William declared himself a protector of the Protestant population living in the two duchies. In June 1651, 3,800 Brandenburg troops invaded Berg, killing two civilians, bombarding Wolfgang Wilhelm's palace and seizing a herd of cows belonging to his wife. After rallying at Kaßlerfeld, the Brandenburgers created an encampment at Angermund and unsuccessfully beleaguered Düsseldorf. The Neuburg envoy in Vienna described the incident as a \\"Cow War\\", comparing Brandenburg's ruler to a cattle rustler. By July, Brandenburg had reinforced its expedition by 2,700 troops, mobilizing 16,000 more across its various territories. Wolfgang Wilhelm employed the help of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who launched a counter invasion of Mark with the intention of obtaining provisions for his army. The estates of all five duchies refused to provide money to either side, while Duisburg's city council requested Dutch protection. The Dutch condemned the actions of their former ally, while Sweden persuaded both sides to disengage through their envoy Melchior von Hatzfeldt. By the end of the year, Neuburg and Brandenburg had disbanded their troops. The Aulic Council distributed the church property on the basis of the current year, ending the conflict. Further negotiations in 1666 and 1672 confirmed the 1651 arrangements, putting an end to the dispute.

Article: Rick Westhead TSN Senior Correspondent Follow|Archive      (Updated: 6:07pm et) - National Hockey League linesman Don Henderson has filed a 10.25 million lawsuit against Calgary Flames defenceman Dennis Wideman more than a year after Wideman hit Henderson from behind during a game against the Nashville Predators.      CTV News and TSN have learned that Henderson filed his lawsuit against Wideman on Apr. 18 in a Calgary court.      Henderson seeks general damages of 200,000, special damages to pay for housekeeping, yard work and hospital expenses of 50,000, and damages for loss of income and future loss of income of 10 million.      The Flames are also listed as a defendant.      According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability.      None of the allegations have been proven in court. No statements of defence have been filed. A Flames spokesperson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.      Wideman hit Henderson during a Jan. 27, 2016, game in Calgary. Wideman was suspended by the league for 20 games as a result of the incident, the second-longest suspension in league history for abusing an official.      The NHL said in a video explaining the discipline that Wideman was diagnosed with a concussion after that game, but that his being disoriented was no excuse for “the nature and severity of the offence he committed on the ice.”      After an independent arbitrator reduced Wideman’s suspension to 10 games, the NHL went to court in New York in an attempt to vacate the arbitrator’s decision. The league lost that court battle on March 15.      In his lawsuit, Henderson’s lawyer wrote that he “has suffered a limitation of activities and loss of enjoyment of life, and will continue to suffer a limitation of activities and enjoyment of life.”      Henderson has incurred expenses related to medical care and treatment, prescription medication and other medical supplies, hospital expenses, and other damages, his lawyers claim.      “The Plaintiff has been and continues to be unable and restricted in the ability to work as he has yet to get cleared to officiate National Hockey League games, thereby resulting in a loss of income in an amount to be determined at the trial of this action,” the filing says.      According to his lawsuit, Henderson suffered injuries to his head, neck back, shoulder, and right knee. He also allegedly suffered a concussion, pain, numbness and tingling in his right arm and hand, shock anxiety and depression, headaches and permanent and partial disability.      The government of Alberta is also listed as a plaintiff in the case.      “The Plaintiff, the Queen, claims for the cost of health services provided to the Plaintiff, or which will likely be provided to the Plaintiff in the future for the injuries suffered as a result of the wrongful acts or omission of the Defendants as alleged…”      According to the statement of claim, the government has asked the court to order Wideman and the Flames to cover the cost of in-patient and out-patient services provided in a hospital, dental surgery services, optometric services, chiropractic services, services provided by a podiatrist, mental health services, drug services, or any goods or services provided by a health service. ||||| Don Henderson, the NHL linesman who was knocked to the ice by Calgary Flames’ defenceman Dennis Wideman during a game against Nashville last year, has filed a 10 million lawsuit against the player and the team.      Wideman cross-checked Henderson while returning to the bench after he was hit by the Predators’ Mikka Salomaki during a game on January 27, 2016.      The entire incident was caught on camera and about a week later Wideman appologized. \\"First thing I want to apologize to Donnie Henderson. I know I feel awful about what happened and hopefully he's recovering and he's gonna be back on the ice soon but I feel really bad about the whole situation. The last seven days have been tough,\\" he said.      Wideman was suspended from play by the league for 20 games even though he claimed that he was disoriented from the hit and that the contact with Henderson was unintentional.      The NHLPA appealed the decision on Wideman’s behalf and an independent arbitrator ruled to reduce the suspension down to 10 games.      Wideman had already missed 19 games while waiting for a decision on the appeal and returned to the ice before the end of the 2016 season.      This week, Henderson filed a 10.25 million statement of claim against Calgary Sports & Entertainment Corp, the Calgary Flames and Wideman.      In the claim, Henderson alleges Wideman 'violently' struck him from behind without warning, pushing him to the ice and referred to the hit as an 'attack.'      He claims he suffered injuries to his head, neck, shoulder, back, arm, hand and right knee and that he has required psychological counselling in addition to medical treatment.      Henderson says he has been unable to work since the incident and has not received clearance from the league to return to the ice.      According to the claim, the veteran linesman says he will continue to need 'costly therapy and rehabilitation' and that the incident has cost him millions in lost wages and future earning capacity.      None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have been filed.      The Calgary Flames declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did Henderson’s lawyer. CTV has reached out to Wideman, but has not heard back. |||||Summary:","output":"NHL linesman Don Henderson has filed a 10.25 million lawsuit against defenceman Dennis Wideman and the Calgary Flames over an incident where Wideman hit him from behind during a game against the Nashville Predators.

In this situation, the second effect mentioned, which is the construction of MORE and LARGER nests, would be directly influenced by the perturbation (inability to build nests).

She was raised in rural Kentucky and lived briefly in the Congo in her early childhood. Kingsolver earned degrees in biology at DePauw University and the University of Arizona and worked as a freelance writer before she began writing novels. Her widely known works include \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", the tale of a missionary family in the Congo, and \\"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\\", a non-fiction account of her family's attempts to eat locally.  - Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the creative ability to form images, ideas, and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses, such as seeing or hearing. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to \\"evoke worlds\\".  - A fair (archaic: faire or fayre) is a gathering of people for a variety of entertainment or commercial activities. It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society. This is measured by the explicit and tacit terms for the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity and social privileges. In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society. In the current global grassroots movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.  - In linguistics, sound symbolism, phonesthesia or phonosemantics is the idea that vocal sounds or phonemes carry meaning in and of themselves.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced.  - Phonaesthetics (from the \\"phn\\", \\"voice-sound\\"; and \\"aisthtik\\", \\"aesthetics\\") is the study of the inherent pleasantness (euphony) or unpleasantness (cacophony) of the sound of certain words, phrases, and sentences.  - The PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction, formerly known as the Bellwether Prize for Fiction is a biennial award given by the PEN American Center and Barbara Kingsolver to a U.S. citizen for a previously unpublished work of fiction that address issues of social justice. The prize was established by noted author Barbara Kingsolver, and is funded by her. Winning authors receive a 25,000 award and a publishing contract, from which they receive royalties.   - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.  - Marjorie Kowalski Cole ( July 20 , 1953 -- December 4 , 2009 ) was a writer of poetry , short stories and novels . She won the 2004 Bellwether Prize ( for previously unpublished works of fiction which address issues of social justice ) with her first novel Correcting the Landscape .  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.  - A novella is a work of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel. The English word \\"\\"novella\\" derives from the Italian \\"novella\\", feminine of \\"novello\\", which means \\"new\\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.  - Literary fiction comprises fictional works that hold literary merit; that is, they involve social commentary, or political criticism, or focus on the human condition. Literary fiction is deliberately written in dialogue with existing works, created with the above aims in mind and is focused more on themes than on plot, and it is common for literary fiction to be taught and discussed in schools and universities.  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - JUSTICE is a human rights and law reform organisation based in the United Kingdom. It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - PEN America Center (PEN), founded in 1922 and based in New York City, works to advance literature, to defend free expression, and to foster international literary fellowship. The Center has a membership of 3,300 writers, editors, and translators. PEN America Center is the largest of the 144 centers that belong to PEN International, the worldwide association of writers that defends those who are harassed, imprisoned and killed for their views. PEN America Center is one of two PEN centers located in the USA, the other is PEN Center USA in Los Angeles, it covers the USA west of the Mississippi.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology that developed as tools developed with human society. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is generally called \\"text\\", and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. Writing has been instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.  - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.    What is the relationship between 'marjorie kowalski cole' and 'novelist'? A:","output":"Marjorie Kowalski Cole was an American writer known for her works in poetry, short stories, and novels. She is primarily associated with the term \\"novelist\\" because her most notable work, \\"Correcting the Landscape,\\" is a novel. This work earned her the 2004 Bellwether Prize (now known as the PEN/Bellwether Prize for Socially Engaged Fiction) for previously unpublished works of fiction that address issues of social justice. As a novelist, Cole contributed to the literary world by creating stories that explore themes of social justice, human experiences, and emotional growth, making her an important figure in the realm of contemporary fiction."},{"instruction":"Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how old is kurt cobain's daughter Suggested answer: Cobain formed Nirvana with Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1985 and established it as part of the Seattle music scene, having its debut album Bleach released on the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989.

And are you ready for chocolate chip? Countless bagel bakeries on the Island have bagels in several flavors, but at Bagel Boss in Hicksville, the varieties definitely break new ground. Chocolate chip and spinach bagels, which they bake regularly, might appeal to the curious, ready to sample anything new. The spinach is salt-free, slightly vegetal-tasting and good with cheese. As for the chocolate chip, it ranks fairly low on my list of culinary delights, about on a par with chocolate cream cheese. Cinnamon raisin, on the other hand, while no longer a novelty, is given distinctive character at Bagel Boss with the cinnamon traced in deep swirls and plenty of big juicy raisins throughout. These can become addictive. The cinnamon raisin bagels - like the chocolate chip, spinach, rich egg, savory rye and excellent whole wheat bagels - are huge, almost twice the size of a common bagel. And unlike what Mel Rosner, the owner of Bagel Boss, estimates to be 95 percent of the bagels sold today, they are made by hand, not machine. ''Someone invented a bagel machine about 15 years ago, and that changed the whole business,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''Until then, bagels were always made by hand, but now the handmade is dying out.'' The large bagels made and sold at Bagel Boss are all hand-rolled by Sol Sapadin, a baker, who estimates that he makes 72,000 bagels a week by hand to accommodate retail sales and wholesale accounts. A new vegetable flavor, combining sweet potatoes, carrots, broccoli and spinach in the dough, will be introduced shortly. Smaller bagels, the plain classic plus six other flavors (onion, garlic, salt, sesame, poppyseed and pumpernickel), are stamped out by machine. Bagel Boss, which does a lively wholesale business, also makes minibagels and even miniature bialys, these particularly appealing for elegant brunches. Onion boards, regular bialys, bialy sticks, onion and garlic breads and caraway-flavored braided bagel rolls, ideal for sandwiches, are some other specialties. For parties, Bagel Boss will take orders for giant bagels, two feet in diameter, that can be split and layered with various fillings to feed about a dozen guests. These are priced at 5. Fillings for bagels - whether giant, mini, extra large or normal - include the whitefish salad, baked salmon salad or all-natural vegetable cream cheese spread also made by Bagel Boss. Bags of ''bagel thins,'' crisp, toasted thin bagel slices, are 79 cents each. If you buy two bags, the third one is free. Similarly, purchasing a dozen bagels, either of the hand-rolled varieties at 30 cents each or the regular ones at 20 cents, entitles you to an extra one. Minibagels and minibialys are 1.30 a dozen, and many of the other specialty items are 40 cents each. Mr. Rosner's partners in the business are two of his sons, Randy and Jerry. A third son, Adam, who is 17 years old, is apprenticing. ''We bought what was a very ordinary and not particularly well-run bagel bakery about five years ago,'' said Mr. R osner, who has been inthe business for 35 years. ''Almost from the beginning we started adding flavor s and sizes, but it's been gradual. The salads and cheese are th e newest line.'' Bagel Boss, which also sells hot coffee, daily newspapers, dairy products and some very dreary commercial pastries that really do not deserve to be displayed alongside the bagels, is open every day, 24 hours a day. The address is 432 South Oyster Bay Road, Hicksville. The telephone number is 681-1856 or 935-9879.

Are the following two questions the same? What is the difference between tablets and pills? What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill?","output":"While these two questions appear similar, they are actually inquiring about two distinct topics. The first question is focused on the differences between tablets and pills, which are two different forms of medicines. The second question, on the other hand, is concerned with the differences between a sedative and a sleeping pill, which are two types of medications with specific purposes. 1. What is the difference between tablets and pills? Tablets and pills are both oral dosage forms of medication, but they differ in their physical appearance, production processes, and composition. A. Tablets: Tablets are a solid dosage form that consists of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other excipients. They are usually compressed and have a uniform shape, typically round or oval. Tablets can be coated or uncoated. A coating can be used for various purposes, such as to improve taste, delay the release of the API, or improve stability. Key features of tablets: - Compressed and usually have a uniform shape and size - May have a score line to be broken into smaller doses if needed - Can be coated or uncoated - May offer a controlled or delayed release mechanism B. Pills: Pills, on the other hand, are older forms of medication that were traditionally made by mixing active pharmaceutical ingredients and other excipients with a binding agent and rolling the mixture into a round shape by hand or using a pill machine. Today, the term \\"pill\\" is often used colloquially to describe any small, round, oral medication like a tablet or capsule. Key features of pills: - Typically refers to small, round oral medications - Can include solid dosage forms such as tablets or capsules - Historically, hand-rolled and may have been less uniform in shape and size - Modern usage of the term \\"pill\\" is often interchangeable with \\"tablet\\" 2. What is the difference between a Sedative and a Sleeping pill? The second question refers to different types of medication with specific purposes: sedatives and sleeping pills. A. Sedatives: Sedatives, also known as anxiolytics or tranquilizers, are a class of medications used to treat anxiety, panic disorders, and some other psychiatric conditions. They function by depressing the central nervous system, thereby promoting relaxation, reducing anxiety, and inducing drowsiness. Examples of sedatives include benzodiazepines (such as diazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam), barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs (like buspirone). Sedatives are typically prescribed for short-term use or as-needed to provide quick relief from acute anxiety symptoms. Key characteristics of sedatives: - Clinical purpose is to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation - Can induce drowsiness as a side effect - Generally prescribed for short-term use or on an as-needed basis - Examples include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and some non-benzodiazepine drugs B. Sleeping Pills: Sleeping pills, also known as hypnotics, are a class of medications prescribed primarily for individuals with insomnia or other sleep disorders. These medications aim to help people fall asleep and stay asleep by targeting specific neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain. Some sleeping pills may also have sedative effects. Examples of hypnotics include benzodiazepines (e.g., temazepam), non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone), and melatonin receptor agonists (e.g., ramelteon). Key characteristics of sleeping pills: - Clinical purpose is to treat insomnia and sleep disorders - Help individuals fall asleep and stay asleep - May have sedative effects - Examples include benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin receptor agonists In summary, while both questions involve different forms or purposes of medications, they address different aspects of the pharmaceutical world. The first question discusses the distinctions between tablets and pills, which are both oral medication forms. The second question, however, compares sedatives and sleeping pills—two types of medications intended to serve different therapeutic purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Forum has initiated a process of informal collaboration with various organizations and legal experts, aiming to gather insight and input from different perspectives. This inclusive approach is essential to ensure that the resulting code is comprehensive and addresses the complex issues surrounding human trafficking effectively. The workshop, which will bring together experienced journalists, lawyers, NGOs, and victims of human trafficking, is a crucial step in the code's development. By involving those with direct experience in the legal and journalistic fields, as well as those directly affected by human trafficking, the workshop will foster meaningful discussions and debates that can inform the code's content. Moreover, involving NGOs in this process is vital as they often have firsthand knowledge of trends in human trafficking and possess a deep understanding of the mechanisms driving this phenomenon. NGOs work on the frontline, providing services, information, and support to victims, and this practical experience will be invaluable in crafting a code that is both effective and realistic. Victims of human trafficking are perhaps the most important stakeholders in the development of this code, as their experiences and perspectives can provide unique insights into the nature and impact of new legal frameworks and regulations. It is essential to include their voices in these discussions, ensuring that the resulting code fully addresses their needs and concerns and contributes to preventing future trafficking cases. In addition to developing the code itself, this workshop will present an opportunity for participants to exchange knowledge and best practices, identify strategies for countering human trafficking, and create a network of professionals committed to addressing this critical issue. By fostering such collaboration, the Forum aims to facilitate long-lasting change, as well as promote awareness of the scale and consequences of human trafficking. In summary, the Forum is organizing a workshop that involves a diverse group of stakeholders, including experienced journalists, lawyers, NGOs, and victims of human trafficking, to develop an effective code grounded in real-world experiences and expertise. By bringing together these parties in a collaborative setting, the Forum seeks to promote open dialogue and share knowledge, leading to the development of a robust and comprehensive code to address the issue of human trafficking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It compiles eleven tracks recorded by Davis's nonet for the label over the course of three sessions during 1949 and 1950. Featuring unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by classical music techniques such as polyphony, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title suggests, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. The nonet recorded twelve tracks for Capitol during three sessions over the course of nearly a year and a half. Davis, Konitz, Mulligan and Barber were the only musicians who played on all three sessions, though the instrumental lineup was constant (excepting the omission of piano on a few songs and the addition of Hagood on \\"Darn That Dream\\"). The first session occurred on January 21, 1949, recording four tracks: Mulligan's \\"Jeru\\" and \\"Godchild\\" as well as Lewis's \\"Move\\" and \\"Budo\\". Jazz critic Richard Cook hypothesizes that Capitol, wanting to get a good start, recorded these numbers first because they were the most catchy tunes in the nonet's small repertoire. That date Kai Winding replaced Zwerin on trombone, Al Haig replaced Lewis on piano, and Joe Shulman replaced McKibbon on bass.  The second recording date came three months later on April 22, 1949 with Davis filling in for Fats Navarro in Tadd Dameron's band with Charlie Parker during the interim. The band returned to the studio with five substitutions in personnel: J. J. Johnson on trombone, Sandy Siegelstein on French horn, Nelson Boyd on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums, and John Lewis returning to piano. At this session, the nonet recorded Mulligan's \\"Venus de Milo\\", Lewis's \\"Rouge\\", Carisi's \\"Israel\\", and \\"Boplicity\\", a collaboration between Davis and Evans, credited to the pseudonym \\"Cleo Henry\\".  The band did not return to the studio again until March 9, 1950. Davis did not call the band for any rehearsals or live performances between the second and third recording dates. The March 1950 date featured Mulligan's \\"Darn That Dream\\", \\"Rocker\\", and \\"Deception\\", and Evans's arrangement of Chummy MacGregor's \\"Moon Dreams\\", which had been released in a jazz arrangement by Glenn Miller and the AAF Band in 1944 on V-Disc. The band saw more substitutions, with Gunther Schuller on French horn and Al McKibbon on bass. Kenny Hagood returned for vocals on \\"Darn That Dream\\".

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction., Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction., A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline., For Love of Mother - Not ( 1983 ) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster . The book is chronologically the first in the Pip and Flinx series , though it was written fourth , as a prequel to help flesh out Flinx 's early history ., Alan Dean Foster (born November 18, 1946) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, a prolific creator of and contributor to book series as well as the author of more than 20 standalone novels. He is especially prolific in his novelizations of film scripts., Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\"., Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company)., The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from \\"Star Trek\\". The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a humanalien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species., Philip Lynx, known by the nickname of \\"Flinx,\\" is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the \\"Humanx Commonwealth\\", written by Alan Dean Foster and published by Del Rey Books., The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature., Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction., Subject: for love of mother-not, Relation: publisher, Options: (A) ballantine (B) creatures (C) del rey books (D) faster than light (E) naturalis (F) portal (G) star trek (H) success A:","output":"(C) del rey books"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does \\"The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally.\\" correctly answer the question of What do fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up?","output":"No, the statement given talks about the fundamental components of proteins, which are amino acids, rather than the composition of fatty acid monomers bound to glycerol backbones. Fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones make up a type of lipid known as triglycerides, or triacylglycerols. Triglycerides are an essential component of our diet and are the primary form of stored energy in living organisms. They are vastly different from proteins, as proteins are composed of amino acids, while triglycerides consist of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acids. Triglycerides' structure comprises a glycerol backbone, which is an alcohol with three carbons, each having a hydroxyl group (-OH). Each hydroxyl group of glycerol is esterified with a fatty acid. The fatty acids in triglycerides can be of varying lengths and levels of saturation, which affects the triglyceride's properties, such as its melting point and chemical stability. In a triglyceride molecule, the fatty acid component consists of a long hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (-COOH) at one end. Fatty acids can be saturated or unsaturated, determined by the presence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Saturated fatty acids have single carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, while unsaturated fatty acids contain one or more double carbon-carbon (C=C) bonds. When a triglyceride has one or more unsaturated fatty acids, it is called an unsaturated fat, while when it is comprised entirely of saturated fatty acids, it is classified as a saturated fat. Triglycerides serve multiple functions in living organisms, including energy storage, insulation, and protection. They are primarily stored in specialized cells called adipocytes, which compose adipose tissue. When an organism requires energy, triglycerides are broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids, which can be further metabolized to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fulfill energy needs. In summary, fatty acid monomers that are bound to glycerol backbones form a type of lipid called triglycerides (triacylglycerols). This structure is composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid chains, and it plays essential roles in energy storage, insulation, and protection in living organisms. Triglycerides are distinct from proteins, which are made up of nitrogen-containing amino acids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ATLANTA (AP) — Eleven former Atlanta public school educators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering for their role in a wide-ranging conspiracy to inflate scores on students' standardized tests.      Only one teacher was acquitted of all charges. The 11 convicted represented teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators who were accused of participating in the conspiracy dating to 2005, motivated by pressure to meet federal and local standards to receive bonuses or keep their jobs in the Atlanta Public Schools district of about 50,000 students.      A state investigation in 2011 found that educators gave answers to students or changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation.      A grand jury indicted 35 educators in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, false statements and theft. Many reached plea agreements, and some testified at the trial. Superintendent Beverly Hall never went to trial, successfully arguing she was too sick to mount a defense. She died last month of breast cancer.      Hall insisted she was innocent and had no part in any cheating. But the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding.      Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don't have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. However, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon.      \\"They are convicted felons as far as I'm concerned,\\" said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter.      \\"They have made their bed and they're going to have to lie in it.\\"      Bob Rubin, the defense attorney for former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said he was angry the judge decided to take the convicted former educators into custody immediately.      \\"I am shocked that he felt it necessary to do that,\\" Rubin said. \\"I felt it to be unnecessary and vindictive.\\"      Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching. Defense attorneys said their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime.      The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years.      The investigation involved at least 50 schools as well as hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled.      \\"Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,\\" Howard said.      The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable.      Hall served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief. She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district's poor and minority students. But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal.      In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal \\"alarming\\" behavior.      \\"It's become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,\\" Hall said. \\"There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct. I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option.\\" ||||| Guilty verdicts were reached for 11 of the 12 defendants in the Atlanta Public Schools CRCT cheating trial. Dessa Curb was the only defendant found not guilty on all charges.      Listed below are the 12 educators that went to trial and what charges they were found guilty, or not guilty of:      Racketeering - Guilty      Influencing witnesses - Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements (2 counts) - Not Guilty      False swearing - Not Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements & writings (3 counts) Not Guilty , Guilty, Guilty      False swearing - Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      Theft by taking - Not Guilty      False statements & writing (2 counts) Guilty, Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements and writings - Not Guilty      Theft by taking - Not Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements & writings (4 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty, Not Guilty , Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty      False swearing (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty      Racketeering - Not Guilty      False statements & writings (2 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements & writings - Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements and writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty      Racketeering - Guilty      False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty      All of these educators have been accused of racketeering, in addition to charges ranging from theft by taking to making false statements.      Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed issued the following statement after the verdict Wednesday afternoon:      “The APS cheating scandal marked one of the darkest periods in the life of our city. I am hopeful that with the jury's verdict today, we can finally close this chapter and move forward with the education and development of our young people. I want to thank Judge Baxter and the Court for their service.”      Unlike 21 others, the 12 educators on trial Wednesday did not take plea deals. Now their fates are sealed.      \\"They have made their bed, and they're going to have to lie in it,\\" Judge Jerry Baxter said as he sent most of the educators directly to jail. Ten of the 11 educators found guilty were booked into the Fulton County jail. The men were taken to the jail in northwest Atlanta, while the women were taken to the South Jail Annex for women in Union City.      Robinson was the only educator found guilty who was not immediately taken to jail due to her pregnancy.      According to a spokesperson with Fulton County police, the 10 educators who were taken to jail Wednesday were all processed as any other inmate would be, including being searched, fingerprinted, given a medical screening, having their booking photograph taken and given inmate uniforms.            A total of 35 educators were indicted in March of 2013. Prosecutors said they conspired to cheat or concealed cheating to boost test scores for financial gain.            The case, which grabbed national headlines, stemmed from a 2009 investigation that revealed system wide cheating on the Criterion Referenced Competency Test. The test, which was issued to students in the APS system, measured student aptitude statewide.      District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. called the verdicts a victory for children.      “When we indicted this case our goal was not to make a spectacle of the Atlanta Public School system. It was our attempt to encourage the people in our community to stop and take an honest look at what was happening in our schools and how changing test scores was ultimately harming our children,” says Howard. “We stand here today proud of our efforts, proud that we embarked upon a journey of truth, regardless of how long or arduous the task. We are certain today that our work has not been in vain.”      Fulton County prosecutors said the cheating began under the leadership of former superintendent Doctor Beverly Hall.Hall became superintendent in 1999 and submitted her resignation letter in 2010 after cheating allegations surfaced. She officially stepped down in June of 2011.      Hall had Stage 4 cancer and never made it to trial. She died on March 2.      Atlanta Board of Education Statement      This has been a sad and tragic chapter for Atlanta Public Schools that has now come to a close. It has been a painful time for our students, families, employees and the City.      However, since Day One 2015, APS has remained focused on the students under the new student-centered Superintendent, Dr. Meria J. Carstarphen, and the new leadership in the Atlanta Board of Education. Reforms began almost three years ago and additional ones have been created under this new leadership to make sure something like this never happens again. Challenges remain, for sure, but we are making progress every day and there is great reason to be optimistic.      Dr. Carstarphen and the school board continue to work together to create a new culture at APS, that is a caring one of trust and collaboration where every student graduates ready for college and career. Last fall, the district established a new vision of a high-performing school district where students love to learn, educators inspire, families engage and the community trusts the system. The district remains dedicated to always putting the needs of our students first.      Copyright 2015 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

I found the following answer on Google: The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","output":"No, the answer you found on Google is not related to the third theory of language acquisition. The third theory you might be looking for could be the \\"Interactionist Theory\\" of language acquisition. There are several prominent theories of language acquisition, and here's a summary of the three major ones: 1. Behaviorist Theory: Proposed by B.F. Skinner, this theory posits that language acquisition is a result of imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. According to this theory, children learn language as they are exposed to it, and they imitate the behaviors and expressions of others, reinforced by the responses they receive from their environment. 2. Nativist Theory: Put forward by Noam Chomsky, this theory argues that children are born with an innate capacity for language, called the Language Acquisition Device (LAD). This theory asserts that there is a universal grammar that all human languages share and that children have the innate ability to acquire language based on this universal grammar. 3. Interactionist Theory: This approach, commonly associated with Lev Vygotsky, suggests that language acquisition is a combination of both nature (innate abilities) and nurture (environmental influences). According to this theory, social interactions with adults and peers play a crucial role in language development. Children learn language through communication and by actively participating in interactions with their environment. These theories provide different perspectives on language acquisition, and no single theory can fully explain the complex process through which humans acquire language. Recent research in linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience indicates that a combination of genetic, developmental, social, and cognitive factors influence language learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Iraq produces its electricity by burning fossil fuels, while Iran uses nuclear fission as its energy source.  Which country causes more environmental problems?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.

The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879  November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II.  - USNS Short Splice ( T - AK - 249 ) was a United States Maritime Administration C1 - M - AV1 type coastal cargo ship , originally planned as an Alamosa - class cargo ship . Constructed as Short Splice for the Administration , completed in August 1945 and placed in operation by the War Shipping Administration during the closing period of World War II. However , the war ended , and she was transferred to the U.S. Army as USAT Short Splice who kept her in service until transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1950 .  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What was used to make conclusions about internet growth?\\"  Context: \\"An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet: \\"The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press\\": It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The conclusions about internet growth, as referenced in the context, were made by analyzing the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II. In this analysis, various factors and evidences were considered: 1. Freedom of Expression and Information: The first criteria for making conclusions was the impact of the internet on freedom of expression and information. The analysis pointed out that the digital revolution, which features the rapid growth of the internet, has been beneficial for freedom of expression and information. This indicates that internet growth has made it easier for people to express their opinions publicly and access information more readily. This could be due to the democratizing nature of the internet which allows users from all walks of life to freely express their opinions. 2. Impact on Traditional Media: The analysis also looked at the effects of internet growth on traditional forms of media like prints, radio and television. This underlined that traditional sources of funding have been disrupted by the internet. As the internet continues to grow and provide alternative means of content distribution, traditional media outlets, which relied heavily on advertising revenue, have been massively affected. This is because advertisers now have more platforms to choose from and online platforms typically offer more cost-effective and targeted advertising opportunities. 3. Emergence of Internet Journalism: The growth of the internet has given rise to new media outlets – indeed, internet journalism has replaced a fraction of what's been lost from traditional media. The comparison of the new and old medium was a significant factor while making conclusions. Despite the proliferation of internet journalism, according to the text, it has been able to replace only a tiny fraction of what's been lost due to the decline in traditional media. This implies that while internet growth has led to more sources of news, these new sources have not been able to fully fill the gap left by declining traditional media. In conclusion, the analysis derived conclusions about internet growth by extensively examining its effects on freedom of expression and information, its impact on traditional media, and the emergence and effectiveness of the new internet journalism. Each of these factors offered insights into how the growth of the internet has transformed mass communication. Furthermore, it emphasized the mixed results of this growth, portraying both the beneficial and detrimental outcomes, making a complex and multi-faceted conclusion on Internet growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Drawing upon her own life story, a story of discrimination shared by too many women across America, Lilly Ledbetter delivered a rousing speech as only she can. Ledbetter, the face of the fight for women's equality, reminded us all just how far we have come in the last four years. She framed fair pay as both an economic and moral issue. She reminded us all of President Barack Obama's first act in office, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which he signed thinking of his mother, wife and two young daughters. Ledbetter, a former manager at a tire plant, knows that her family was deprived of thousands of dollars because of discrimination, money that could have been put back into the U.S. economy. As my mother's son and the brother to two older and wiser sisters, this issue resonates particularly deeply with me. Equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the 21st Century, but like the debate over contraception and choice, somehow the Republican Party has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Dance of seduction is serious business in ‘Forever Tango’ The curtain call is usually the moment when performers can finally relax after a hard night’s work, loosening up and dropping the mask to reveal a bit of their true selves as they bask in the audience’s applause. But when the cast of “Forever Tango’’ took their bows on opening night at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, they remained as formal as they had been all evening, with few if any traces of smiles evident on their faces. That intensity was in keeping with the show they’d just performed, and with the tradition of the Argentine tango. Though it celebrates the power of fiery, heedless passion, “Forever Tango’’ is suffused throughout with an aura of focused professionalism and absolute concentration. That adds up to a display of proficiency without much personality in the show’s first half, when the performers make scant effort to draw in the audience. But after intermission “Forever Tango’’ turns into something special: its routines more challenging; the dancers’ movements still precisely controlled but also more fluid, dynamic, and communicative; their intertwined limbs virtually melding two bodies into one as they sweep across the stage. Conceived by Luis Bravo long before “Dancing With the Stars’’ was so much as a gleam in a network programmer’s eye, “Forever Tango’’ has proven durably popular, ending its most recent Broadway run in September. Bravo is at the helm for the touring production that will be in Boston through Saturday, and he’s also in the orchestra, playing the cello. Cutler Majestic Theatre, 617-824-8000. http://www.cutlermajestic.org Six male-female duos perform more than a dozen tango routines in “Forever Tango,’’ attired in a shimmering array of elegant dresses and suits created by costume designer Argemira Affonso. The dances are punctuated by evocative instrumental numbers performed by the fine orchestra, assembled onstage. Pianist Jorge Vernieri proved to be a particular crowd favorite on opening night. Less effective was vocalist Noemi Marcela, whose singing was often nearly drowned out by the orchestra. The dancers choreographed the tango routines themselves, and they perform them with disciplined technique and plenty of dazzling footwork. Their physical vocabulary relies on rapidly crossed ankles and scissoring legs and languidly stretched-out arms; on spins, twirls, and sudden kicks; on stomping and striding, slow-motion swoons and swift-paced back-and-forths. In one visually striking scene, when Aldana Silveyra and Diego Ortega were entwined, Silveyra allowed her long hair to cling to his head. While Bravo likes to describe the tango as “a story you tell in three minutes,’’ the truth is that “Forever Tango’’ would benefit from more variety in the stories it tells. There is a fundamental sameness to the emotional arc of a number of the tangos, which are enacted with fixed, urgent expressions that suggest everything is riding on this dance, or at least one particular thing, impossible to mistake. (After one smoldering duet, my companion remarked, “They need to get a room.’’) In Act 1, “El Suburbio’’ attempts a larger narrative than straightforward romance and seduction, presenting a scene in a brothel that features suggestively clad women and pinstriped, fedora-wearing tough guys. But a potentially intriguing power struggle dissolves into a farrago of clichés that ultimately generates less tension than the fight scenes Jerome Robbins choreographed for “West Side Story.’’ Act 2 gets off to a strong start with “Tanguera,’’ a duet performed by Soledad Buss and César Peral, and electricity steadily courses through “Forever Tango’’ from that point on. Ariel Manzanares and Natalia Turelli bring some welcome comic relief throughout the show. In one sequence, Manzanares keeps attempting to take pictures of the orchestra with a clunky, old-fashioned camera; later, he parodies the melodramatic seething of the tango dancers. Turelli clings to his back, allowing herself to be dragged as he walks across the stage, and when she tries to steal just a bit of the spotlight by making grand gestures, he quickly returns her hand to his shoulder. In “Quejas de Bandoneón,” Sebastián Ripoll and Mariana Bojanich succeed in creating a pair of distinct personalities while also generating an air of mystery tantalizing enough that you’re left wondering what kind of future awaits these lovers once the dance is over. At the end of “Forever Tango,’’ after the cast took their bows, they delivered one final display of their impressive dance skills. They still weren’t smiling, but by that time the audience was.","output":"\\"Forever Tango\\" is a theatrical dance performance that beautifully portrays the intensity and passion of the Argentine tango.

Only a few micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be androgen regulated. We aim to identify androgen regulated miRNAs.     METHODS We utilized LNCaP derived model, we have established, and which overexpresses the androgen receptor (AR), the VCaP cell line, and 13 intact-castrated prostate cancer (PC) xenograft pairs, as well as clinical specimens of untreated (PC) and CRPC. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed by microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). Transfection of pre-miR-141 and anti-miR-141 was also used.     RESULTS Seventeen miRNAs were > 1.5-fold up- or downregulated upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in the cell lines, and 42 after castration in the AR-positive xenografts. Only four miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-141, miR-150*, and miR-1225-5p) showed similar androgen regulation in both cell lines and xenografts. Of those, miR-141 was found to be expressed more in PC and CRPC compared to benign prostate hyperplasia. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-141 enhanced growth of parental LNCaP cells while inhibition of miR-141 by anti-miR-141 suppressed the growth of the LNCaP subline overexpressing AR.     CONCLUSIONS Only a few miRNAs were found to be androgen-regulated in both cell lines and xenografts models. Of those, the expression of miR-141 was upregulated in cancer. The ectopic overexpression of miR-141 increased growth of LNCaP cell suggesting it may contribute to the progression of PC.

A family told of their horror yesterday after a fox crept into their home through a catflap and attacked their young son. The two-year-old boy screamed in pain as the animal bit his heel, drawing blood. His startled parents ran upstairs after being alerted by the cries and found the fox sitting at the end of the child's bed. The animal then darted into another room and hid under a bed before running out of the house in New Addington, south London. The parents, who did not wish to be named, took the toddler to Croydon University Hospital, where he was put on a course of antibiotics. Yesterday the child's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, 46, said the boy has been left with two bite marks on his heel. She said: 'When I heard, my whole body went like jelly. I could not move. You think if they did not hear the fox, then it could have run off with him.' Mrs Vaizey, a care worker who has four children and nine grandchildren, said she had heard about fox attacks, but never dreamed it would happen to her family. 'When it is this close to home, it is so frightening,' she added; 'But he is fine. He is a tough little boy.' She added: 'He is the sort of boy that falls over all the time and has a laugh about it afterwards. 'But I just think it is so lucky they were still up at the time. ' She said the family had now put a panel over the catflap to prevent the fox coming back after the incident at 2am on October 30. She added: 'My daughter wanted to kill the fox. She said she never had a problem with them before, but now she hates them. 'She said this one looked really healthy and that he looked well-fed, so you do worry.' In June 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled by a fox that entered their home in Hackney, east London. Lola received facial and arm injuries, while her sister received arm injuries. The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, said she had heard about fox attacks but never dreamed it would happen to a member of her family. In February last year, a fox got into the bedroom of a one-month-old baby in Bromley and bit the child's finger off. Urban wildlife expert John Bryant said yesterday: 'Attacks like this are extremely rare and it involved the heel. 'There have been cases where people have been lying on sunbeds in their garden and have woken up to find a fox nibbling their toes. 'The fox is obviously investigating. It is very common for foxes to come in through catflaps. 'It is always wise to keep the cat in and shut the catflap at night. It is another incident, but fortunately minor.' The attack - which left the boy needing hospital treatment - happened in New Addington, south London last month. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A two-year-old boy in South London was attacked by an urban fox that had entered the family home through a catflap. The young child sustained bite injuries on his heel, resulting in a hospital visit and a course of antibiotics. The shaken parents found the fox sitting at the foot of the child's bed before it hid in another room and eventually fled the house. This shocking incident has left the child's family putting a panel over the catflap and harboring negative feelings towards foxes. The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, expressed her relief that her grandson is a tough child and that her daughter and son-in-law were awake when the attack happened. Fox attacks are relatively rare; however, they may increase in frequency as urban fox populations interact more with humans. It is vital for families with young children to take the necessary precautions, such as keeping catflaps closed at night, to avoid unwanted fox encounters. Urban wildlife expert John Bryant emphasizes the rarity of fox attacks and advises that people should maintain a sense of proportion and not let fear govern their behavior towards these wild animals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment Rio Ferdinand stepped onto the training pitch at Old Trafford, he was introduced to the standards and mentality that had become synonymous with Sir Alex Ferguson's era at Manchester United. The Red Devils were a team that demanded success, and this ethos was encapsulated by their midfield general, Roy Keane. The Irishman's drive and competitive nature were a vital component in the club's dominance both domestically and in Europe. Ferdinand, who was signed for a record-breaking fee at the time, quickly learned that there was no time for settling in or taking it easy. Despite his impressive performances for Leeds United and the England national team, Ferdinand was not granted any special treatment when he joined the Manchester giants. Roy Keane, as the team's captain, took it upon himself to ensure that the new signing understood the level of commitment required to succeed at the club. This instance highlighted Keane's role as an enforcer within the squad, making sure that every player gave their all in training and brought out the best of themselves. It was this relentless desire for victory that made Keane a vital cog in the Manchester United machine, driving his teammates to push their limits and fulfill their potential. Ferdinand, though initially startled by the intensity of his new teammate, would go on to embrace this winning mentality and form a formidable partnership with fellow defender Nemanja Vidic. Together, they would help form the backbone of a defense that would secure multiple Premier League titles, domestic cups, and the UEFA Champions League. In the end, it was not just Keane's talent on the pitch that made him an invaluable asset to Manchester United; it was his unwavering determination and ability to inspire those around him, even if it required a tough-love approach. Roy Keane's contribution to the club's list of honours is a testament to both his individual ability as a footballer and his effectiveness as a leader. Looking back on this first encounter with Keane, Rio Ferdinand can now appreciate the tough initiation he received, understanding the importance of the winning mentality that was instilled in him from day one at the club, a mentality that would carry him through years of successful partnerships, assertive team dynamics, and personal growth both on and off the football pitch."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The leader or chairman of a parliamentary group holds an influential political post in a parliamentary system with strong party discipline.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly Answer:","output":"The final step of the described process is the eruption of a volcano. To provide a detailed explanation, let's go through each stage of the process: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth: Various gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, are produced and trapped inside the Earth's mantle. As these gases accumulate, they create internal pressure. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface: The increased pressure forces molten magma (a mixture of molten rock, minerals, and gases) to rise closer to the Earth's surface. This often occurs through magma chambers and cracks in the earth's crust known as fissures. 3. The magma cools: Once the magma reaches the surface, it is exposed to lower temperatures and starts to cool. It can cool down either slowly or rapidly, depending on the environment and specific conditions. As the magma cools, it becomes solid, forming volcanic rocks (such as basalt or andesite) or ash deposits. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly: Over time, as gases continue to accumulate, and more magma is pushed toward the surface, the pressure within the magma chamber, fissures, or beneath the Earth's crust continues to build up. Final Step: Volcanic eruption: When the pressure becomes too great, a volcanic eruption occurs. The eruption can be explosive or effusive, depending on the amount of gas content and magma viscosity. Explosive eruptions involve powerful explosions that release ash, lava, and gases into the atmosphere. Effusive eruptions, on the other hand, involve the slow outpouring of lava on the Earth's surface without any significant explosion. After the eruption, the volcanic materials (lava, ash, rocks) continue to cool down and solidify, creating landforms like volcanic cones, lava domes, or extensive lava fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague. An effective, and classy, little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Set and filmed in and around New Orleans, Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine, Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story. It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. In turn, Richard Widmark {bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire}, Paul Douglas, Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel, all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic. Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece. From Widmark's Public Health doctor, with hypodermic needle in hand, running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior. It's an imaginative and intelligently written story, one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements, such as paranoia, blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway, this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir, and maybe not even essential Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10 Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie.

Q:Given the following context:  Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: \\"He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that I think he really didn't know...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the band that did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\"?

What is the answer they should choose between \\"black ice\\" and \\"tall grass\\"? Logic test: A grasshopper hops through tall grass and gets hung up, so he hops on black ice to glide faster. He does this because _____ is smoother for his jumps. (A) tall grass (B) black ice Answer:","output":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is: (B) black ice. To break it down, let's analyze the context of the question. The logic test presents a scenario in which a grasshopper hops through tall grass but encounters difficulties, which can be inferred by the phrase \\"gets hung up.\\" As a result, the grasshopper decides to change its course and hops onto black ice to improve its movement. The test then asks for the reasoning behind the grasshopper's preference for one surface over the other. The phrase \\"to glide faster\\" suggests that the grasshopper hops on black ice because it allows for easier and smoother movement compared to the tall grass. Therefore, the most logical explanation for the grasshopper's decision is that black ice offers a more conducive environment for the insect to achieve its desired level of mobility. In conclusion, based on the given information in the logic test and evaluating the context of the scenario, it is clear that black ice provides a smoother surface for the grasshopper's jumps as opposed to tall grass. Thus, the correct answer for your students to select is (B) black ice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They scrape a ceiling clean, then apply spackling. they Pick from: I. use a back scratcher to wipe it clean with a towel.; II. replace the tiles with a new one.; III. place wetness and plaster onto the ceiling over the plaster.; IV. cover the entire ceiling with the spackling.;","output":"After scraping the ceiling clean and applying the spackling, the men choose option IV, which is to cover the entire ceiling with spackling. They do this carefully and methodically, ensuring that the spackling is spread evenly across the surface. This is important because the goal of this process is to achieve a smooth and level ceiling, free of any cracks, dents, or other imperfections. The men start by using a broad putty knife to apply the spackling compound to the ceiling. They hold the putty knife at a slight angle and push the spackling across the ceiling, applying an even layer of the material. They add more spackling to the putty knife as needed, ensuring that they always have enough to properly cover the ceiling. As they work, the men pay close attention to any areas that may need extra attention, such as dents or holes from previously removed fixtures or other damage. They carefully cover these areas with additional spackling, feathering the edges to blend it seamlessly with the surrounding surface. Frequently, they assess their progress, taking a step back to view the whole ceiling and ensure that the surface remains even and smooth. In some areas, they may need to go over the spackling with a finer putty knife or a wet sponge to eliminate any trowel marks or ridges, blending the material flawlessly into the ceiling. They repeat this process over the entire ceiling, ensuring that every square inch of the surface receives the same meticulous treatment. Once the men have covered the entire ceiling with spackling, they take a moment to double-check their work, making sure there are no missed spots or irregularities. When they are satisfied with the coverage and smoothness of the applied spackling, they leave it to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The drying process often takes a few hours or even overnight, depending on the type of spackling used and the ambient conditions in the room. After the spackling has sufficiently dried and hardened, the men return to the room to inspect the surface. They may need to sand the dried spackling slightly, using fine-grit sandpaper to ensure a perfectly smooth finish that is ready for the final touch - painting or applying another surface treatment like wallpaper or textured finish. In conclusion, when faced with the task of scraping a ceiling clean and applying spackling, the best course of action for the men working inside the house is to cover the entire ceiling with the spackling. This involves applying the material evenly, addressing any imperfections, smoothing out trowel marks or ridges, and allowing ample time for drying. Once the spackling is dry, the men may need to sand the surface to ensure an impeccable finish that is ready for painting or other decorative treatments."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on margaret bechstein hays 's:    - death date       - birth date     - name     - death place     - birth place     Bio: margaret bechstein hays -lrb- december 6 , 1887 -- august 21 , 1956 -rrb- was a passenger on the rms \`\` titanic '' . she and her dog survived the ship 's sinking , escaping on lifeboat no. 7 . following the disaster , she cared for two small children known as the \`\` titanic orphans '' in her new york city home until their mother claimed them .

Q:One summer when I was 8 years old my father, mother, and I were rear ended by a 16 year old boy in a pickup truck. Insurance companies dawdled and by the time we received a settlement over a year later my parents had divorced. I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat. My mother was nowhere to be found until a few years later. We received the settlement and it turned out to be several thousand dollars. My dad turned on the electricity and bought our first computer, a Packard Bell. Now we needed dial up internet! -My what a change! Then he started dating online. He met a woman who lived in Franklin, TN (Williamson County), dated and married her (at least for a few years), worked at CompUSA for a few years, then started his own computer repair business which he and I ran from 2001 to 2014 before selling it. Williamson County population : 226,257 Wayne County population : 16,583 I ran a business with my father, graduated from a high school that was ranked 24/273 instead of one ranked of 223/273 in the state.

Movie plot title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.

Eric covered his nose with a tissue in a feeble attempt to filter the air around him. He had been friends with Brett for years and yet, he still found it difficult to adapt to Brett's obsession for fresh flowers; an obsession that made every visit to Brett's house an absolute nightmare for Eric, who was unfortunately allergic to pollen. It all started when the two of them were roommates in college. Brett would always sneak fresh flowers into their room, carefully placing them around the space to brighten up the atmosphere. Eric, on the other hand, would constantly sneeze and wake up with puffy eyes. Eventually, they found a compromise. Brett agreed to limit the number of fresh flowers in their shared space, while Eric tried to build up a tolerance by taking allergy medication. As the years passed, they both moved on to their respective lives, but remained close friends. In spite of the challenges that the flowers posed to Eric, he appreciated the beauty they brought to Brett's home.

Regardless, he put on a brave face and managed a half-hearted smile, saying, \\"That's amazing, Brett! Congratulations!\\" As the year went on, Brett's house continued to fill with various floral arrangements, and Eric made sure to fortify himself with allergy medication before every visit.

Meanwhile, a subsidence problem that had irreparably damaged at least 10 downtown buildings by 1928 worsened through the 1930s. Dozens of buildings, including the post office and jail, were lost as the earth beneath them sank away. Contributing causes were geologic faulting in the area, blast vibrations from the mines, and erosion that may have been exacerbated by vegetation-killing smelter smoke.Mining continued at a reduced level in the Verde District until 1953, when Phelps Dodge shut down the United Verde Mine and related operations. Jerome's population subsequently fell below 100. To prevent the town from disappearing completely, its remaining residents turned to tourism and retail sales. They organized the Jerome Historical Society in 1953 and opened a museum and gift shop.To encourage tourism, the town's leaders sought National Historic Landmark status for Jerome; it was granted by the federal government in 1967. In 1962, the heirs of James Douglas donated the Douglas mansion, above the UVX mine site, to the State of Arizona, which used it to create Jerome State Historic Park. By sponsoring music festivals, historic-homes tours, celebrations, and races, the community succeeded in attracting visitors and new businesses, which in the 21st century include art galleries, craft stores, wineries, coffee houses, and restaurants.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the reason Brown was suspected of committing the murders?, using the article: The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi...., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","output":"The reason James Brown and his overseer, Eastwood, were suspected of committing the Avenue Range Station massacre was due to their suspected motive of retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep by the Aboriginal Australians. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines, who then conducted an investigation in the district. Based on the evidence and testimonies gathered during his enquiries, Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Although proceedings started in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, they were eventually abandoned. This was primarily due to key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fleeing the colony or refusing to cooperate with the investigation. Moreover, there were significant legal restrictions on the use of evidence provided by Aboriginal witnesses, particularly in cases where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal obstacles, combined with settler solidarity, ensured that the case did not go to trial. However, the magistrate who committed Brown for trial informed a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher.\\" It is important to note that later accounts of the massacre claimed that Brown poisoned the victims instead of shooting them and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide in an attempt to establish an alibi.

However, since the available choices provided are only (a) negative or (b) positive, it's essential to analyze the content of the review further and determine which sentiment is more prominent. The positive aspects mentioned in the review include: 1. Fast taxi service - This indicates satisfaction with the transportation services provided. 2. A people-watching mecca - This implies that the environment is lively, social, and engaging, which some people consider to be a desirable aspect. 3. Decent amount of food and drink choices - A good variety in dining options generally contributes to a positive experience. 4. Slot machines - The presence of entertainment options such as slot machines can enhance an individual's overall enjoyment. The negative aspects mentioned in the review include: 1. Flight delays - This indicates dissatisfaction with the timeliness and efficiency of the services provided. 2. Slow baggage claim - This implies frustration with the waiting times and inefficiency associated with baggage claim operations. 3. Super packed - This entails a crowded environment, which can be uncomfortable and detract from the overall experience. Comparing the positive and negative aspects in the review, it seems that the significance of the negative experiences (flight delays, slow baggage claim, and crowdedness) might outweigh the positive aspects (fast taxi services, people-watching, food/drink choices, and slot machines). This is mainly because the core services of an airport (flight punctuality and the processing of baggage) seem to be inefficient, which could lead to significant inconvenience and dissatisfaction. Taking these factors into consideration, it may be more accurate to classify the sentiment of this review as (a) negative. Although there are definite positive aspects mentioned, the negative components appear to have a more significant impact on the overall experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received a higher wages.

Employers got workers who had better skills, which made their businesses work better and cost less.

Question: Given the below context:  Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world. By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for world's largest city. Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as Baghdad, Chang'an, Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world's most populous city until the 12th century. It never returned to being the world's largest, but remained Europe's largest city from 1500 to 1750, when it was surpassed by London.The Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was 14,377,019 at the end of 2014, hosting 19 percent of the country's population. Then about 97–98% of the inhabitants of the metropolitan municipality were within city limits, up from 89% in 2007 and 61% in 1980. 64.9% of the residents live on the European side and 35.1% on the Asian side. While the city ranks as the world's 5th-largest city proper, it drops to the 24th place as an urban area and to the 18th place as a metro area because the city limits are roughly equivalent to the agglomeration. Today, it forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, alongside Moscow. The city's annual population growth of 3.45 percent ranks as the highest among the seventy-eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country, as the second and third fastest-growing OECD metropolises are the Turkish cities of İzmir and Ankara. Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000. This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city limits—particularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions. The...  Guess a valid title for it!

The metamorphosis of a Communist Party expatriate to business consultant mirrors China's shift from a closed-door state to a freewheeling money-making society. OPT: [i] World; [ii] Sports; [iii] Business; [iv] Science/Tech;","output":"This topic is primarily about [iii] Business. The metamorphosis of a Communist Party expatriate to a business consultant showcases China's significant economic transformation over the past few decades. This change has been driven by numerous factors, including China's shift from a centrally planned, closed-door state to a more market-oriented economy with a strong focus on global trade and economic growth. The transition has been both rapid and dramatic, impacting not only those directly involved in the business world but society as a whole. The opening up of China's economic system began earnestly in the late 1970s under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. His policies emphasized the need to modernize industry, agriculture, technology, and defense while also focusing on expanding foreign trade and investment. One of his most important initiatives was the introduction of the \\"reform and opening-up\\" policy, which encouraged the growth of private enterprise and allowed for the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). These SEZs, such as Shenzhen and Shanghai's Pudong area, provided tax incentives and lighter regulations for foreign companies investing in the region. The resulting influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) drove economic development, spurring growth in Chinese manufacturing capabilities, technological prowess, and infrastructure. Moreover, China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 was another essential milestone in its opening up to the international business community. This event marked China's commitment to adopting international trade rules and regulations, furthering the integration of its economy with the global market. As a result of these reforms, China quickly experienced dramatic growth in its GDP and became the world's second-largest economy after the United States. Its burgeoning middle class and newfound economic prowess opened the Chinese market to a wide array of consumer products and services from all over the world. This has had a profound impact on Chinese society as a whole. The story of a Communist Party expatriate becoming a business consultant is reflective of these profound changes. Once committed to the principles of communism and the strict limitations of a closed economy, this individual's transformation to a business consultant indicates the adaptation necessary to thrive in China's new economic environment. This adaptation showcases the willingness to embrace market-oriented principles and a commitment to economic growth as a means of promoting the well-being of Chinese society. In conclusion, this story is about business, specifically the extraordinary metamorphosis of China's economic policies and the individuals whose lives were affected by these changes. China's shift from a closed-door state to a freewheeling money-making society is a testament to its ability to adapt to an evolving global landscape and a reminder of the power of economic growth to reshape societies and individual lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is content and excited at the same time, since the hostel, which he named after his best-seller A Decade of Backpacking, opened earlier this month. Published in 2010, Zhang's book was considered a milestone in Chinese travel writing. It sold more than 600,000 copies and triggered a wave of travel books by other Chinese writers who were born in the late 1970s and 1980s. Different from travel guides and traditional Chinese travel literature that mainly depict  landscapes and scenery, these books by young travelers tell stories of their personal growth through traveling. In A Decade of Backpacking, Zhang recounts his travels around the world since 2001, after he graduated from Nan Kai University in Tianjin and decided to see the world. \\"At the time my book came out, there were few books that catered to young people's longing while traveling.\\" Zhang's book ignited a Chinese craze for travel writing. Featuring different themes, travel writing became a popular genre. But most of the books have one thing in common: The travelers are mostly young people. The Late Gap Year (2009), written by Sun Dongchun, tells the story of a young man who gave up a white-collar job and started a three-month trip for a volunteer program in Southeast Asia. The trip turned into a year-long travel. What's more, he even found his Miss Right and got married by the end of the story. We Always Travel Hand in Hand, published in 2012, was written by a young couple. Their travel romance, complete with beautiful pictures, first went viral on a Chinese micro-blog.

But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading...

Aint  nothin luxe about the Luxor. From the outside and pics on the website, I thought it looked nice. The lower level where we checked in looked decent too. Once we got to our room though, it was a whole different story. A previous review mentioned that the room would have been cool in 1991. More like 1975. The ugly ass bedspread and curtains looked like they were straight off the set of Sanford & Son, Maude, All in the Family, and The Jeffersons, The bedspread was very cheap and flimsy. The actual bed was hard. The egyptian decor was cheesy. The only nice thing about it was the bathroom.  We stayed in east tower and there's a long walk to the room.  Our room also smelled like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room. My cousin is allergic to smoke so this was a big problem.When we called to complain about a possible room switch, they told us since they gave us a courtesy early check in, they couldn't switch us. Mmm kay, what does that have to do with a smoky room that we paid for not to smell like smoke? After several calls, they agreed to spray a \\"special air sanitizer\\" to get rid of the odor. That took forever. We also had to call several times to get them to bring extra towels/washcloths and pillows.  The a/c was horrible. It was up as high as it could go and didn't feel like it was even on.  The concierge was rude. Tons of annoying sales people trying to get you to buy timeshares and get 200 off another visit within 1 year. The catch? You have to put down a 100 deposit. Ha!  No information was given about how to get around Vegas. We actually went to Excalibur and talked to their concierge there. They gave us info. I definitely wouldn't stay here again.

Although Dominic and the early brethren had instituted female Dominican houses at Prouille and other places by 1227, some of the brethren of the order had misgivings about the necessity of female religious establishments in an order whose major purpose was preaching, a duty in which women could not traditionally engage. In spite of these doubts, women's houses dotted the countryside throughout Europe. There were seventy-four Dominican female houses in Germany, forty-two in Italy, nine in France, eight in Spain, six in Bohemia, three in Hungary, and three in Poland. Many of the German religious houses that lodged women had been home to communities of women, such as Beguines, that became Dominican once they were taught by the traveling preachers and put under the jurisdiction of the Dominican authoritative structure. A number of these houses became centers of study and mystical spirituality in the 14th century. There were one hundred and fifty-seven nunneries in the order by 1358. In that year, the number lessened due to disasters like the Black Death.

Sitting bottom of the Aviva Premiership, the Exiles are in desperate need of some comfort and joy. The statistics are damning. The Oxford club have suffered 10 defeats in 10 games and are in danger of becoming only the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory. These are new experiences for Piri Weepu, their World Cup winning scrum-half. His first three months in the Northern Hemisphere delivered more losses than nine seasons as a New Zealand international, but the veteran is not afraid of mucking in. Former All Blacks scrum half Piri Weepu dives to try and tackle Saracens' Chris Ashton last Saturday. ‘I’ve been in backs-to-the-wall situations before,’ said Weepu. ‘Leading into the World Cup, the All Blacks lost two games in a row. We were expected to win it but we kept focused on what we needed to achieve. ‘The circumstances are different here but we’ve just got to try to overcome it. People need to sell papers and they might talk rubbish about you to do that, but that doesn’t mean we have to buy into it. Comments in the tabloids can ruin your mood if you let them, but we just need to train our backsides off and stay positive.’ Saracens scored 11 tries against Welsh in the 78-7 win, the worst defeat the Exiles have suffered this year. Played 10, Lost 10. Points for 80, Against 490. Average possession per game: 14.41minutes. Goal kicking accuracy: 55%. Missed tackles per game: 28. Turnovers conceded per game: 15. Lineout success: 75%. Scrum success: 78%. Improvements are needed across the board. Welsh have managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season and have lost by an average of 41 points. They have fired in neither attack nor defence, but one of their most consistent downfalls has been at the set-piece. During their 78-7 defeat by Saracens on Saturday, they lost eight out of 13 lineouts on their own throw. Their scrum did not fare much better and, throughout the season, they have lost 20 per cent of ball on their own feed. This is compounded by an average concession of 15 turnovers per game, leaving the recently promoted side in desperate need of a morale boost. A victory over London Irish on Boxing Day would be the perfect festive tonic, with Irish sitting one place above Welsh in the league. Weepu, for one has not given up hope. Elliot Kear touches down a solitary consolation try for London Welsh, but Weepu insists they are improving. ‘If there’s no belief left, then we probably shouldn’t be in the competition,’ said the 31-year-old. ‘I still love the sport. I still love lacing up the boots and getting amongst it. Even if we’re getting pumped, I still love it. As long as you try your hardest, then that’s all we can really ask. We just need to get our roles right — we create opportunities in games but then we’re not picking the right options.’ Former Wales back row Rowland Phillips was brought in as a defence coach last month in a bid to turn around the club’s fortunes. A losing bonus point against Leicester showed signs of progress, but the Exiles still boast the worst tackle success rate in the league, missing an average of 28 per game. Phillips says there have been statistical improvements over the last seven weeks but is fully aware of the scale of the challenge. Despite the leakiest defence in the league, Rowland Phillips insists the defence is getting tougher. ‘There’s no fairy godmother who’s going to make everything perfect,’ said Phillips. ‘I joined this group about eight weeks ago and the timing meant I couldn’t just rip everything up and start again. It’s hard for me to convince people, but I have seen a certain improvement. There is hunger, but we’re not going to win on pure emotion. We need better structures to earn our right to win. The players know they have to improve and they want to improve.’ Phillips has been tasked with fixing the problems but the roots, he believes, stem from the short summer turnaround. The Exiles were rank outsiders for promotion but beat Bristol through the controversial play-off system. While Bristol had already recruited heavily for what seemed inevitable promotion, Welsh panicked in the transfer market place with sporadic recruitment, signing players on a shoestring budget. Weepu has bags of experience from his time with the All Blacks, and believes his side can turn things around. ‘Things happened pretty quickly,’ said Phillips. ‘The play-off season goes on late and the Premiership starts early, so our training and recruitment were affected by the preparation time. You’ve got a small window, with players coming off a tough Championship season. There’s about a one-week break and then you’re back in. That has a bearing on how your season unfolds. ‘Any gambling man would have bet on Bristol to walk into the Premiership, but it didn’t happen. Some say the system isn’t effective and there should be no promotion or relegation, but we’re trying to get away from a ring-fence mentality. Exeter are an example of a team who got promoted and grew. As soon as you close it off, then that kills off a lot of teams’ ambitions.’ The plight of London Welsh, it seems, will do little for the cause.","output":"London Welsh has faced severe challenges in the Aviva Premiership, with the team experiencing 10 defeats in 10 games. The situation leaves London Welsh in danger of becoming the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory. The Exiles have struggled in numerous aspects, with improvements needed across the board. Set-pieces have been particularly problematic, with several incidents during recent matches. The team has managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season, losing by an average of 41 points. A victory against London Irish may have provided a morale boost, but London Welsh still needs to work on numerous areas to avoid relegation. Defense, in particular, needs to be modified with former Wales back row Rowland Phillips being brought in as a defense coach last month. While Phillips claims there have been statistical improvements, much work remains to ensure better overall performance. Problems with the short summer turnaround and recruitment process have also contributed to the current challenges London Welsh is facing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite the dark world they live in, they're deeply in love and share a life of glamour and luxury together. Pitt, a rising crime lord from a rival mafia family, envies Murphy's success and is always on the lookout for an opportunity to undermine his power. He knows the only way to weaken Murphy is by taking away his one true vulnerability: Caroline.  The movie begins with a series of rapid-fire scenes that demonstrate Murphy's control over the city and his strategic prowess. Extremely cautious by nature, Murphy has managed to keep Caroline's existence and whereabouts a secret from his enemies.  However, during a seemingly trivial business deal with a street-level informant named Benny, Murphy slips up and reveals vital information about Caroline's whereabouts. Sensing an opportunity, Benny sells the information to Pitt. Taking advantage of this intelligence, Pitt devises a master plan to kidnap Caroline during a charity event she's hosting. In an intense and riveting sequence, Pitt and his henchmen successfully kidnap Caroline and send Murphy a chilling message: He must relinquish his control over the city or never see his beloved wife again. Murphy, fueled by rage and love, vows to unleash his full wrath upon Pitt and rescue Caroline, no matter the cost.

Options: a ) 5 , b ) 6 , c ) 9 , d ) 10 , e ) 15 Solution:","output":"Part #1: Identify the scholarships and their amounts Usage: There are three types of scholarships:  - 1250 scholarships: they total 75000 - 2500 scholarships: twice as many as 4000 scholarships - 4000 scholarships: the number needs to be determined I think these meet the criteria because they describe the information given in the problem. Part #2: Identify the relationships between the scholarships Usage: - Twice as many 2500 scholarships as 4000 scholarships - Three times as many 1250 scholarships as 2500 scholarships These ratios are stated in the problem, and they offer a link between the quantities of scholarships awarded in each denomination. Part #3: Determine the number of 1250 scholarships Usage: There were 60 1250 scholarships awarded, as (75000 div 1250 = 60). This information helps us to find the number of 2500 scholarships using the given relationship. Part #4: Determine the number of 2500 scholarships Usage: There were 20 2500 scholarships awarded, as (60 div 3 = 20). Since there are three times as many 1250 scholarships as 2500 scholarships, there must be 20 2500 scholarships given this factor. Part #5: Determine the number of 4000 scholarships Usage: There were 10 4000 scholarships awarded (option d). This number can be determined by dividing the number of 2500 scholarships (20) by 2, which is the factor given in the problem. Thus, the solution is d) 10 4000 scholarships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Process:  - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the weather is less windy happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"The perturbation of less windy weather may have an indirect effect on the process of ocean erosion. With less wind, there might be a decrease in wave energy, which can lead to smaller or less intense waves hitting the land. Consequently, this situation may somewhat reduce the force of the ocean water pulling sand off of beaches, breaking rocks off of cliffs, and carrying sand and rocks into the ocean. While less windy weather might seem to have a dampening effect on erosion, other factors can still contribute to the overall rate of erosion, such as the strength of ocean currents, tidal forces, and the geological composition of the land. So, in conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less windy weather may have an indirect effect on ocean erosion, but other factors can also influence the overall erosion process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - deep sea - slaughterhouse - cattle ranch - countryside - barnyard  Explain why a human would choose \\"cattle ranch\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"cattle ranch\\" A human would choose \\"cattle ranch\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most logical and relevant option among the choices provided. Cowboys were responsible for overseeing and tending to cattle, moving them from one location to another to ensure they had enough food, water, and could maintain overall well-being. A cattle ranch is a common place where such activities occur, as it is specifically designed to raise and manage cattle. Now, let's analyze the other choices: - \\"deep sea\\": This option is clearly unsuitable, as cows are land animals that cannot survive in a deep sea environment, and cowboys would not be found herding heifers in the ocean. - \\"slaughterhouse\\": While cattle are eventually sent to slaughterhouses for meat production, cowboys themselves are not typically the ones who herd them directly to the slaughterhouse. - \\"countryside\\": While cattle herding can occur in countryside settings, this option is very general and less specific than \\"cattle ranch.\\" Cowboys would typically not herd their cattle through public countryside areas without a specific destination. - \\"barnyard\\": A barnyard is a smaller area attached to a farm where animals are often kept. While cows may be housed in a barnyard, cowboys herd cattle over large distances, and a barnyard would not be a suitable destination for such activities. Considering all these reasons, \\"cattle ranch\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question, as it directly relates to the activities, responsibilities, and purpose of cowboys herding heifers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer to this question? who did fernando tatis hit 2 grand slams off of?","output":"Fernando Tatis Sr., former professional baseball player, is famously known for setting the Major League Baseball (MLB) record of hitting two grand slams in the same inning. This special accomplishment happened on April 23, 1999, while Tatis was playing for the St. Louis Cardinals in a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The pitcher from whom Tatis hit both grand slams was Chan Ho Park, who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers at that time. The remarkable event took place in the third inning of the game, and both home runs were a part of an 11-run scoring spree for the Cardinals, contributing eight of those 11 runs.  A grand slam refers to a home run that is hit when all three bases are occupied by runners, thus scoring four runs—the most possible on a single hit in baseball. What made Tatis' feat even more extraordinary was that it had never been done before in the history of Major League Baseball and has not been repeated since. Making this event even more astounding, Tatis hit his two grand slams on the first two pitches from Park, a testament to his abilities as a hitter and his impressive timing. His first slam came with no outs, and his second slam came with two outs. This remarkable achievement not only was a personal accomplishment for Tatis, but it also paved the way for the Cardinals' 12-5 victory over the Dodgers on that particular day. This event is an indelible part of baseball history and continues to be remembered as one of the most striking feats in the sport. Despite facing intense pressure, Park continued his career after that infamous game and even became the first South Korean-born player to be named an All-Star in the MLB in 2001. On the other hand, Fernando Tatis Sr.'s legacy in the sport continues, with his son Fernando Tatis Jr. also becoming a professional baseball player and continually impressing fans with his phenomenal performances.  So, to answer your question, Fernando Tatis Sr. hit 2 grand slams off of Chan Ho Park."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer??","output":"Alright, let's solve this step by step. First, start by simplifying the equation: -507 - 1081 = 25g + 48g + 18 Step 1: Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. -507 - 1081 = (-1588) (sum of -507 and -1081) 25g + 48g = 73g (sum of 25g and 48g) So now our equation looks like this: -1588 = 73g + 18 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'g' by moving the constant term from the right side to the left side. -1588 - 18 = 73g -1606 = 73g Step 3: Solve for 'g' by dividing both sides by 73. g = -1606 / 73 g ≈ -22 So, g is approximately equal to -22."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.      Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein \\"another step closer to accountability.\\"      The announcement came hours after Weinstein's lawyers said he'd decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare him and \\"political pressure\\" made an indictment unavoidable.      A statement issued through a Weinstein spokesman said the 66-year-old film producer, who has denied the allegations, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning himself in Friday. With a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not, his request for more time was denied, the statement said.      \\"Finally, Mr. Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein,\\" the statement said.      Vance said in a statement that the Weinstein camp's \\"recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable.\\"      \\"We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand,\\" Vance said.      Weinstein was charged Friday with raping one woman and committing a criminal sex act by compelling oral sex from another. A grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case, as it had been doing for weeks.      Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.      Freed on 1 million bail and electronic monitoring, he was due back in court July 30, though that date may now be moved up in light of the indictment.      Beyond the two women involved in the case, dozens more women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.      He has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Tuesday that Weinstein was \\"confident he's going to clear his name\\" in the New York prosecution.      Brafman called the rape allegation \\"absurd,\\" saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that began before and continued after the alleged 2013 attack.      The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators Weinstein confined her in a hotel room and raped her.      The other accuser in the case, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.      Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped her during a meeting.      Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded herself confronting Weinstein and him apologizing for his conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.      Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter. ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — The Latest on a New York rape case against Harvey Weinstein (all times local):      6:15 p.m.      Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says the former film producer will \\"vigorously defend\\" himself after being indicted on rape and other sex crime charges, which he strongly denies.

The Facebook photo, grainy and blurred, shows a boy in his Cub Scout uniform standing in the sun on the side of the road, his right arm in a stiff salute as cars pass by in Woodlawn, Virginia. The caption tells the rest of the story. Nine-year-old Lane Snow salutes the two-mile funeral procession Thursday for Virginia State Police Trooper Andrew Fox. The trooper, a graduate of Virginia Tech, was run over and killed while directing traffic at the state fair earlier this month. When the photo landed in Virginia Tech police Lt. George Jackson's inbox, he knew it would be a hit. Jackson manages the social media accounts for the college police department and posted the photo Friday in two places on the department's Facebook page. He asked fans to share the photo \\"and see how many likes we can get for this young Boy Scout and his tribute to Trooper Fox!\\" The first day, the image of Lane Snow's salute received 15,000 shares. The next day it had 45,000. By Tuesday it had been shared more than 68,000 times and growing, reaching an estimated 4 million people, according to Facebook's own analytics, Jackson told CNN. He had no explanation for the numbers of shares except to say the comments reveal a community who supported Snow's character. Lane Snow didn't know trooper Fox, but he told local station WDBJ7 he did it because \\"I was sorry that Andrew Fox died.\\" Snow's parents told the station he came up with the idea to dress in uniform and salute the procession on his own. Everyone who saw it was touched, including Fox's widow, who saw Snow saluting as her car passed, WDBJ reported. It was a pure and touching gesture, Jackson said. In an interview with CNN, Jackson said he wanted to bring awareness and attention to the state police and Fox's family as a measure of support. \\"I just remembered how it felt to have lost an officer. The community rallied around us,\\" Jackson said. At Snow's Cub Scout meeting Monday night, 10 officers from various agencies -- some of whom knew Fox personally -- showed up to thank Snow in person, said Cub Master Darrell Lineberry. Lane Snow told the local station that he wants to be a policeman when he grows up, \\"just like Andrew Fox.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about a 9-year-old boy named Lane Snow who did something very special to honor a police officer.

Article: People and the sources of air pollution are found in the same places. This means that cities with large populations have the biggest problem of dirty air. Air pollution is caused by many different things. A major source of air pollution is the gas fumes from cars. Statistics show that 93 percent of all auto trips are within cities. Another major source of dirty air is the burning of coal and oil for energy. This energy is needed to make electricity. Of course, much more electricity is used in the city than in the country. On the average, we throw away more trash and garbage than the year before. The burning of garbage contributes to air pollution. Many major industries are also responsible for the dirty air in the around cities. The fumes from iron, steel, chemical, and petroleum production add particles to the air. The effects of air pollution range from mild headaches to death. The levels of pollution found in heavy for traffic may cause headaches for loss of clear vision. Wherever coal and oil are used for fuel, fumes may kill trees and plants and cause metal to corrode.

Write an article based on this \\"Select the fish you want to breed. Select the breeding tank. Set up the tank. Adjust the tank for your fish’s needs. Place the guppies in the breeding tank. Know when your fish is about to give birth.\\"","output":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Breeding Fish: An Emphasis on Guppies Intro: Breeding fish at home can be a rewarding hobby, yielding an explosion of life and color in an aquarium. The process, however, requires careful planning and preparedness to ensure the health and well-being of the fish during and after breeding. In this guide, we’ll dive into the intricate process using guppies as an example, given their popularity and ease of breeding among hobbyists. Step 1: Selecting the Fish The first decision involves determining the type of fish you wish to breed. For this guide, we've opted for guppies, common favorites in the aquarium hobby due to their vibrant colors and live-bearing feature. When selecting your guppies, pay attention to their health, age, and sex. Typically, a ratio of one male to two females is ideal to avoid the males from harassing a single female. Step 2: Choosing the Breeding Tank The breeding tank is the next critical component. The size, shape, and furniture of the tank can significantly affect breeding success. For guppies, a standard 10-20 gallon aquarium provides ample space. It’s advisable to include live plants for hiding spots and to detract attention away from the females during mating. Step 3: Setting Up the Tank Tank setup involves preparing the physical and chemical properties of the aquarium to mirror the fish's natural habitat. Begin with a clean tank, add dechlorinated water, and include an appropriate filter system. Layer the bottom with a fine substrate and introduce live plants for hiding spaces and for providing a natural ecosystem.  Step 4: Adjusting the Tank to Your Fish’s Needs Considering guppies originate from calm, warm, tropical waters, replicating this environment is crucial to encourage breeding. Ensure the tank conditions are optimal, with water temperatures between 74°F and 82°F, and a neutral pH around 7.0. A gentle water flow would help mimic their natural river habitats. Regular light exposure, mimicking a day-night cycle, and maintaining a balanced diet for your fish can also contribute to their breeding willingness and overall health.   Step 5: Introducing the Guppies to the Breeding Tank Once the tank conditions are ideal, introduce the selected guppies gently into their new habitat. Avoid adding them all at once and consider isolating the males and females initially for a stress-free acclimatization process.  Step 6: Observing Signs of Impending Birth One of the most exciting parts of breeding guppies is anticipating their live birth. Guppies, being livebearers, do not lay eggs. Females show a prominent gravid spot near their anal fin, which darkens as she nears birth. A well-rounded belly and distinct change in behavior such as isolation could intimate that your guppy is close to having her fry. In conclusion, breeding guppies, or any fish for that matter, requires careful preparation and a nurturing environment. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to accomplish this task, but remember that patience and attention to detail are critical components to virtue in the delightful journey of fish breeding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It includes 4,000 fixed seats and a 95,000-square-foot (8,800 m2) Great Lawn that can accommodate an additional 7,000 people. The pavilion was built above and behind the Harris Theater, which has the benefit that Millennium Park's indoor and outdoor performance venues share a loading dock, rehearsal rooms and other backstage facilities.The bandshell's brushed stainless steel headdress frames the 120-foot (37 m) proscenium theatre; the main stage can accommodate a full orchestra and chorus of 150 members. The bandshell is connected to a trellis of interlocking crisscrossing steel pipes that support the innovative sound system, which mimics indoor concert hall acoustics. The pavilion has restrooms on both its east and west sides. It is one of two features in the park to include accessible restrooms; the other is McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The majority of the park's 123 toilet fixtures (78 for women, 45 for men) are located in underground arcades to the east and west of the pavilion, with the ones on the east being heated for winter use.Millennium Park is built on top of a large underground parking garage.

Article: What is an idiom? An idiom is a group of words which, when used together, has a different meaning from the one which the individual words have. For example, \\"---How do you know that Sid and Nancy have separated ?\\" \\"---I heard it on the grapevine \\". Of course, the second speaker does not mean he heard the news about John by putting his ear to a grapevine! He is conveying the idea visually of information spreading around a widespread network, similar to a grapevine. We use idioms to express something that other words do not express as clearly or as cleverly. We often use an image or symbol to describe something as clearly as possible and thus make our point as effectively as possible. For example, \\"in a nutshell\\" suggests the idea of having all the information contained within very few words. Idioms tend to be informal and are best used in spoken rather than written English. One of the best ways to learn an idiom is by looking at the context in which it is used. This can be done by concentrating on the rest of the sentence and try to guess the meaning. Many idioms are not that difficult to understand when considered in their context. For example: We are going to have a surprise party for Tom tomorrow. It's a secret so please don't let the cat out of the bag. 'Let the cat out of the bag' is an idiom. Imagine you don't know what this idiom means; by looking at the words preceding, it should be easy to guess that the speaker does not want you to tell Tom about the surprise party. Therefore, 'let the cat out of the bag' must mean something like' reveal a secret' or 'tell a secret'.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  Paragraph: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? The answer to this question is:","output":"Area B was more oxygenated. According to the paragraph provided, Area A exhibited high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the Danube River. In contrast, Area B, located 35 miles south, had less stratified and more oxygenated water. Water stratification can lead to the formation of distinct layers with varied properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature. These layers act as barriers to water mixing, which can result in decreased oxygen levels in certain parts of the water column, specifically the lower depths. Consequently, regions with less stratification, such as Area B in this scenario, tend to have better oxygenation due to enhanced mixing throughout the entire water column."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where could she go to find a big cat to see? - front door - residence - zoo - restaurant - barn  The best answer is","output":"The best answer is the zoo. A zoo is the ideal location for someone to see a big cat up close, as it provides a controlled environment where these magnificent creatures are housed, cared for, and protected. Zoos not only endeavor to create a comfortable habitat for the animals but also work towards global conservation and breeding programs for endangered species. Many zoos today are shifting their focus to prioritize animal welfare, and education of visitors is also an integral part of their mission. Some of the big cats one can expect to see at a zoo include lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. These are all apex predators in their respective ecosystems, and seeing them up close can provide a better understanding and appreciation of these powerful and beautiful creatures. Visiting the front door or a residence might not present the opportunity to see a big cat, as these are private spaces where the occupants may not own any such animals. It is also important to recognize that keeping big cats as pets can be highly dangerous and, in many places, illegal due to the risks involved. A restaurant is similarly an unlikely location to encounter a big cat since their focus is primarily on providing food and dining experiences to patrons. Big cats require specialized care and facilities that restaurants are not equipped to handle. Lastly, visiting a barn might also prove ineffective, as barns are usually associated with domesticated farm animals like horses, cows, pigs, and chickens. While it is not impossible for someone to keep a big cat in a barn, it is highly unlikely given the requirements for specialized care, resources, and the need for an enclosed habitat. In conclusion, the best option for someone interested in seeing a big cat is to visit a zoo, where these beautiful animals are housed in specialized enclosures with professionals attending to their needs. Zoos also provide educational programs and opportunities for visitors to learn about big cats and other wildlife, promoting understanding and conservation efforts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: What group was Ray Holmes part of? Context: On 15 September 1940, known as the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.  Question: \\"Tocqueville's two best known works examine political life in what two countries?\\" Response: \\"The Old Regime\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Tara Maclay is a fictional character created for the action-horror/fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed by Amber Benson. Tara is a shy young woman with magical talents who falls in love with Willow Rosenberg, one of the core characters. Together, they help Buffy Summers, who has been given superhuman powers to defeat evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Tara becomes more outspoken during the sixth season about the ethics of Willow's use of magic, cautioning Willow that she depends too much on it. The dynamics of their relationship suddenly turn during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". Willow had cast a spell on Tara to alter her memory in the preceding episode and Tara finds out about it during \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the musical episode of the series. Tara was given a prominent role in the musical due to the skill of Benson's voice: she sings a love ballad to Willow, a duet with Giles, and backup in two other songs. The musical nature of the episode compelled the characters to express what they had been feeling secretly, or had refused to admit to themselves. Tara's song is a fervent and explicit expression of love for Willow which she had not made clear to the audience until this point. Tara later sings with Giles that she will leave Willow if she does not change. Self-conscious about her singing abilities, Hannigan requested not to be given a song and sings only a few lines in the episode. Critics saw this as Tara's personality becoming more forceful as Willow begins to show signs of weakness as she is overtaken by her addiction. Tara challenges Willow to go for a week without using any magic. Willow almost immediately breaks her promise, however, and Tara leaves her at the end of \\"Tabula Rasa\\". Tara remains a part of the group, spending time with Dawn, and non-judgmentally acting as Buffy's confessor when Buffy divulges she has a painful and compulsive sexual relationship with Spike, a vampire whom she loathes.  Despite their separation, Tara remains devoted to Willow's recovery and supports her in her decision to abstain from using magic. She is, according to author Lorna Jowett, one of the few characters who is never seduced by evil. Shuttleworth notes that most Buffy characters go through a rite of transformation except for Tara. Among female characters she is the most virtuous. Like the other Buffy characters in the series whose names have symbolic interpretations, Tara's name resembles the Latin terra, meaning \\"earth.\\" She is solidly grounded, with Willow attached to her, and Benson's body more naturally representative of women. Tara is wholly feminine both in dress and demeanor, as opposed to Buffy and (less) Willow mostly dressed with trousers and jackets, but never seeks male approval. She is clad in earthy, natural colors, long flowing skirts and clinging blouses, with an intent to comfort instead of arouse as other women on the show are dressed. Her admonishments to other characters are always made with love, with their best interests at heart. Even Tara's last words, commenting that Willow's shirt is stained (with Tara's own blood), indicate her preoccupation with the welfare of others.  Tara has also appeared in The Long Way Home, Always Darkest, Retreat, and the one-off Willow.

In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

The Terrified Witness[edit] Under heavy police protection, gangster Joe Rico (Ted de Corsia) arrives late at night at the courthouse to testify against crime lord Albert Mendoza (Everett Sloane). There have been several attempts on Rico's life and he is a bag of nerves, but lead prosecutor ADA Martin Ferguson (Humphrey Bogart) reminds him that he himself faces plenty of charges that could \\"burn you a dozen times\\". Ferguson is bound and determined to get Mendoza \\"in the electric chair\\" and stresses to Rico that Mendoza will \\"die, he's got to die, and you're going to kill him.\\" After yet another attempt on his life, Rico gives his bodyguards the slip and tries to escape by reaching the fire escape on the eighth floor of the building, but he falls off the ledge and is killed on impact when he hits the courtyard. Rico was the only evidence Ferguson had against Mendoza, who will walk away in the morning as a free man. However, he believes that something else came up in the course of the investigation that might make the caseâif only he could remember it. He and police Capt.

At the crime scene, which is out in the countryside, the police find an empty grave. Malloy, overcome with grief, bitterly explains that his girlfriend was a \\"contract\\" and a \\"hit\\", terms which mean nothing to the officers. He later commits suicide in his cell. Ferguson, the ADA in charge of homicide, is brought in on the case.

Summarize this article: Teacher's killer gets life By Kirk Mitchell and Howard Pankratz      Denver Post Staff Writers            Nov. 4, 2000 - A Denver teenager was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole just hours after a jury convicted him of killing schoolteacher Emily Johnson. \\"It's just too bad that one stupid, stupid night had to ruin so many lives,\\" said a tearful Marcy Johnson, Emily's sister. TYPES OF MURDER A Denver jury convicted 15-year-old Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr. on Friday of felony murder, not finding enough evidence of premeditation. The two types of first-degree murder in Colorado: Murder after deliberation Felony murder To prove premeditated murder, or murder after deliberation, prosecutors must convince a jury that a defendant not only intended to cause the death of another person but that he or she acted after deliberation. To prove felony murder, prosecutors must show that during the commission of a felony - specifically, arson, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, or sexual assault - or while escaping from such a crime, a person died.      After 14 hours of deliberations that had erupted in shouting matches, jurors convicted 15-year-old Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr. of first-degree felony murder, robbery, auto theft and burglary. The slight, wiry boy with a crew cut sat slouching with head bowed, his eyes red from crying. Denver District Judge Lawrence Manzanares took the unusual step of immediately sentencing him to mandatory life in prison, plus 10 more years for robbery and four concurrent years for auto theft. Police say Montoya and two other teens attacked Johnson, 29, in her northwest Denver home on New Year's Day. They went to her house to steal her Lexus and go joy riding, and when she wouldn't hand over her keys, they beat her with rocks and her own high-heeled shoes, police say. A neighbor found the Skinner Middle School special-education teacher and girls' basketball coach on her back patio the next morning covered in blood. She died 36 hours later. Charges were dropped against one of the suspects, but 17-year-old Nicholas David Martinez faces trial in February. \\"Oh my God, oh my baby,\\" Montoya's mother, Mary Torres, wailed as sheriff's deputies led away her son. \\"Our juvenile justice system has evolved to this: Lock 'em up and throw away the key,\\" said Montoya's attorney, Gina Bischofs. \\"It's compounding the horrible tragedy to Emily Johnson.\\" Jury foreman Mark Meigs said deliberations were emotional. \\"It was real trying, and a lot of the jury didn't want to be here after the second day,\\" he said. \\"We told each other we had to keep it together and have faith we could do the right thing.\\" He said the gruesome details of the crime, spelled out over the weeklong trial, were troubling. \\"The evidence was gory,\\" Meigs said. \\"They had sleepless nights.\\" He said jurors didn't believe witnesses who tried to provide Montoya with an alibi. Those witnesses said Montoya was at his girlfriend's brother's house watching videos and then watching fireworks. Meigs also said jurors believed the testimony of Matthew Hernandez, a 16-year-old cellmate of Montoya. Hernandez said Montoya told him all about the attack. Still, Meigs, the father of four children ages 10 to 18, said it was difficult to send Montoya to prison for the rest of his life. Montoya was ineligible for the death penalty because he's under 18 \\"You wonder what was going on in his life and his family,\\" Meigs said. \\"A lot of jurors had sympathy for him because he just didn't seem like that kind of kid.\\" Judge Manzanares agreed Montoya wasn't the ringleader but he was still culpable. Neither Montoya nor any of his family addressed the court on his behalf before the sentencing. Montoya, who was 14 at the time of the attack, confessed to police that he and some friends had gone to Johnson's house to steal her car. He gave police a two-hour, detailed statement about the attack, saying he was so high on marijuana he didn't know what he was doing. But jurors never got to hear about the bulk of the interview. Manzanares had ruled it inadmissible because the boy's mother wasn't present for about 90 minutes of the questioning. In the police interview, Montoya said he, Martinez and a third youth broke into Johnson's house through the back door by ripping off boards that covered the milk chute. Hernandez testified that Montoya told him the youths forced their way in through the front door. The teens stomped on Johnson's hands and wrists after she refused to give up the car keys, threatening to kill her if she wouldn't hand them over, Hernandez testified. Johnson was then dragged outside, beaten with a softball-size rock and left for dead. Her attackers fled in her newly purchased 1994 Lexus ES300. Montoya's fingerprint was found on the car. Prosecutors also said Montoya left behind the bright-orange Broncos jacket he was wearing that night and that his shoes left footprints in Johnson's blood. Deputy District Attorney Curt Alfrey said if Montoya and his accomplices had stopped the attack after beating Johnson into unconsciousness, she might have lived. But they dragged her out of the house and smashed her head with a large rock, he said. \\"The decision sealed her fate,\\" he said. \\"After everything that happened, they still stole the car.\\" Staff writer Cindy Brovsky contributed to this report.

Return to top ||||| A man sentenced to life in prison after he allegedly was coerced at age 14 into confessing to the infamous murder of a teacher has sued Denver and various police officers in federal court for 30 million, citing civil rights violations.      Lawrence Rubin Montoya, 31, served 13 years, seven months and 13 days in prison “for a crime he didn’t commit” before his release in 2014 after his conviction was overturned in the death of Denver school teacher Emily Johnson.      Montoya was sentenced to life in prison even though no physical evidence tied him to the scene of the crime, according to the lawsuit.      New York City attorneys Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, David N. Fisher and Kaitlin F. Nares filed the 77-page lawsuit in Denver federal court late Tuesday seeking compensatory and punitive damages, economic losses and attorneys fees. They are requesting a trial by jury.      Johnson was beaten to death after attending a 1999 New Year’s Eve party at Liquid nightclub. She returned home at 2:10 a.m. in a white Lexus that was stolen. A neighbor found her in her backyard barely breathing at 8:30 a.m. Jan. 1, 2000. She had been raped and severely beaten. She died of her injuries.      Between 2:10 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Montoya was at the home of his girlfriend at 4160 Ames St. and was not involved, the lawsuit says.      Homicide detectives took Montoya to police headquarters at 8 p.m. Jan. 10, 2000, and interviewed him for 2½ hours, during which time he denied 65 times being in Johnson’s home or having anything to do with the murder.      But after detectives Martin Vigil and Michael Martinez and former police Lt. Jonathan Priest used techniques including “false evidence ploy, manipulation, minimization, threats, false promises,” Montoya succumbed to the pressure and confessed falsely, the lawsuit says.      According to the lawsuit, during the interview, detectives cornered Lawrence against the wall in his chair, got in his face, banged the table, yelled at him, stood over him, told him he was not going home, told him he was going to prison for life and that he should be afraid and that he should say goodbye to his mother.      Montoya’s confessions were the sole basis for probable cause in his arrest on Jan. 11, 2000, the lawsuit says. Although Johnson’s attack was very violent, leaving blood all over her house and the yard, none of his blood, fiber, hair or palm prints were found at the scene, it says.      “Having coerced Lawrence‘s confession and with no evidence, whatsoever, connecting Lawrence to Emily Johnson‘s assault and subsequent death, or the theft of her car, in concert or conspiracy, defendants maliciously and baselessly caused Lawrence to be arrested and prosecuted with the serious charges of felony murder, aggravated robbery, first degree burglary and aggravated vehicle theft,” the lawsuit says.      He was sentenced to life without parole Nov. 3, 2000. After professing his innocence thereafter in a series of appeals, Montoya’s charges were dismissed on June 16, 2014.      He pleaded guilty the same day to accessory after the fact, admitting he was in the stolen Lexus later in the day on Jan. 1, 2000, and did not go to authorities when other suspects told him they hit a lady with a rock, the lawsuit says. He had been inside the car for 20 minutes “joyriding” with several others who were not arrested in the murder, the lawsuit says.      Nicholas Martinez, Luke Anaya and Lloyd Martinez and not Montoya murdered Johnson, the lawsuit says. ||||| DENVER (CBS4) – A man walked out of prison Monday after a court in Denver vacated his murder conviction.      Lorenzo Montoya, 29, was convicted nearly 14 years ago in the murder of a Denver teacher. Now with a plea deal Montoya was set free after his lawyers say new evidence cast doubt on his guilt.      Only CBS4 was on hand as Montoya hugged his mother as a free man.      Montoya’s life sentence for the murder of 29-year-old Emily Johnson in 2000 was vacated in exchange for his pleading guilty to accessory to murder. Johnson was a special education teacher at Skinner Middle School in northwest Denver.      “He was 14 at the time of the murder and was accused of accompanying 16-year-old co-defendant Nicholas Martinez, 30, in what began as an effort to steal Johnson’s car, but ended in her murder,” Lynn Kimbrough with the Denver District Attorney’s Office said.      According to Kimbrough, “Johnson’s family, the original prosecutors on the case and others involved in the investigation, determined that allowing Montoya to plead guilty to being accessory was in the interest of justice.”      Kimbrough said Johnson’s family said they wanted to “speak with Emily’s voice and heart, and that she would want Montoya to have another chance.”      After the plea deal Montoya was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Since he already served nearly 14 years he was immediately released.      Defense attorney Lisa Polanski had been working on Montoya’s case since 2011 when she took the case on pro bono.      “He was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted,” Polanski told CBS4. “He didn’t trust the system at all.”      The district attorney’s office refutes Polanski’s claim that Montoya was wrongfully convicted, however.      “He declined a plea offer in 2000 that would have resulted in a 6-year sentence to the Youthful Offender System. Instead, he took his case to trial, as was his right, and he was found guilty of felony murder,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement. “The accusation was that he had been the lookout and knew that he was in the victim’s stolen car and that she had been attacked. In fact, Mr. Montoya admitted this.”      In a 91-page petition for a new trial Polanski argued that the then 14-year-old’s attorney failed him and new evidence proved his innocence.      “We had done some DNA testing on some physical evidence and found that it exonerated our client,” Polanski said.      The district attorney’s office also disagreed with Polanski saying, “This is not a DNA exoneration case. There were no court proceedings that litigated any new DNA evidence.”      “We always believed he was lookout,” Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said.      Morrissey says instead of a new trial Montoya agreed to plead guilty to accessory to murder since he admitted to being inside the Johnson’s stolen car the next day.      “We felt that this was a just result in this situation,” Morrissey said.      “This was essentially a compromise in order to get my client out free where he should be,” Palanski said.      Montoya was one of the about 50 cases in Colorado of juveniles convicted to life behind bars — a sentence now deemed unconstitutional. Those inmates’ cases are currently awaiting a decision from the Colorado Supreme Court. |||||","output":"In November 2000, Lorenzo Rubin Montoya Jr., a 15-year-old Denver teenager, was convicted of first-degree felony murder, robbery, auto theft, and burglary, resulting in a life sentence without parole. Montoya was found guilty for the murder of schoolteacher Emily Johnson after he and two other teens allegedly attacked her and stole her car. Shortly after the trial, Montoya confessed to several aspects of the crime while in jail. Although he was ineligible for the death penalty due to being under 18, Montoya received a heavy sentence due to the heinous nature of the crimes. In a dramatic turn of events, Montoya's original conviction was vacated in 2014 after new evidence cast doubt on his guilt, and his life sentence was changed to a 10-year sentence upon pleading guilty to being an accessory to murder. By this point, Montoya had already served nearly 14 years in prison and was subsequently released. Montoya's lawyers, who worked pro bono on his case since 2011, maintain that he was falsely accused and wrongfully convicted. The District Attorney's Office contends that while Montoya might not have directly killed Johnson, he was at least an accessory in the crime, thus justifying the amended conviction and sentence. Montoya's case highlights the complexities and nuances of the criminal justice system, particularly in situations where a young defendant's guilt is not entirely clear-cut. Society must grapple with the balance between administering appropriate punishment and providing opportunities for redemption for those convicted of such serious crimes at a young age."},{"instruction":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Andy Kelp seeks his brother-in-law to aid in a job for who?  After John Dortmunder is released from his latest stint in prison, he is approached by his brother-in-law, Andy Kelp, about another job. Dr. Amusa seeks a valuable gem in the Brooklyn Museum that is of great significance to his people in his country in Africa, stolen during colonial times and then re-stolen by various African nations. Dortmunder and Kelp are joined by driver Stan Murch and explosives expert Allan Greenberg, concocting an elaborate plan to steal the gem. Although the scheme (and each subsequent one) is carefully planned—and keeps increasing in cost—something always goes awry, and the quartet has to steal the diamond again and again. First off, the diamond is swallowed by Greenberg when he alone gets caught by the museum guards during the initial heist. Dortmunder, Kelp, and Murch, at the urging of Greenberg's rotund father Abe, a lawyer, help Greenberg escape from state prison, but they then find he does not have the diamond. After Greenberg tells his partners he hid the rock in the police station (after bodily evacuating it), the quartet break into the precinct jail by helicopter, but the rock is not where Greenberg hid it. Greenberg discloses that his father Abe was the only other person who knew where it was. It isn't until Murch, disguised as the grunting muscle man \\"Chicken,\\" threatens Abe with being thrown down an elevator shaft, that Abe gives up the location of the diamond—his safe deposit box, and he also gives up the key to it.

I will help you solve this equation step by step, and I'll try to make it simple so it's easy to understand! We have the equation: -21 * u + 34 = 27 * u - 158 First, we need to gather all the \\"u\\" terms on one side, and the numbers on the other side. So, let's move the -21 * u to the right side and the -158 to the left side.  To move -21 * u, we will add 21 * u to both sides: -21 * u + 21 * u + 34 = 27 * u + 21 * u - 158 This simplifies to: 34 = 48 * u - 158 Now, let's move the -158 to the left side by adding 158 to both sides: 34 + 158 = 48 * u This simplifies to: 192 = 48 * u Now, we need to find the value of \\"u\\". To do this, we will divide both sides by 48: 192 ÷ 48 = 48 * u ÷ 48 This simplifies to: 4 = u So, the value of \\"u\\" is 4!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter.  John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state.  In which state the distance between particles are smaller, state B or state C? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, John is examining three states of matter: state A (solid), state B (liquid), and state C (gas). When comparing state B (liquid) and state C (gas), we can analyze the properties of each state based on the distance between their respective particles. The distance between particles is significantly affected by the state of matter. In the solid state, particles are held tightly together in a fixed, rigid structure, resulting in relatively small distances between them. The liquid state allows for more mobility, as particles are able to move and slide past each other within the confines of a fixed volume. While the distances between particles in a liquid state are still relatively small, they are larger than the distances in the solid state. In contrast, the gaseous state exhibits the greatest distance between particles. These particles move freely and independently, without any specific or fixed structure. Gas particles occupy the entire available space of their container, spreading out and expanding as necessary. Due to this lack of structure and increased freedom of movement, the distances between particles in the gaseous state are considerably larger than those found in the solid and liquid states. Based on this analysis, the distance between particles is smaller in state B (liquid) than it is in state C (gas). The particles in state B are more closely packed together compared to the particles in state C, which are dispersed more loosely throughout the available space."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Question: What land mass are the killer whales nearest? Options: - not enough information   - San Juan Islands   - Fishing village of Steveston   - Vancouver === The correct answer is","output":"San Juan Islands. The sighting of a killer whale (orca) can be rare, but their love for hunting and playing in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle make them visible occasionally. Whale watching is a sought-after activity for tourists visiting this region, and the quaint historic fishing village of Steveston, just south of Vancouver, provides an ideal starting point for such whale watching excursions. By hopping aboard a boat, you can spend the day cruising the coast in search of whales, other marine mammals, and seabirds. The calm and soothing ride can easily lull one into a meditative state, offering a perfect opportunity to zone out from modern day dilemmas. As the boat heads south past the Canadian/American border, it enters the region of the San Juan Islands, which is home to the most studied killer whales in the world. Humans have observed these whales for thousands of years, while the whales, in turn, have been known to observe humans as well. These whales live in stable family groups called pods, which represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and massive bulls. Each family member can be recognized by their distinctive markings and can live as long as a human.

News article: What Obama's gun agenda really means for Americans This is a rush transcript from \\"Hannity,\\" February 4, 2013. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Our \\"campaigner in chief\\" pounds the pavement yet once again like it's election season. He is desperately trying to push through stricter gun control laws. \\"The anointed one\\" with his soaring rhetoric took his case today to the people of Minnesota and made one thing loud and clear about his gun control policies -- it's not a perfect solution. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There won't be perfect solutions, we're not going to save every life, but we can make a difference. That is our responsibility as Americans. That is what I'll do every single day as long as I've got the honor of serving as your president. HANNITY: Not a perfect solution. Now make no mistake about what Obama is doing today. It's a blatant move to undercut the NRA. He is trying to directly appeal to their membership, and as he spoke in front of the Minneapolis Police Department claiming gun owners support his common sense gun control measures. Now it's senseless arguments like this that literally do nothing to advance even his cause. OBAMA: If we still had a ten round limit on magazines, for example, the gunman who shot Gabby may never have been able to inflict 33 gunshot wounds in 15 seconds -- 15 seconds, 33 rounds fired. Some of the six people who lost their lives that day in Tucson might still be with us. HANNITY: All right, there is no way that he can draw that conclusion. Mr. President, that is what we call rampant speculation. Now the president is pressing for a ban on military-style firearms and universal background checks for gun buyers. By the way, something the NRA vehemently claims is nothing more than a way to punish good law abiding citizens. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \\"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\\") WAYNE LAPIERRE, EXECUTIVE V.P., CEO, NRA: It's a fraud to call it universal. It will never be universal. The criminals aren't going to comply with it. They could care less. You are not going to computerize the mental health records. Here's what's going to happen. We ought to quick calling it a universal check. The real title ought to be, the check on law abiding people all over this country. HANNITY: All right, two things to take away from his campaign today and what was nothing short of a stunt. One, what you are seeing is an opportunistic president attempting to push through legislation that may look good, but clearly does not need to make sense. Now number two, this is a president who continues to have misplaced priorities. Where is the same attention and intensity when it comes to the lack of jobs and 50 million Americans on food stamps? Now we learned last week that the economy actually was shrinking and unemployment is back up to 7.9 percent. And as all this news is pouring out, here is what the president is addressing. OBAMA: I am here today because the time has come for common sense, comprehensive immigration reform. OBAMA: My attitude is that gays and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybo dy else does in every institution and walk of life. OBAMA: The only way we can reduce gun violence in this country is if the American people decide it is important, if you decide it is important. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, hunters and sportsman, Americans of every background stand up and say it's got to be different. HANNITY: Here, of course, with reaction, author and columnist, the one and only, Ann Coulter. By the way, did you see the picture of the president skeet shooting, which he finally revealed? Notice, first of all when you skeet shooting you shoot up. Number one, he is not even holding it right. ANN COULTER, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST: No I think he has someone holding the clay for him. The great constitutional law scholar apparently believes the Second Amendment is because the framers of the Constitution really like skeet shooting. No, that is not what it is about. Waiting for the photos of him taking birth control pills to show him fighting the war on women. HANNITY: All right, let's go to what is interesting here. The president right now only wants to talk about -- gay scout masters, apparently accepting gay scout masters, gay marriage, gun control, watering down welfare requirements, abortion rights, war on women. Everything but the bad economy. Strategic, purposeful? COULTER: Yes, but I would like to concentrate on the lies being repeated on the op-ed page of The New York Times and editorials why the president himself, he says if we want to do something to reduce these gun shootings all we have to do is for the American people to want to do something like the hunters. No, we need the ACLU and the liberals who will not do anything about the mentally ill to be serious about stopping these shootings. This kid that was kidnapped in Alabama and finally released today, that was crazy man that took him. Everyone knew he was crazy. The American sniper, this great American male, more American shots at the enemy than any other military man, he was killed by a man with a history of mental problems. HANNITY: Oh by the way, he listens to conservative talk radio. COULTER: Connecticut, Aurora, Tucson, these are crazy people. That is the problem. Everything they are telling you about what they can do about guns is lie. The problem with universal background checks is we basically have universal backgrounds check now. Any licensed gun dealer is performing a background check. The buyer may not know or the gun show may not know, but if you are walking through a gun show, everybody is doing background checks. The only people who are not subjected to background checks are collectors, giving guns to their sons or selling one to their brother in law or something. The only way to enforce a universal -- the last 0.1 percent of guns that are transferred by collectors and so on is to have universal gun registration. That is an important point. For some reason, Wayne Lapierre is not making it so you're going to have to hear it from me. Universal background check means universal registration, universal registration means universal confiscation, universal extermination. That is how it goes in history. Do not fall for universal background checks. Point two of this thing about how in The New York Times editorial page today or yesterday and from the hearings last week, that a gun in the home is more likely to be used against the owner than to kill an intruder. Two points about that. The whole thing is a lie. That is because most ways a gun in the home is used to kill someone is suicide. That is more than 90 percent of those cases. You might say, having a gun they are going to commit suicide and they wouldn't have otherwise. No, that is false. Suicide rates do not go up with the availability of guns. The Japanese for example have no guns. They have twice the highest suicide rate. You see the same thing state to state. No matter what gun laws are, suicide rates have nothing to do with that. And finally, what we only count, a homeowner repelling an intruder if he murders him and kills him? How about he holds them until the police arrive. That doesn't count in the equation. That is why they are telling you in order to prevent Americans from self-defense, from protecting themselves, so only the government has a monopoly on guns. HANNITY: Let me ask you, because I think it fits with the narrative. If Obama talks about gay rights, if Obama talks about guns, immigration and climate control, then the media race to every Republican, \\"What do you think about what Obama said?,\\" and we don't focus on the economy. One other issue -- COULTER: Not only that just to follow up on your point right there. It's just that they are talking about it, they must demonize people that are legal gun owners and, \\"Obama, look at him. He cares about the children.\\" Screw you. You think we don't care about the children? You're the one who won't do anything about the mentally ill. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.

Article: In the past, if a person wanted to see the national treasures of a country, one had to go there in person. Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts  . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints  . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization.

Context: There is disagreement about the origin of the term, but general consensus that \\"cardinalis\\" from the word cardo (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In Rome the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean “principal,” “eminent,” or \\"superior.\\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \\"title\\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of a synod of 769, only a cardinal was eligible to become pope. In 1059, during the pontificate of Nicholas II, cardinals were given the right to elect the pope under the Papal Bull In nomine Domini. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but the Third Lateran Council in 1179 gave back the right to the whole body of cardinals. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope Innocent IV in 1244.","output":"Before 1059, a cardinal was eligible to become pope, as decreed by a synod in 769."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Jon Krakauer will release Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town on April 21. For his next book, Jon Krakauer looked into a series of campus rapes at the University of Montana after he learned that a close family friend had been raped by a man she trusted. Mr Krakauer announced Monday that he would release 'Missoula: Rape and the Justice System In a College Town' on April 21. The best-selling author says that the story 'makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault'. He has previously written narrative non-fiction about topical issues, including a biography of football player and soldier Pat Tillman. The book's release in April follows several years where sexual assaults and how they are handled by universities have gotten increased attention. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012, according to Mr Krakauer's website. The Colorado-based journalist says the new book 'chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula' with both the police system and their university. The book purportedly tells how one district attorney testified for an alleged rapist during university proceedings against him. She later left the prosecutor's office, becoming an attorney for the university's star football player who was accused on rape. The Department of Justice began an investigation into Missoula County in May 2012 after receiving complaints about the way officials handled rapes reported by University of Montana students. A June 2014 agreement ended the investigation, with the county agreeing to training and special prosecutors for sexual assault cases. The university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns, according to the Montana Kaimin. The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. While Mr Krakauer's story focuses on Montana, the book's scope is more global. Missoula is described as 'a typical college town' and Mr Krakauer's website said that rape victims are 'deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken'. Mr Krakauer decided to write the book 'after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted,' according to USA Today. Sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country, with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations. Emma Sulkowicz at Columbia University attended the State of the Union with New York Senator Kristen Gillbrand after carrying a mattress around to classes in protest against her alleged attacker's continued presence on campus. Mr Krakauer, pictured speaking in 2009, is the best selling author of works such as Into Thin Air and Into the Wild. President Obama sent a pre-recorded message to the Grammys on Sunday urging artists to advocate against sexual and domestic violence. Ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the Department of Justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year. Mr Krakauer's book says that it 'cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape'. The writer's other works include Into the Wild, Under the Banner of Heaven and Into Thin Air, for which he was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Publisher Doubleday plans a first printing of 500,000 copies for the new book.

What is the title of this article: A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that 467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA. In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later. Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis. Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.","output":"Title: \\"The Role of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in Mortgage Lending: A Comprehensive Analysis of U.S. Lending Trends and the Impact on Subprime Loans from 1993-1998\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although Lucretius argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and Hero of Alexandria tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD, it was European scholars such as Roger Bacon, Blasius of Parma and Walter Burley in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues. Eventually following Stoic physics in this instance, scholars from the 14th century onward increasingly departed from the Aristotelian perspective in favor of a supernatural void beyond the confines of the cosmos itself, a conclusion widely acknowledged by the 17th century, which helped to segregate natural and theological concerns.

Article: Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system in order to take advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup.

Kim inherited some grassland, while Jane inherited a forest. They both took good care of their properties.  But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.  What is an answer for this question: Which person inherited a parcel where fewer fires occurred?

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: At the Academy Awards ceremony on March 27, 1957, Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her torrid, over-the-top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN ON THE WIND. The 1956 potboiler, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel , was a veritable three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism, greed, impotence and nymphomania. Malone's performance as Marylee Hadley , a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart, was representative of the movie as a whole. Mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the \\"lowest -common- denominator\\" melodrama, WRITTEN ON THE WIND is ultimately the work of one man, the incredibly gifted director Douglas Sirk, an émigré from pre -World War 2 Weimar Germany who left his European theater heritage behind to pursue a career in Hollywood. An extremely erudite man, Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as Universal Studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas, most notably with Ross Hunter's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE . Independent producer Albert Zugsmith offered Sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of Universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult , \\"sensational\\" product , hence the sultry WIND and its follow-up, 1957's TARNISHED ANGELS, both released under the Universal International banner. It's anyone's guess why Sirk didn't pursue loftier themes, but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities. WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered Sirk's epic soap opera ; indeed, it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous, perhaps more so. Robert Stack (not an actor typically known for over -emoting) nearly matches Malone in intensity with his offering of the weak- willed brother Kyle Hadley, a mere shadow of his patriarchal father. When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride ( a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall ) , Hadley goes off the deep end, escalating an already serious drinking problem with a \\"secret \\" gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb. Both brother and sister, as venal and unlikeable as they are, are presented as victims of their past, giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous ( and far more interesting than the 'good\\" side of the family, mainly Bacall and the impossibly handsome Rock Hudson , young Hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate, a surrogate son to the old man and Malone' s unattainable object of desire. ) Despite all the domestic co-dependency on display , it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed. With a real panache for pictorial composition and editing, director Sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened Technicolor cinematography imaginable : every single shot in this film is an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors, from the sight of a tank-like pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury Miami hotel , a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity. Action and dramatic scenes feature Sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles , shadowy lighting and cross-cut editing , shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious , drunken Malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase ; the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold. What you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind, gussied up in lurid Technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius.","output":"The sentiment of this review is mainly positive. The reviewer talks about the captivating performances, the amazing directing by Douglas Sirk, and the eye-catching cinematography. They mention that the movie is filled with intense emotions and dramatic scenes, making it very entertaining to watch.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - Halberstadt is a town in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, the capital of Harz district. Located north of the Harz mountain range, it is known for its old town centre that was severely damaged in World War II and rebuilt in the following decades.  - Israel Jacobson ( October 17 , 1768 , Halberstadt -- September 14 , 1828 , Berlin ) was a German - Jewish philanthropist and communal organiser . While he lacked a systematic religious approach , he is considered one of the heralds of Reform Judaism .  - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.  - In religion and theology, revelation is the revealing or disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity or other supernatural entity or entities.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. It is characterized by a lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as of basically non-binding nature, and great openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates. Its greatest center today is in North America.  - Abraham Geiger (24 May 181023 October 1874) was a German rabbi and scholar, considered the founding father of Reform Judaism. Emphasizing its constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to reformulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The Harz is the highest mountain range in Northern Germany and its rugged terrain extends across parts of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia. The name \\"Harz\\" derives from the Middle High German word \\"Hardt\\" or \\"Hart\\" (mountain forest), Latinized as \\"Hercynia\\". The legendary Brocken is the highest summit in the Harz with a height of above sea level. The Wurmberg is the highest peak located entirely within Lower Saxony.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.

Article: Peter Jackson, currently one of the world's most well-known directors and the unofficial face of the entire nation of New Zealand, was born on October 31, 1961 in Pukerua Bay, New Zealand. He liked to take photographs, so a family friend bought the young   Jackson a super 8mm camera. He has been a filmmaker even since. At age nine he even attempted to remake his favorite film, King Kong, using his own stop-motion effect. Unlike many of the filmmakers working today, Jackson never went to film school. Instead he created his own short films with the help of family and friends. He was turned down for a job at the National Film Unit, New Zealand's government agency that produces tourist films about the country. With that avenue closed, Jackson began working other jobs to support himself, while shooting shorts on the weekend. One of these weekend films, expanded from its original ten minutes length into a feature film. The project took four years to complete (1983-1987)and was called Bad Taste. After the success of Bad Taste, Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is obviously a huge  landmark in Jackson's career, not only did the films become some of the most commercially successful of all time,  _ His digital effects company, WETA Digital, became one of, if not the most respected effects company in the world; similarly, Jackson has also expressed an interest in returning to his roots and directing some lower-budget splatter films again.

Question: suppose \\"earth doesnt have a volcano\\" happens, how will it affect magma transforms into a volcano above the earth.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the hypothetical situation \\"earth doesn't have a volcano\\" were to happen, it would significantly affect the way magma transforms into a volcano above the earth, as well as influence the second effect mentioned: the gases coming to a head and pushing molten magma to the surface. In this scenario, without the presence of any volcanoes on Earth, the process of a volcanic eruption would be fundamentally altered. Volcanoes serve as natural conduits for magma to rise from the Earth's mantle to its crust and eventually erupt as lava. Without these conduits, the movement of magma to the surface would become restricted and other geological processes would need to take charge for the release of magma and pressure. Without volcanoes, one option is that the pressure of the gases and magma beneath the Earth's crust could build up until weak points or fissures in the crust are formed. In this case, magma could still be forced to the surface, although the result might not resemble the volcanic eruptions we are familiar with today. This could lead to less frequent and less predictable explosive events, as these weak points would not be as established as the volcanic conduits we have today. In terms of the second effect mentioned, where gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface, the perturbation caused by the absence of volcanoes would have a \\"less\\" effect. Without the presence of volcanoes or volcanic conduits, the gases would have a reduced ability to accumulate and be focused at specific points of release. This would complicate and diminish the pressure-driven process that forces magma to the surface.  Gases would still be produced within the mantle, but without any specific release points, the distribution of gases would be more widespread beneath the Earth's crust. This would lead to a reduction in localized pressure, thus having a less apparent effect on the pushing magma to the surface. To summarize, a situation where the Earth doesn't have any volcanoes would have a significant impact on the process of magma transforming into a volcano and the effect of gas pressure forcing magma to the surface. The absence of volcanoes would lead to less ability for gases to accumulate and push molten magma to the surface, disrupting the natural volcanic eruption process and forcing alternative geological processes to take place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - thinking - sleeping - use soap - irritation - cleaning dirt off  Explain why a human would choose \\"thinking\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human might choose \\"thinking\\" as the answer to the question because when people are washing their hands for a long time, they often engage in some form of mental activity or contemplation. This happens because the task of hand washing is a repetitive activity that does not require much focus or concentration, thereby providing an opportunity for the mind to wander or process thoughts and ideas. Additionally, spending a considerable amount of time washing hands could be a moment for self-reflection or problem-solving, as it can serve as a brief break from other daily tasks and chores.

Q:Background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  Paragraph: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life?

Frying the paneer cubes is the most logical next step to proceed with the Kashmiri style paneer curry recipe. Frying will help provide a crispy and firm texture to the paneer, which is essential for the preparation of a delicious and flavorful curry. To continue with the recipe, follow the steps below: 1. Heat a sufficient amount of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. 2. Once the oil is hot enough, gently add the paneer cubes into the pan and make sure they are well separated. 3. Fry until the paneer cubes turn golden brown on all sides. Be careful not to over-fry, as this may make the paneer chewy. 4. Once the paneer cubes are fried, remove them from the pan and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil. Now that you have prepared the paneer, the next steps to make the Kashmiri style paneer curry are: 5. In a separate pan, heat some oil and add whole spices such as cloves, green cardamom, and cinnamon. Cook for a minute to release the flavors of the spices. 6. Add finely chopped onions to the pan and fry until they turn golden brown. 7. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute. 8. At this point, add the main Kashmiri red chili powder, which offers the curry its distinct red color and is less spicy compared to other varieties. Mix well. 9. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and the oil starts separating from the mixture. 10. Pour in some water to create the desired consistency for the curry. Bring the mixture to a boil and then lower the heat to simmer.  11. Once the curry starts to thicken, add salt, garam masala, and fennel powder for additional flavor and aroma. 12. Finally, add the fried paneer cubes to the curry and let them cook for a few more minutes to absorb the flavors of the spices. 13. Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Consider adding a pinch of sugar to balance the flavors. 14. Garnish the curry with fresh cilantro/coriander leaves and serve hot with rice or roti.

Article: The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at the University of Virginia said Monday that it is moving forward with a possible lawsuit against Rolling Stone magazine in the wake of the now-retracted \\"Rape on Campus\\" article.      \\"After 130 days of living under a cloud of suspicion as a result of reckless reporting by Rolling Stone magazine, today the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against the magazine,\\" the fraternity said in a statement.      The fraternity hasn't made a formal decision yet on when to file a suit, a spokesman said.      Rolling Stone declined to comment on the frat's statement.      Its announcement came one day after the magazine published a damning external review of the editorial processes that resulted in the article's publication.      The Rolling Stone article had alleged that a freshman student named Jackie had been gang raped during a Phi Kappa Psi frat party in September 2012.      But soon after the article was printed last November, contradictions and discrepancies in Jackie's account emerged. The frat came out and denied that a party even took place on the night of the alleged attack.      In December, the magazine apologized for the article and asked the Columbia University Journalism school to review what went wrong.      Related: Can UVA fraternity actually sue Rolling Stone?      One of Columbia's main conclusions was that the writer of the article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and her editors should have been much more forthcoming in her contacts with Phi Kappa Psi.      If Rolling Stone \\"had given the fraternity a chance to review the allegations in detail, the factual discrepancies the fraternity would likely have reported might have led Erdely and her editors to try to verify Jackie's account more thoroughly,\\" the review said.      According to the review, \\"none of the editors ever discussed with Erdely\\" whether frat officials had been given enough detail about the charges. She \\"never raised the subject with her editors.\\"      In a statement on Monday, Stephen Scipione, the president of the Phi Kappa Psi chapter, said \\"this type of reporting serves as a sad example of a serious decline of journalistic standards.\\"      \\"A lot of people threaten defamation and don't follow through with a lawsuit,\\" HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said on CNN on Monday afternoon. \\"In this case, it's hard to argue that there were not tangible, recognizable reputational injuries.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"In what sectors could only men serve?\\"  Context: \\"Women in the Middle Ages were officially required to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much control over their own lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry near the house. They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of the Middle Ages, sectors where only men could serve primarily included military and government affairs, as well as the priesthood within the Church. Women were generally restricted from these roles due to societal norms and expectations of their responsibilities being more focused on household and domestic tasks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.  - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States.  - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving.  - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE. FE colleges are also a large provider of apprenticeships, where most of the training takes place in the apprentices' workplace with some day release into college.  - National Higher Education Fund Corporation ( Malay : Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional ) , abbreviated PTPTN is an authority responsible for giving study loans to students pursuing tertiary education in Malaysia . This agency is under Ministry of Education .

Russian forces are monitoring the ceasefire along a key access road in northern Syria that leads to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, reports say. Some 250,000 civilians are trapped there. UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said if the truce held, aid deliveries \\"should be taking place very, very soon\\". He said the UN was waiting for the Syrian government to authorise deliveries and he hoped the people of Syria could look forward to \\"no bombs and more trucks\\". Since the truce came into effect at sunset on Monday, accusations have been made against both rebels and government forces for sporadically violating it. But there have been no reports of civilian deaths so far. The Russian military claims US-backed groups have violated the ceasefire more than 20 times. including killing two government troops on the Castello road, which leads to rebel-held Aleppo. The Russian foreign ministry called on the US \\"to deal with their clients\\". Russia has deployed reconnaissance equipment in Aleppo to detect and suppress ceasefire violations. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said pro-government forces had shelled two villages near Aleppo and an area near Damascus. It earlier said it had seen reports of aerial bombardment of some villages in Hama province. The Syrian government says it will not allow aid, particularly \\"from the Turkish regime\\", to be delivered to Aleppo without prior co-ordination with it and the UN, state media report. The UN says its trucks will not move until peace is assured. \\"We need to enter an environment where we are not in mortal danger,\\" Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said. The head of rebel-held Aleppo's city council told Reuters news agency that residents there were in desperate need of fuel, flour, wheat, baby milk and medicines. US Secretary of State John Kerry called on Friday for the Castello road to be demilitarised and said the US would work with Russia to free the route for aid convoys to reach Aleppo. The Syrian army has said the truce will be applied throughout Syria for seven days, but that it reserves the right to respond decisively to any violation by armed groups. A number of rebel factions have given a guarded welcome to the deal but expressed reservations about its implementation. A statement from 21 opposition factions including the Free Syrian Army said they were \\"fully aware of the trap being set to make us sink in a quagmire of concessions or lead us to infighting that divides our ranks and disunites us\\". They said they opposed the targeting of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (known until recently as the Nusra Front) which recently split from al-Qaeda \\"as this would weaken the military power of the revolution and strengthen the Assad regime and its allies\\". If the truce holds for seven days, a key part of the deal is that the US and Russia will carry out co-ordinated air strikes on militant groups -  including so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The deal, described by Mr Kerry as the \\"last chance to save a united Syria\\", was struck on Friday in Geneva after months of talks between Russia and the US. It requires both sides to allow unhindered access for humanitarian aid. The number of deaths recorded since the beginning of the conflict in March 2011 has now risen past 300,000, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. However, it said it estimated the full death toll to be about 430,000. More than 4.8 million have fled abroad, and an estimated 6.5 million others have been displaced within the country, the UN says. Jihadist groups like so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham face the joint might of the Russian and US air forces Moderate rebels and civilians in the areas they hold will no longer face the threat of indiscriminate air strikes such as barrel-bombing although the Syrian air force will not be grounded completely; aid deliveries will be allowed to areas currently under siege President Assad will be in a stronger position as the US and Russia engage two of his most effective military opponents while moderate rebels observe the truce with his forces February 2012: Syrian government \\"categorically rejects\\" an Arab League plan calling for a joint Arab-UN peacekeeping mission June 2012/January 2014/January 2016: Three failed UN-sponsored peace conferences in Geneva September 2013: Kerry and Lavrov negotiate a deal to strip the Syrian government of its chemical weapons in return for the US backing away from air strikes.

News.      But that didn't stop Tila Tequila from trying to make the story about her.      \\"I don't want to talk about the funeral,\\" Tequila tells us. \\"I wasn't allowed to go and I am so upset. I can't sleep and I am on suicide watch.\\"      While Tequila may be the only one on suicide watch, she wasn't the only one not invited to the service, which is shaping up to be a private affair possibly taking place tomorrow. Several of the heiress's Hollywood pals, including Paris Hilton and former gal-pal Courtenay Semel, didn't make the guest list.      Tequila, nominally Johnson's fiancée, also addressed the theory brought up on Johnson's 911 call that the socialite may have taken her own life.      \\"It was an accident, for sure,\\" Tequila said. \\"She was so happy and wasn't ready to die.\\"      Although autopsy results are still weeks away, Tequila believes Johnson's death last Monday was related to diabetes.      \\"She gave me a book and told me what to do if something like that happened to her in the middle of the night,\\" Tequila said. \\"She knew if she wasn't treated then she could die.\\"      Tequila also insisted, \\"Casey would want me to take care of [Johnson's daughter] Ava.\\" And she is still stewing about the visit paid by Nicky Hilton and Bijou Phillips earlier this week to collect Johnson's two dogs, a poodle named Zoe and a Yorkie named Elvis, along with various belongings.      \\"They all lied to me,\\" Tequila said. \\"I just want the dogs back and make sure they are OK…I want it all back.\\"      At the time, Tequila said she feared Hilton and Phillips were going to put the dogs to sleep.

But then, the anti-heroine resurfaced Sunday with 68 tweets and new blog posts. The tweets told the sad story of why Tila is incapable of staying off Twitter in her time of grief:      Then, our tragic figure took to her official blog on Joe Francis-sponsored soft-core porn purveyor Tila's Hot Spot Dating and penned a missive entitled \\"TILA TEQUILA'S COMPELLING & SAD LIFE STORY!\\" Like Tila's Twitter, her blog is illegible and kind of frightening to experience firsthand, so here is an abbreviated guide and translation:      Tila: Well last night I was on Twitter and I was just tweeting about random things and somehow one Tweet into the next it lead me into writing a mini auto-biography through 7 hours of Tweeting!!!!!!! [...] Everyone who read it was moved to tears and today a lot of people kept asking me where they could find that story.

That she clawed her way into Hollywood and onto MTV is actually pretty impressive, and accounts for my weird and deeply irrational soft spot for Tila, even as she proves time and again that she deserves very little sympathy. I guess she'll make for a fascinating profile subject some day (in that \\"fascination with the abomination\\" way) but not until she takes it down a notch or twenty-seven.

Tila had another cause to celebrate at the end of her two-day Twitter hiatus: Larry King booked her for Tuesday. But then her arch nemeses, Casey Johnson's loved ones, protested and Larry seems to have de-booked her, opting for interviews on the White House gatecrashers instead. Tila says it's a conspiracy:      * This is horrifying in many ways, not least of which being that there is apparently nobody to respond to Tila's cry for help, which reminds me of a certain other recent Hollywood flameout. Over Christmas, Tila says she made amends with her estranged sister, and there's that brother she's a surrogate for. What happened to them?      ** Is it possible that Tila is perfectly sane, and this is just how her mind works, and there is no cause for alarm? Or is something very bad about to happen?

The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler.

At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued  for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.\\" Question: What did Mumbet learn from discussions about the new consititution? Answer: Choose from: (A).

Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season to the Steelers, the Vikings flew to Lambeau Field for the highly anticipated Week 8 divisional rematch with the Green Bay Packers, as quarterback Brett Favre made his return to his former team. In the first quarter, the Packers scored the game's first points as kicker Mason Crosby made a 37-yard field goal following a miscue by Vikings center John Sullivan (Favre audibled for another play but Sullivan snapped the ball before Favre completed his audible). Minnesota responded with a 1-yard touchdown from running back Adrian Peterson. In the second quarter, the Vikings added onto their lead as Favre completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell (another former Packer) nailing a 41-yard field goal. Minnesota picked up where they left off in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 51-yard touchdown pass, yet Green Bay started to rally as Crosby booted a 26-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Aaron Rodgers finding tight end Spencer Havner on a 16-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings answered in the fourth quarter with Favre connecting with tight end/fullback Jeff Dugan on a 2-yard touchdown pass. The Packers tried to come back as Rodgers completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Minnesota pulled away with Favre finding wide receiver Bernard Berrian on a 16-yard touchdown pass. With their first season-sweep of the Packers in four years, the Vikings went into their bye week at 7-1, and took a commanding two and a half game lead in the NFC North over the second-place Packers. Favre threw at least 4 touchdowns for the 21st time in his career, matching the NFL record held by Dan Marino. This also marks Vikings head coach Brad Childress' first win at Green Bay (he is 3-5 overall against the Packers) and the Vikings' first sweep of the Packers since 2005.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of smoking fewer cigarettes would have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body. When you smoke cigarettes, they contain harmful chemicals and toxins, including carbon monoxide, which compete with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that is available to be transported around the body. If a person smokes fewer cigarettes, the level of carbon monoxide and other harmful chemicals in their bloodstream would be reduced. This would allow for more oxygen to bind to hemoglobin, thus increasing the amount of oxygen being delivered to the body's cells. As a result, the body's organs and tissues would function more efficiently and effectively, leading to improved overall health and well-being. In conclusion, smoking less would have a positive effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body, as it would lead to a decrease in harmful chemicals that compete with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this was right next to my work and I wanted to get it over with and try something new.  **BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER**  I left this place feeling disappointed and grossed out.   1)They reuse their nail filers and buffers.   2) The guy did a really uneven coat (some areas had the color and the other areas you saw my nail) so I told him I didn't like it. He removed it with the mechanical buffer thing. I didn't realize it until I got home and felt a stinging when I was cutting onions but he ended up buffing off my skin too! It wasn't just one finger too!  3) A client came in and was waiting for my manicurist. While I was picking a new color (he blamed it on the polish for the uneven job) I hear him telling the client that he was behind because I didn't like what he did. Which made me feel rushed and annoyed.   4) After I picked my color, he rushed through my gel manicure, put my hand under the UV light and rolled his chair over to the client that was waiting. He took off her gel manicure then came back to me to finish off my manicure.   5) He used his fingernail to remove the polish at the edge of the nail by my skin - f'ing gross  6) I watched him when he went to the other client and he used the same supplies he used on me on her.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"What aside from the sharpness of vision can aid in hunting prey?\\"  Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Aside from the sharpness of vision, other factors that can aid in hunting prey include the ability to detect ultraviolet light, the use of the nictitating membrane for eye lubrication and maintaining clear vision, wide visual fields or binocular vision for depth estimation, and adaptations in the avian ear for improved hearing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Nice Look, Nice Humidity, Yet Problems Review: We purchased this humidifier at WalMart when they were clearanced last year and got them out of the attic for this winter. First of all I don't understand how it can be called a \\"15 gallon\\" humidifier when it really only holds 4 gallons - can anyone explain this? Also, we have also had problems with knowing when to refill it until the humidifier starts making a funny noise (and this surely isn't good on the machine to constantly let it run out of water). Also, we have had a funny substance running out of the machine almost from the beginning of use, and today while wiping up the \\"junk\\" I noticed that it is green now. ???? Anyway - the reason I rated it a '2' is because it is nice looking and does run 'fairly' quietly when it is full of water. Overall, our family has been very disappointed in this humidifier. Answer: The answer is:","output":"There is a negative tone to this product review.  The reviewer has shared several issues they have faced with the product, starting with the confusion regarding the capacity of the humidifier. They mention calling it a \\"15-gallon\\" humidifier when it only holds 4 gallons, which indicates that they feel misled by the labeling or description of the product.  Another problem the reviewer has faced is not knowing when to refill the humidifier, which leads to it running out of water and making a strange noise. This not only causes them inconvenience but also raises concerns over the lifespan of the machine if it is being continuously operated without water. The reviewer also brings up a hygiene concern, with the humidifier emitting a strange, green substance from the beginning of its usage. This is concerning for them, as it likely questions the safety and cleanliness of the product. The reviewer does mention two positive aspects of the product, which are its nice appearance and the relatively quiet operation when full of water. However, these positives are outweighed by the multiple negative points discussed. In conclusion, the overall tone of the review is negative, as the reviewer expresses disappointment with the product and outlines several problems they encountered while using it. The rating of '2' also highlights their dissatisfaction with the humidifier's performance."},{"instruction":"Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: James Hart (Timothy Bottoms) starts his first year at Harvard Law School in a very bad way.

When Kingsfield immediately delves into the material using the Socratic method and asks Hart the first question, he is totally unprepared and feels so utterly humiliated that, after class, he throws up in the bathroom.

Hart returns to her house soon after and watches her from the sidewalk before knocking on the door and asking her on a date, after which they begin a relationship. Their relationship is complex; she resents the time he devotes to his studies, while he expects her to provide him with a great deal of attention and wants their relationship to have a firm commitment.

He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above.

Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother, Teddy, once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases, but after Teddy was killed by a toon, Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again. One day, R.K. Maroon, head of Maroon Cartoon Studios, is concerned about the recent poor acting performances of one of his biggest stars, Roger Rabbit. Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadgets inventor, Marvin Acme, owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown. After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink &amp; Paint Club, Valiant secretly takes photographs of her and Acme playing patty-cake in her dressing room, which he shows to Roger. Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica, but a drunken Roger refuses and flees. The next morning, Acme is discovered dead at his factory with a safe dropped on his head, and evidence points to Roger being responsible. While investigating, Valiant meets Judge Doom, Toontown's Superior Court judge, who has created a substance capable of killing a toon: a toxic chemical known as \\"The Dip\\".

At our bakeries in Belgium, for example, we have introduced regular analyses to ensure our flour has the right baking properties. Waste reduction is a crucial element for sustainable living and reducing our environmental footprint. By focusing on production, product, and consumer levels, a comprehensive approach to waste management can be implemented, with benefits spanning across the entire supply chain. At the production level, waste reduction can be achieved through optimizing manufacturing operations, focusing on resource efficiency, and reducing the amount of waste generated during the manufacturing process. This may include using advanced technology to monitor production and minimize resource consumption, eliminating unnecessary processes, and ensuring that equipment runs at optimal efficiency. Implementing lean manufacturing principles and embracing a circular economy approach can also contribute to waste reduction. In terms of the product, businesses can actively work towards reducing waste by designing their products to have a longer lifespan, be more easily repairable, and use fewer materials, resulting in a lower overall environmental impact. By choosing environmentally friendly materials, using less packaging, and implementing eco-design principles, companies can develop products that contribute to waste reduction efforts and promote a more sustainable lifestyle for consumers. Lastly, at the consumer level, waste reduction can be promoted through awareness campaigns, education, and incentives to encourage consumers to make more sustainable choices. Consumers can be educated on proper recycling practices, reducing food waste, embracing minimalism, and making conscious efforts to purchase and use products that have less environmental impact. By offering incentives and fostering a culture of sustainability, businesses can help consumers make choices that contribute to the overall goal of waste reduction. One excellent example of waste reduction efforts at a local level is demonstrated by bakeries in Belgium. By conducting regular analyses of their flour, these bakeries ensure that it has the appropriate baking properties, thus minimizing any potential waste that could be generated due to unfavorable baking results. This practice not only contributes to waste reduction but also maintains a high level of quality and consistency in the products they offer. In conclusion, waste reduction efforts that focus on production, product, and consumer levels can significantly contribute to a more sustainable future. By implementing best practices at every stage, businesses can play an essential role in reducing waste, promoting environmental awareness, and ensuring that consumers have access to eco-friendly products and information needed to make environmentally conscious choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  The courtesans  for the following movie plot:  In four elegant brothels, called \\"Flower Houses\\", in fin-de-siÃ¨cle 19th-century Shanghai (Qing dynasty), several affairs are described. Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal.

Where can a finger be warm? - glove - ring - cake batter to taste add weight to scale - nose - hand  The best answer is","output":"While all the mentioned options hold some truth, the most accurate and appropriate answer among them is using a glove to keep a finger warm. Gloves are specifically designed to provide warmth, insulation, and protection to fingers and hands during cold weather or when handling cold objects. Moreover, gloves come in various materials such as wool, leather, and synthetics, which offer varying degrees of warmth, comfort, and versatility. Now, let us discuss the other options and ascertain why gloves are superior for warmth. 1. Ring: Although a ring adorns fingers and may occupy a small surface area of the finger, it does not help in maintaining the warmth of the entire finger. A ring can be made from different materials, such as gold, silver, or platinum, which may have conductive properties, but they do not offer substantial insulation. Therefore, a ring cannot compete with gloves when it comes to providing warmth. 2. Cake batter: Certainly, cake batter can be warm due to the ingredients, such as eggs and milk, which are often incorporated at room temperature. When dipping a finger into cake batter, it may feel warm momentarily, but this is not a suitable solution for keeping fingers comfortable, especially in cold conditions. Additionally, the use of cake batter is limited to occasions when baking, and its warming property is not persistent. 3. Weight on a scale: This option is slightly unclear in terms of keeping a finger warm. Perhaps by adding a weight to a scale and holding the finger firmly on the weighing platform could give temporary warmth through the contact. However, using a weight on a scale is not a practical way to maintain warmth and protect fingers from the cold. 4. Nose: The human body emanates heat, and therefore, touching one's nose with a finger can certainly feel warm. Nonetheless, placing a finger on or in the nose continuously in order to keep it warm is impractical and can be considered unhygienic. 5. Hand: As mentioned earlier, the human body produces heat, so clasping fingers within the palm of the same or another person's hand can give a certain degree of warmth to the finger. However, this method lacks the insulation and long-lasting warmth that gloves provide. Furthermore, holding fingers in hand may not be feasible when one needs to use their hands for other tasks. In conclusion, while all the above-listed options involve some contact with warmth, gloves are undeniably the most effective and practical choice for keeping fingers warm. Gloves offer insulation, protection, and retain heat for an extended period, making them an ideal solution in comparison to options such as rings, cake batter, weights on scales, noses, or hands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Within the past 100 years, the amount of land used for agriculture has almost doubled. Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled. Many wetlands have also been lost to agriculture. The U.S. has lost almost all the natural tall-grass prairies. Thee areas of tall thick grass have virtually disappeared. These areas of land had thick fertile soil. Their grasses had very deep root systems. These deep and thick roots reduced the amount of soil erosion. They also were home to many plants and animals. Prairies were wonderful places.

Contractor behind HealthCare.gov to testify extra testing could not have saved site A top executive with CGI Federal, one of the contractors paid millions to create the ObamaCare website, says “no amount of testing” could have prevented the site’s problem-plagued start. Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell’s remarks are part of prepared testimony she will give before a Republican-led House hearing Thursday on the insurance-marketplace site. They also appear to challenge new claims by the administration that a lack of adequate testing was part of the problem. The House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing is the first since the site’s disastrous Oct. 1 launch -- marked by crashes, slow response times and its inability to let customers make purchases. In the prepared testimony, Campbell argues that with a system “this complex with so many concurrent users, it is not unusual to discover problems that need to be addressed once the software goes into a live production environment.” “No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,” she adds, according to the prepared testimony. Campbell said issues with HealthCare.gov have continued to improve over the past two weeks, but additional challenges are occurring as more users get past the registration screen and buy insurance -- including “data assurance issues.” She said such problems can be fixed through “tuning, optimization and application improvements.” The testimony comes as the Obama administration offered new details and explanations on Wednesday. The administration said the system didn't get enough testing, especially at a high user volume. It blamed a compressed time frame for meeting the Oct. 1 deadline to open the insurance markets. Basic \\"alpha and user testing\\" are now completed, but that's supposed to happen before a launch, not after. The Health and Human Services explanation identified some bugs that have gotten little outside attention. For example, technical problems have surfaced that are making it hard for people to complete the application and plan-shopping functions. That's a big concern because those stages are further along in the signup process than the initial registration, where many consumers have been getting tripped up. The problems are being analyzed and fixes are planned, the department said. The explanation, posted online in a department blog and accompanying graphic, identified other broad areas of problems and outlined fixes underway but in most cases incomplete: -- Unexpectedly high consumer interest that overwhelmed the system in its initial days. Equipment has been added to handle the load and system design has been improved. More fixes are in progress. -- Lack of a way for consumers to browse their health plan options without first having to set up a user account. A partial fix is in place. -- Incorrect or duplicate information in enrollments is being delivered to insurance companies. Some software fixes that should help address the issue have been completed, others are underway. -- Difficulties for consumers trying to create user accounts, including drop-down menus that didn't work. Design changes and software fixes should address the situation. On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will line up contractors, including CGI Federal, the lead developer of the website, and QSSI, which designed a back-room operation known as the federal data services hub. The hub is integral to verifying applicants' personal information and income details, and the administration says it is working as designed. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Title: Deception Movie plot: Christine Radcliffe (Bette Davis) runs up the stairs of a college concert hall in the rain. The hall is filled with enraptured students, and her eyes fill with tears as she recognizes the cellist on stage: Karel Novak (Paul Henreid) who spent the war trapped in neutral Sweden. After the performance, Novak is mobbed by well-wishers, and a student reporter questions him about his favorite composers. Novak lists some famous ones, then adds, \\"And, of course, Hollenius.\\" Novak returns to his dressing room, Christine enters and their eyes meet in his mirror. The couple embraces while Christine cries, \\"I thought you were dead. I saw them kill you.\\" Karel and Christine return to her apartment. Karel becomes suspicious of the rare artwork on display and the fur coat hanging in the closet. Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment. They marry, but the composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains) makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception. It is evident he is jealous, and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent. Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto, which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere. It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra, Bertram Gribble (John Abbott), is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius. Suspecting the sabotage of her husband's career, she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not co-operating. A friction develops between Novak and Hollenius, and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novak's temperamental behavior. On the evening of the premiere, Christine visits Hollenius, who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair. Distraught, Christine shoots him dead. Another conductor, Neilsen, takes the place of the absent Hollenius, and the performance is a great success. While well-wishers wait, Christine confesses everything to her husband, and they leave the concert hall...","output":"Can't answer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it When did researchers discover eating a lot of fruit can reduce the risk of an aortic aneurysm? - After conducting a 13-year study. - After developing diabetes. - After going on a low crab diet. - not enough information Answer:","output":"After conducting a 13-year study."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require  large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share.  But I can use this background: A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels.  What is an answer for this question: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","output":"Firm B's average total cost would decline. This is because Firm B managed to increase its market share, allowing it to spread its high fixed costs over a larger number of customers.

In contrast, Firm C failed to increase its market share, so it could not benefit from the economies of scale to the same extent as Firm B."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas... The answer is:","output":"Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge, and Yellow toadflax are non-native plant species considered noxious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Given the question: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

Solve 0 = 233994*k - 234048*k + 3510 for k.","output":"To solve the given equation, 0 = 233994*k - 234048*k + 3510, for k, we need to simplify and isolate the variable k. Let's follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms The equation has two terms containing the variable k: 233994*k and -234048*k. We start by combining these terms. 0 = (233994 - 234048) * k + 3510 Note that 233994 - 234048 = -54. Now, we can simplify the equation as: 0 = -54 * k + 3510 Step 2: Isolate the variable k We want the variable k by itself, so we will work on isolating it. To do that, we need to reverse the operations applied to k in order. Currently, k is being multiplied by -54 and then added to 3510. We can reverse this by first subtracting 3510 from both sides and then dividing by -54. Subtract 3510 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 3510 = -54 * k + 3510 - 3510 -3510 = -54 * k Now, divide both sides of the equation by -54: (-3510) / (-54) = (-54 * k) / (-54) 65 = k Step 3: Check the solution We can always verify our solution by substituting the value of k back into the original equation and verifying that both sides balance: 0 = 233994 * k - 234048 * k + 3510 0 = 233994 * 65 - 234048 * 65 + 3510 Now perform the calculations: 0 = 15209610 - 15209640 + 3510 0 = -30 + 3510 0 = 0 As both sides are equal, our solution is correct.

Summarize: The Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes galleon sank off Portugal's coast near the straits of Gibraltar in 1804 with more than 500,000 silver coins. Spain won a five-year legal dispute to claim ownership for the treasures found by a US firm. Only a small portion of the treasure, estimated to be worth 500m (Â£310m; 385m euros) has been displayed. A block of encrusted silver coins stuck together after centuries under water, two gold tobacco boxes and a bronze pulley were among some of the items shown. After it has been fully catalogued - a process that began when the treasure arrived from Florida in February - the silver treasure will be put on display in Spain's museum of underwater archaeology in Cartagena. So far, experts have counted 574,553 silver coins and 212 gold coins, as well as other items. The metals were mined and the coins minted in the Andes, from places that are now in Bolivia, Chile and Peru. Spanish officials say that they never intend to sell the treasure. \\"It's invaluable,\\" Elisa de Cabo, the culture ministry's deputy director of national heritage, said according to the Associated Press. \\"How would you put a price on the Mona Lisa?\\" Obtaining the ship's haul was the culmination of a long legal fight. Ms de Cabo said Spanish authorities are still trying to convince a US judge that the American company that found the wreck,  Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration, should also pay Spain's legal costs.

Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: Is Papa a young boy? Movie title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\". One day, Mickey picks up Heather in his cab and goes up to her apartment to retrieve a television that belonged to him... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"She's the One,\\" the character referred to as \\"Papa\\" is not a young boy. Instead, \\"Papa\\" is an older man with whom Heather (Cameron Diaz) has a sexual relationship. Heather's involvement with \\"Papa\\" becomes a point of contention in her relationship with Francis (Mike McGlone), who is having an affair with her while being married to Renee (Jennifer Aniston). The film revolves around the complicated love lives of the two Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey and Francis, their experiences with betrayal, and the consequences of their actions on themselves and the people around them. The relationships involving Heather, Francis, Renee, and \\"Papa\\" play a significant role in the development of the story and demonstrate the complexities and challenges that people often face in their romantic relationships.

Is \\"The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Which river is the eastern edge of the South Bronx?\\"","output":"No, the statement \\"The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.\\" is not a good answer to the question \\"Which river is the eastern edge of the South Bronx?\\" A good answer should provide the name of the river that serves as the eastern boundary of the South Bronx while addressing the geographical context. A better, detailed and long answer to the question would be: The South Bronx, a region located in the southeastern part of the Bronx borough in New York City, is geographically defined by its natural borders consisting of rivers and parks. The eastern edge of the South Bronx is formed by the Bronx River, a 23-mile long freshwater river that flows through the borough. This river originates in Westchester County and enters the Bronx near the New York Botanical Garden, which is located in the northern part of the Bronx. It then meanders through the South Bronx, passing parks, and residential neighborhoods before ultimately emptying into the East River. Historically, the Bronx River played a significant role in the industrial and urban development of the area. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the river was used for transportation and as a source of power, propelling the growth of the various manufacturing industries that flourished in the region. Unfortunately, the rapid urbanization and industrial activities led to pollution and degradation of the river, which consequently affected the surrounding neighborhoods. The South Bronx has faced numerous economic and social challenges, including high poverty rates and crime. However, recent revitalization efforts have been made to improve the conditions in the area. These initiatives include investments in affordable housing, new businesses, and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, projects like the Bronx River Greenway and the Bronx River Alliance have focused on restoring and protecting the river, transforming it into a recreational and natural asset for the community. So, in conclusion, the river that forms the eastern edge of the South Bronx is the Bronx River, which not only serves as a geographical marker for the area but also as a representation of the neighborhood's past and potential future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  I am facing a new situation today: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had less occurrences of divers drowning? The answer is:","output":"Big Lake. Step 1: Understand the background information The background article explains that thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature, can occur in lakes when there are specific conditions. For example, in lakes where cold fresh water enters a warmer sea, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, causing the temperature to rise as the diver descends. In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water, which can lead to convection currents. Step 2: Analyze the new situation In the new situation, Ryan explored two lakes: Big Lake and Arrow Lake. Arrow Lake had a river flowing into it, which is a condition that can cause a thermocline with a temperature increase as the diver descends. Big Lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity, which can lead to convection currents. Many divers have drowned in Arrow Lake due to temperature shock. Step 3: Apply background knowledge to the new situation From the background information, we know that a thermocline can cause sudden temperature changes in a lake. In Arrow Lake, the river flowing into it likely caused a thermocline, resulting in a temperature increase as divers descended. This temperature shock likely contributed to the frequent drowning incidents. On the other hand, Big Lake has underwater geothermal activity, which leads to convection currents. While there might be temperature differences between the surface and deeper parts of the lake, convection currents tend to distribute the temperature more evenly, reducing the likelihood of sudden temperature changes that could cause temperature shock for divers. Step 4: Answer the question Based on the information provided and our understanding of thermoclines, Big Lake is the lake with fewer occurrences of divers drowning because it has a lower likelihood of sharp temperature changes due to convection currents caused by geothermal activity. On the contrary, Arrow Lake has a thermocline caused by the river flowing into it, which resulted in temperature shock and drowning incidents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The deliciousness of the dessert is not primarily dependent on the serving temperature, so individuals can prefer either option, and this versatility appeals to a wide range of taste preferences. Freshly baked, the pudding gives off a rich aroma of butter and almonds, and when served warm, it provides an indulgent and comforting experience. On the other hand, when served cold, the pudding has a firmer texture and allows the different elements, like the pastry and almond filling, to meld together harmoniously. 2. Ways to Serve: Bakewell Pudding can be served in different ways to suit tastes and occasions. According to the data, it can be presented either warm or cold, which gives consumers the flexibility to decide how they want to enjoy it. Here are some suggestions for serving Bakewell Pudding: A. Warm: - Fresh out of the oven: For those who love to indulge in freshly baked treats, Bakewell Pudding can be enjoyed straight from the oven. This allows for the warmth and aroma of the pastry to create a cozy, inviting experience. - With a scoop of ice cream: Pairing warm Bakewell Pudding with a scoop of ice cream creates a delightful contrast in temperatures and adds richness to the overall dessert. A popular choice for ice cream flavors would be vanilla, but you can also try other flavors, such as caramel or even berry-flavored ice creams to complement the jam layer. B. Cold: - As a standalone treat: Bakewell Pudding is delicious all on its own, even when enjoyed cold. The pastry, jam, and filling each offer distinct flavors and textures to create a satisfying and moreish dessert. - With a side of whipped cream or custard: To enhance the creamy texture and add a touch of indulgence, cold Bakewell Pudding can be served with a side of whipped cream or custard. This addition further highlights the depth of flavors in the pudding while providing a smooth and velvety consistency. In summary, the data informs us that Bakewell Pudding is a versatile dessert that can be enjoyed at different temperatures and served in various ways. Regardless of whether it is warm or cold, this classic English dessert remains a delightful and delicious experience for all to relish."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],j={key:0},F={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
