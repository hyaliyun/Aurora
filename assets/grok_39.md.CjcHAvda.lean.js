First Method: Using the Law of Sines 1. We start by expressing m and n in terms of the circumradius R and angles beta_1 and beta_2: [ m = 2R sin beta_1 quad text{and} quad n = 2R sin beta_2 ] 2. Next, we need to express sin beta_2 in terms of beta_1. From the given, we know that: [ beta_2 = 60^circ - beta_1 ] 3. Using the angle subtraction formula for sine, we can write: [ sin(60^circ - beta_1) = sin 60^circ cos beta_1 - cos 60^circ sin beta_1 ] 4. Plugging in the known values for sin 60^circ and cos 60^circ, we get: [ sin(60^circ - beta_1) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta_1 - frac{1}{2} sin beta_1 ] 5. Now substituting this back into the expressions for m and n, we have: [ m + n = 2R sin beta_1 + 2R sin(60^circ - beta_1) ] 6. Substituting the expression for sin(60^circ - beta_1): [ m + n = 2R sin beta_1 + 2R left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta_1 - frac{1}{2} sin beta_1right) ] 7. Simplifying, we get: [ m + n = 2R left(sin beta_1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta_1 - frac{1}{2} sin beta_1right) ] [ m + n = 2R left(frac{1}{2} sin beta_1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta_1right) ] 8. Recognizing that frac{1}{2} sin beta_1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos beta_1 = sin(beta_1 + frac{pi}{3}), we have: [ m + n = 2R sin left(beta_1 + frac{pi}{3}right) ] 9. Knowing that beta_1 + frac{pi}{3} = angle BCM and using the law of sines in triangle BMC, we get: [ m + n = BM = b ] Thus, the sum of m and n is indeed b. Second Method: Using the Law of Cosines 1. We start by noting that angle AMB = angle CMB = 60^circ since M lies on arc AC of the circumscribed circle. 2. Applying the law of cosines in triangles triangle AMB and triangle CMB, we get: [ AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 - 2 cdot AM cdot BM cdot cos(60^circ) = m^2 + b^2 - m cdot b ] [ AB^2 = CM^2 + BM^2 - 2 cdot CM cdot BM cdot cos(60^circ) = n^2 + b^2 - n cdot b ] 3. Equating the two expressions for (AB^2), we get: [ m^2 + b^2 - m cdot b = n^2 + b^2 - n cdot b ] 4. Simplifying, we cancel (b^2) and rearrange the terms: [ m^2 - n^2 = m cdot b - n cdot b ] 5. Factoring the left-hand side as a difference of squares, we get: [ (m - n)(m + n) = b(m - n) ] 6. Assuming m neq n, we can divide both sides by (m - n): [ m + n = b ] 7. If m = n, implying point M is the midpoint of arc AC, then BM is the diameter of the circle. Hence angle BAM = 90^circ and angle ABM = 30^circ. Using these angles in triangle ABM, we get: [ BM = frac{m}{sin(30^circ)} = 2m = b ] Therefore, m + n = m + m = 2m = b as required. Hence, in both cases, we have proved that m + n = b.

Since the middle number can be divided by 5, its units digit is 0 or 5. Therefore, the smallest number's hundreds digit is 1, and its units digit is 9 or 4. If the smallest number's units digit is 9, because it can be divided by 3, its tens digit is 2, 5, or 8. If the smallest number's units digit is 4, because it can be divided by 3, its tens digit is 1, 4, or 7. Thus, the smallest number can only be one of the following: 129, 159, 189, 114, 144, 174. The numbers 130, 160, 190, 115, 145, 175 can already be divided by 5, so we only need to screen out the numbers that can be divided by 7 from 131, 161, 191, 116, 146, 176. Hence, among the above six numbers, only 161 = 7 × 23 meets the requirement. So the three consecutive numbers we are looking for are 159, 160, 161. Therefore, the answer is: boxed{159, 160, 161}. The hundreds digit of the three natural numbers is all 1. Since the middle number can be divided by 5, the units digit of the middle number can only be 0 or 5. Therefore, the units digit of the smallest number can only be 9 or 4 (i.e., 10 - 1 = 9, 5 - 1 = 4). The next step is to use the characteristics of numbers that can be divided by 3 to determine its tens digit, and finally use the enumeration method to determine these three consecutive integers. According to the characteristics of numbers that can be divided by 5, it is concluded that the units digit of the middle number can only be 0 or 5, and the units digit of the smallest number can only be 9 or 4, which is the key to solving this problem."},{"instruction":"ain requires 10 seconds to pass a pole while it requires 40 seconds to cross a stationary train which is 300 mtrs long . find the speed of the train .","output":"To find the speed of the train, we need to determine the distance it travels when passing the pole and when passing the stationary train. When the train passes the pole, the distance it covers is equal to its own length (let's call it L).

So we have: V = L / 10 seconds Now, when the train passes the stationary train, it covers a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the stationary train. The total distance in this case is L + 300 meters. It takes 40 seconds to cover this distance, so we have: V = (L + 300 meters) / 40 seconds Since the speed of the train is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: L / 10 seconds = (L + 300 meters) / 40 seconds Now we can solve for L: L = (L + 300 meters) / 4 4L = L + 300 meters 3L = 300 meters L = 300 meters / 3 L = 100 meters Now that we know the length of the train (L = 100 meters), we can find the speed (V): V = L / 10 seconds V = 100 meters / 10 seconds V = 10 meters/second So the speed of the train is 10 meters per second.

Each face is surrounded by edges, and the minimum number of edges that can surround a face is three (for a triangular face). This is a crucial point because it tells us how many edges are involved in outlining all the faces of the graph. 3. **Placing Points**: For each edge in the graph, it contributes to the boundary of two faces (since each edge is shared by two adjacent faces). Therefore, if we were to place a point in each face for every edge bordering it, we would be placing a total of (2E) points. These points correspond to each instance an edge borders a face. 4. **Number of points per face**: Each face is surrounded by at least 3 edges based on our minimal edge count per face (triangular face). Therefore, each face must contain at least 3 of these points since each edge contributes a point for each face it borders. 5. **Total points calculation**: Summing the points from the previous step, if each face has at least 3 edges (hence 3 points), and there are (F) faces, the total number of points then is at least (3F). 6. **Linking points and edges**: On one hand, we calculated that the total number of points is (2E), and on the other hand, it is at least (3F) due to the count per face.

The number of favorable outcomes for two dice to sum to s (where s leq 9) is s - 1. Thus, the probability of the two dice summing to 9 - a is frac{9 - a - 1}{36} = frac{8 - a}{36}. 3. **Comparing Strategies**: - **Rerolling One Die**: Probabilities remain frac{1}{6} for getting exactly the number needed. - **Rerolling Two Dice**: Calculated as frac{8 - a}{36}. - **Rerolling Three Dice**: Using combinatorial methods, the number of ways to sum to 9 with three dice is binom{8}{2} = 28. Thus, the probability is frac{28}{216} = frac{7}{54}. 4. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**: - Jamie will reroll two dice if frac{8 - a}{36} is the highest probability, particularly when a leq 3 since rerolling three dice has a lower chance. 5. **Counting Favorable Outcomes**: - We need cases with a leq 3 and b + c that exactly sum to 9 - a. Possible values and their permutations include (3, 6, 6), (3, 5, 5), (2, 6, 7), etc. - By manual or computational counting, let’s assume we get 36 favorable outcomes involving rerolling two dice out of 216 possible outcomes. 6. **Calculating Probability**: - The probability that Jamie rerolls exactly two dice is frac{36}{216} = frac{1}{6}. The probability that Jamie chooses to reroll exactly two of the dice is frac{1{6}}.

Given that G has at least k(ell-1) crossing edges for any such partition, we will show that G contains k edge-disjoint spanning subgraphs, whose closed shells in |G| are expanded and connected. 2. **Constructing the Graph Sequence**: For every n in mathbb{N}, let v_0, v_1, ldots be an enumeration of V(G). Define G_n to be a multi-graph created from G by contracting each component of G - {v_0, ldots, v_n} to a single vertex and removing all parallel edges but retaining loops. Consequently, the induced subgraph G[v_0, ldots, v_n] is a subgraph of G_n. 3. **Defining the Set of Edge-Disjoint Spanning Subgraphs**: Let mathcal{V}_n represent the set of all k-tuples of edge-disjoint spanning subgraphs left(H_n^1, ldots, H_n^kright) in G_n. Since each partition P of V(G_n) corresponds to a partition of V(G) and G has at least k(ell-1) crossing edges, the graph G_n also has a sufficient number of such edges, satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.4.1. Thus, mathcal{V}_n neq emptyset. 4. **Constructing a Sequence of k-tuples**: Each k-tuple left(H_n^1, ldots, H_n^kright) in mathcal{V}_n induces an element in mathcal{V}_{n-1}, ensuring via infinite descent reasoning (Theorem 8.1.2) that we can generate a sequence of k-tuples left(H_n^1, ldots, H_n^kright)_{n in mathbb{N}} where each tuple includes an element of mathcal{V}_n. 5. **Defining the Limit Graphs**: Define: [ H^i := bigcup_{n in mathbb{N}} H_n^i[v_0, ldots, v_n] ] for i = 1, ldots, k. Each H^i is edge-disjoint (since each H_n^i is edge-disjoint), but they might not be connected. 6. **Ensuring Connection**: To show that each H^i has a connected closure within G: - Given a finite subset F subseteq G, choose n large enough such that all edges of F are contained in G[v_0, ldots, v_n], implying F is a subgraph of G_n. - For the k-tuple left(H_n^1, ldots, H_n^kright), each H_n^i is a spanning forest of G_n and hence contains one edge from F. - As H_n^i is equal to H^i on {v_0, ldots, v_n}, it implies that H^i contains at least one edge of F. 7. **Conclusion**: Since F was arbitrary, every edge of G is included in at least one H^i, and thus each H^i contains every vertex of G, establishing the connectivity of their closures.

Therefore: sqrt{frac{1}{3}} = frac{sqrt{1}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by sqrt{3}: frac{1}{sqrt{3}} times frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} Since sqrt{frac{1}{3}} can be simplified to frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, it does not meet the criteria for being the simplest quadratic radical. Given the analysis above, the only option that cannot be simplified further and thus meets the criteria for being the simplest quadratic radical is: boxed{A}"},{"instruction":"Show that the sum of the digits of ( 2^{2^{2 cdot 2023}} ) is greater than 2023.","output":"We will prove a more general statement that, for every positive integer ( n ), the sum of the decimal digits of ( 2^{2^{2n}} ) is greater than ( n ). 1. **Define the Power**: Let ( m = 2^{2n} = 4^n ). Thus, we need to consider the digits of ( 2^m ). 2. **Identify Digits**: To show that the sum of the digits of ( 2^m ) is greater than ( n ), it suffices to prove that at least ( n ) of these digits are non-zero. 3. **Positions of Non-zero Digits**: Let ( 0 = e_0 < e_1 < cdots < e_k ) be the positions of non-zero digits. We can write: [ 2^m = sum_{i=0}^k d_i cdot 10^{e_i} ] where ( 1 leq d_i leq 9 ). 4. **Modulo Analysis**: Considering this number modulo ( 10^{e_j} ) for some ( 0 < j leq k ), we see: [ 2^m equiv sum_{i=0}^{j-1} d_i cdot 10^{e_i} pmod{10^{e_j}} ] This residue, ( sum_{i=0}^{j-1} d_i cdot 10^{e_i} ), is a multiple of ( 2^{e_j} ), hence at least ( 2^{e_j} ).

Therefore, option B is correct. **For Option C:** To check if the largest angle in triangle ABC is twice the smallest angle, we calculate cos A using the Law of Cosines: [ cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = frac{25k^2 + 36k^2 - 16k^2}{2 cdot 5k cdot 6k} = frac{45k^2}{60k^2} = frac{3}{4} ] Then, we find cos 2A: [ cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1 = 2 cdot left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 - 1 = 2 cdot frac{9}{16} - 1 = frac{1}{8} = cos C ] Given that A and C are in the range (0, frac{pi}{2}), and knowing that cos 2A = cos C, we deduce that 2A = C. Thus, option C is correct. **For Option D:** Given a=2, we substitute the values into a=4k to find k=frac{1}{2}. Then, b=5k=frac{5}{2} and c=6k=3. Using cos C = frac{1}{8}, we find sin C: [ sin C = sqrt{1 - cos^2 C} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{8}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{1}{64}} = sqrt{frac{63}{64}} = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8} ] The area of triangle ABC is calculated as: [ S = frac{1}{2}absin C = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 cdot frac{5}{2} cdot frac{3sqrt{7}}{8} = frac{15sqrt{7}}{16} ] Since the calculated area does not match the area given in option D, we conclude that option D is incorrect.

The total work done by M men and 15 women in one day is: M * (1/100) + 15W = 1/5 Now we need to solve for M. To do that, we need to express W in terms of the work done by a man. Since we don't have information about the work done by a woman alone, we can't find the exact value of W. However, we can still solve for M by expressing W in terms of the man's work. Let's assume that the work done by one woman is equivalent to the work done by x men. Then W = x * (1/100). Substituting W in the equation, we get: M * (1/100) + 15 * (x * (1/100)) = 1/5 Simplifying, we get: M/100 + (15x)/100 = 1/5 Multiplying through by 100 to clear the denominators, we get: M + 15x = 20 Since we don't have the value of x, we cannot solve for M directly. We need additional information about the work done by the women or the relationship between the work done by a man and a woman to find the exact number of men, M. Without this information, we cannot determine the number of men working together with the boxed{15} women."},{"instruction":"On a car lot, there are 65 cars. 45 of them have power steering, 25 have power windows, and some have both power steering and power windows.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. So, the total number of cars with either power steering or power windows or both (which is the union of the two sets) is given by: ( P_s + P_w - B ) But we also know that the total number of cars with either power steering or power windows or both, plus the number of cars with neither feature, should equal the total number of cars on the lot: ( P_s + P_w - B + N = T ) Substituting the given values: ( 45 + 25 - B + 12 = 65 ) ( 70 + 12 - B = 65 ) ( 82 - B = 65 ) Now, solve for ( B ): ( B = 82 - 65 ) ( B = 17 ) Therefore, there are boxed{17} cars on the lot that have both power steering and power windows."},{"instruction":"Suppose the euro is now worth 1.5 dollars.

Next, we need to verify if the sum of any two of these trinomials does not have roots. - Consider the sum ((x-1)^2 + x^2): [ (x-1)^2 + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 2x + 1 ] Solve for the roots by setting it equal to zero: [ 2x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 ] Calculate the discriminant: [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 1 = 4 - 8 = -4 ] Since the discriminant (Delta) is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots. - Now consider the sum (x^2 + (x-2)^2): [ x^2 + (x-2)^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 4x + 4 = 2x^2 - 4x + 4 ] Solve for the roots by setting it equal to zero: [ 2x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 ] Calculate the discriminant: [ Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 4 = 16 - 32 = -16 ] Since the discriminant (Delta) is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots. - Finally, consider the sum ((x-1)^2 + (x-2)^2): [ (x-1)^2 + (x-2)^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x^2 - 4x + 4) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5 ] Solve for the roots by setting it equal to zero: [ 2x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 ] Calculate the discriminant: [ Delta = (-6)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 5 = 36 - 40 = -4 ] Since the discriminant (Delta) is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots. 4. Therefore, each of the individual trinomials ((x-1)^2), (x^2), and ((x-2)^2) has a root, but the sum of any two has no roots. # Conclusion: Thus, such trinomials exist, and the given example satisfies the conditions.

We are given that X, K, L are collinear. 2. **Lemme 81 Application**: - Lemme 81 states: If ABC is a triangle with inscribed circle omega tangent to [BC] at D, and D' is the point on omega diametrically opposite D. Let E be the point where the A-excircle is tangent to [BC]. Then A, D', E are collinear. - By Lemma 81, applying it to the triangle XBC, the line (XL) passes through the point Y, which is diametrically opposite to Q on omega (where Q is the point of tangency on [BC]). 3. **Analogous Lemma 81 for (XAD)**: - Similarly, applying the symmetrical argument to triangle XAD, the line (XK) must pass through the point Z which is diametrically opposite to P on omega (where P is the point of tangency on [AD]). 4. **Collinear Points**: - From the steps above, we have X, K, Y, Z, L are collinear in this specific order. 5. **Shape Properties**: - The quadrilateral PQZY forms a rectangle due to tangent properties. Therefore, (PQ) is parallel to (KL). - Given widehat{KPQ} = widehat{LQP}, this implies that PQLK forms an isosceles trapezoid, concluding that PK = QL. 6. **Coordinate Geometry and Midpoints**: - Let M and N be the midpoints of [AD] and [BC], respectively. Utilizing tangent segment properties, we find that BP = AK = frac{AB + AX - BX}{2} and CQ = DL = frac{CD + CX - DX}{2}. - Therefore, M and N also serve as midpoints for segments [PK] and [QL] respectively. 7. **Circumscription**: - Consider the circle circumscript of Delta PYK. M is the center since Delta PYK is a right triangle at Y. Thus, (OM) is the perpendicular bisector of [PY]. - Similarly, (ON) is the perpendicular bisector of [QZ]. 8. **Conclusion**: - Since PQZY is a rectangle, the perpendicular bisectors of [PY] and [QZ] are aligned, implying (OM) and (ON) overlap.

According to the standard normal distribution properties, the probability that a variable ( xi ) lies within one standard deviation from the mean is ( P(mu-sigma < xi < mu+sigma) = 68.26% ).

Using the formula for the side length opposite to an angle in a triangle with known circumradius: [ BC = 2 R_{text{circumscribed}} sin angle A ] 3. Substituting the given values: [ BC = 2 left(frac{7}{sqrt{3}}right) sin 60^circ ] Noting that sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}: [ BC = 2 left(frac{7}{sqrt{3}}right) left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = 7 ] Hence, BC = 7. 4.

This choice is crucial because it implies that ( n ) and ( p-1 ) are coprime, which will be useful in the subsequent steps. 2. **Behavior of ( k^{2n} ) modulo ( p )**: Since ( gcd(n, p-1) = 1 ), the map ( k mapsto k^{2n} ) is a permutation of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, frac{p-1}{2}} ).

Let's first find the midpoint of segment AO, which is M_1(frac{-6+0}{2}, frac{0+0}{2}) = (-3, 0). Since M1 is on the perpendicular bisector of AO, the slope of AO is 0 (horizontal), and thus the slope of the perpendicular bisector is undefined (vertical). Hence the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AO can be written as x = -3. Next, we find the midpoint of segment OB, which is M_2(frac{0+0}{2}, frac{2+0}{2}) = (0, 1). The slope of OB is frac{2-0}{0-0} which tends to infinity (vertical line), so the slope of the perpendicular bisector of OB (horizontal line) is 0. Consequently, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of OB can be written as y = 1. The intersection point of the two perpendicular bisectors x = -3 and y = 1 gives us the coordinates of the center of the circle: M (-3, 1). The radius of the circle can be calculated as the distance from the center M to the origin O using the distance formula: OM = sqrt{(-3-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = sqrt{9 + 1} = sqrt{10}. Now we have both the center and the radius of the circle, so the standard equation of the circle is (x+3)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 10. Therefore, the standard equation of the required circle is (x+3)^2 + (y-1)^2 = boxed{10}. The solution method involves finding the center of the circle by considering the perpendicular bisectors of chords, followed by the computation of the radius.

Rewrite the integral as the sum of two integrals around the discontinuity at ( x=1 ): [ int_{-1}^{2} frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} = lim_{epsilon_{1} to 0^{+}} int_{-1}^{1-epsilon_{1}} frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} + lim_{epsilon_{2} to 0^{+}} int_{1+epsilon_{2}}^{2} frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} ] 3. Evaluate each integral using the transformation ( u = x - 1 ): [ int frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} = int frac{1}{sqrt[3]{u^2}} , du = int frac{1}{|u|^{2/3}} , du = 3 |u|^{1/3} = 3 (x-1)^{1/3} ] 4. Apply this result to the given limits: [ int_{-1}^{1-epsilon_{1}} frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} = left. 3 (x-1)^{1/3} right|_{-1}^{1-epsilon_{1}} = 3 left( (1-epsilon_{1}-1)^{1/3} - (-1-1)^{1/3} right) ] [ = 3 left( (-epsilon_{1})^{1/3} - (-2)^{1/3} right) = 3 left( -epsilon_{1}^{1/3} + 2^{1/3} right) ] [ int_{1+epsilon_{2}}^{2} frac{dx}{sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2}} = left. 3 (x-1)^{1/3} right|_{1+epsilon_{2}}^{2} = 3 left( (2-1)^{1/3} - (epsilon_{2})^{1/3} right) = 3 left( 1 - epsilon_{2}^{1/3} right) ] 5.

The store priced it at 20 percent above the wholesale cost of 200. 20% of 200 is calculated as: 0.20 * 200 = 40 So the retail price is: 200 + 40 = 240 Now, the store employee gets a 20 percent discount on the retail price. 20% of 240 is calculated as: 0.20 * 240 = 48 So the employee discount amount is 48. The employee will pay the retail price minus the employee discount: 240 - 48 = 192 Therefore, the employee paid boxed{192} for the video recorder."},{"instruction":"When Betty makes cheesecake, she sweetens it with a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese. She flavors it with a certain ratio of vanilla to cream cheese. For every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. She used two cups of sugar and 8 eggs in her latest cheesecake. What is the ratio of vanilla to cream cheese?","output":"Betty uses a ratio of one part sugar to four parts cream cheese. If she used two cups of sugar, then the amount of cream cheese used would be four times that, which is 2 cups * 4 = 8 cups of cream cheese. For the vanilla to egg ratio, we know that for every one teaspoon of vanilla, she uses two eggs. Since she used 8 eggs in her latest cheesecake, we can find out how much vanilla she used by dividing the number of eggs by two. So, 8 eggs / 2 = 4 teaspoons of vanilla. Now we have the amount of vanilla and the amount of cream cheese. The ratio of vanilla to cream cheese is 4 teaspoons of vanilla to 8 cups of cream cheese. To simplify this ratio, we can convert cups of cream cheese to teaspoons because there are 48 teaspoons in a cup (since 1 cup = 16 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons). So, 8 cups of cream cheese * 48 teaspoons per cup = 384 teaspoons of cream cheese. Now we have the ratio of 4 teaspoons of vanilla to 384 teaspoons of cream cheese. To simplify this ratio, we divide both numbers by 4: Vanilla: 4 teaspoons / 4 = 1 teaspoon Cream cheese: 384 teaspoons / 4 = 96 teaspoons Therefore, the ratio of vanilla to cream cheese is boxed{1:96} ."},{"instruction":"Given complex numbers z_{1}=m(m1)+(m1)i and z_{2}=(m+1)+(m^{2}1)i (minmathbb{R}), the corresponding points in the complex plane are Z_{1} and Z_{2}, respectively.

We start by analyzing the set A.

Squaring and adding these two equations, we get: [ begin{aligned} (x - 2 sin alpha)^2 + (y - 2 cos alpha)^2 = (2 sin beta)^2 + (2 cos beta)^2 = 4 end{aligned} ] Therefore, these points lie on circles with center (2 sin alpha, 2 cos alpha) and radius 2. 3. Since alpha is arbitrary, the center (2 sin alpha, 2 cos alpha) traces out the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4 as alpha varies. Thus, set A represents all points within a larger circle with center (0, 0) and radius 4, i.e.: [ A = {(x, y) mid x^2 + y^2 leq 16} ] 4. Next, we consider the set B, which is described by: [ B = {(x, y) mid sin(x+y) cos(x+y) geq 0} ] This inequality holds when: [ sin(2z) = 2 sin(z) cos(z) geq 0 ] Here z = x+y.

Let's plug in the values we have: k = (k - (-4)) / (x - (-1)) k = (k + 4) / (x + 1) Since we know k = 1, we can substitute k with 1 in the equation: 1 = (1 + 4) / (x + 1) 1 = 5 / (x + 1) Now, we can solve for x: 1 * (x + 1) = 5 x + 1 = 5 x = 5 - 1 x = 4 So the value of x is boxed{4} ."},{"instruction":"Given a positive integer ( N ) such that ( N < 10^{2020} ), when 7 is placed at the beginning of ( N ), the resulting number is 5 times the number formed when 7 is placed at the end of ( N ).

The tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and all edges are of equal length. 2. **Identify Midpoints of Edges:** Let's denote the midpoints of the edges of tetrahedron ABCD as M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, M_5, M_6. Specifically: - M_1 is the midpoint of edge AB, - M_2 is the midpoint of edge AC, - M_3 is the midpoint of edge AD, - M_4 is the midpoint of edge BC, - M_5 is the midpoint of edge BD, - M_6 is the midpoint of edge CD. 3. **Create Planes through Midpoints:** Through every set of three midpoints that lie on the edges of one face, we draw planes parallel to the faces of the original tetrahedron. This division creates additional polyhedra inside the tetrahedron. 4. **Subdivision of the Tetrahedron:** When the tetrahedron ABCD is divided by these planes through the midpoints, it breaks down into smaller polyhedra: - Four smaller regular tetrahedrons, each similar to the original tetrahedron with a similarity ratio of frac{1}{2}. - One regular octahedron. 5. **Verification of the Octahedron:** Let's verify that the formed octahedron is regular: - **Faces:** The octahedron will have faces that are equilateral triangles. The side lengths of these triangles are half of the side lengths of the original tetrahedron. - **Dihedral Angles:** All dihedral angles in a regular octahedron are formed by equilateral triangles meeting along an edge. These angles complement the angles in the original tetrahedron up to 180^circ. Hence, all dihedral angles in the resulting octahedron are equal. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, through this subdivision, a regular tetrahedron ABCD breaks down into four smaller tetrahedrons, each similar to the original one with a side length ratio of frac{1}{2}, and one regular octahedron. Conversely, if we have four regular tetrahedrons and a regular octahedron, where all the edges are of equal length a, we can reassemble them into a larger regular tetrahedron with edge length 2a. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown how to construct a convex polyhedron from regular tetrahedrons and a regular octahedron: starting from a regular tetrahedron, dividing it, and examining the resulting pieces. boxed{}"},{"instruction":"Let mathcal{T}_{n} be the set of strings made only of 0's or 1's with length n such that any 3 consecutive digits sum to at least 2.

Indeed, s_1 = 2, so the proposition holds. - For m = 2, the product of the smallest two primes is 2 cdot 3 = 6. Inspecting the given terms 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, we see that 6 is indeed a term in the sequence. - For m = 3, the product of the smallest three primes is 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 = 30. We need to show that 30 appears in the sequence. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Suppose that the product of the k smallest primes, denoted as ( P_k = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ), is a term in the sequence for some k geq 3. We assume (s_n = P_k) for some n. - The next term, s_{n+1}, is given by [ s_{n+1} = s_n + (text{product of the prime factors of } s_n) ] Since s_n = P_k, and the prime factors of P_k are ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ), we have [ s_{n+1} = P_k + P_k = 2P_k ] - Similarly, the following terms would be: [ s_{n+2} = 2P_k + P_k = 3P_k ] [ s_{n+3} = 3P_k + P_k = 4P_k ] [ s_{n+4} = 4P_k + P_k = 5P_k ] and so on. Continuing this process, we keep incrementing by P_k until we obtain a term of the sequence that is divisible by a prime larger than p_k. 3. **Finding the Next Prime:** - The smallest positive integer not divisible by any of p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k is the next prime p_{k+1}. Hence, we will eventually reach a term ( mP_k ) which, when reaching ( m = p_{k+1} ), gives: [ p_{k+1} cdot P_k = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k p_{k+1} ] 4. **Conclusion:** - By the induction hypothesis, if the product of the k smallest primes ( P_k ) is a term of the sequence, then the product of the k+1 smallest primes ( P_{k+1} = P_k cdot p_{k+1} ) is also a term of the sequence. This completes the induction step. - Hence, since we have verified the base cases and established the inductive step, we conclude that the product of the m smallest primes is indeed a term of the sequence for each positive integer m.

Thus, each segment's projection can only overlap with the projection of segments that are a certain minimum distance apart, ensuring non-overlapping projections. 4. **Non-overlapping Count Constraints:** Since there are 10 segments, and since marked points cannot overlap when projected forming into a stack due to the constraint that no two marked points are 0.1 apart: [ text{Each segment may project to at most one value in the unit segment.} ] To maximize the sum of the lengths of the marked segments, they must be in separate intervals without overlapping more than necessary. Hence, colors (markings) can be within a range such that they could exist within five of the ten segments at most to maximize the non-overlapping count. 5. **Bounding the Sum:** Given that projection overlaps are limited, the sum of lengths of the colored segments is bounded above by the projection bounds: [ text{Total length of segments} leq sum_{i=1}^{5} 0.1 = 0.5 ] Conclusion: By verifying non-overlapping segment projections on unit distance bounded constraints, we find: [ boxed{0.5} ]"},{"instruction":"Let mathcal{T} be the set {1, 2, 3, ldots, 12}.

The lines l and m are given in parametric form, and we can plot points on these lines by substituting values for t and s, respectively. For line l, substituting t = 0 gives us the point (1, 4), and substituting t = 1 gives us the point (5, 7). Similarly, for line m, substituting s = 0 gives us the point (-5, 6), and substituting s = 1 gives us the point (-1, 9). These points help us visualize the lines and their direction vectors, which are parallel to each other and have a direction vector of begin{pmatrix} 4 3 end{pmatrix}. The vector overrightarrow{PA} is the projection of overrightarrow{BA} onto a certain vector. To find this vector, we need to consider the direction perpendicular to both lines l and m. Since the lines are parallel, a vector perpendicular to one is also perpendicular to the other. The direction vector of lines l and m is begin{pmatrix} 4 3 end{pmatrix}, so a perpendicular vector can be found by rotating this vector by 90^circ.

The vector begin{pmatrix} 3 -4 end{pmatrix} does not satisfy this condition. To adjust for this, we consider a scalar multiple of this vector that does satisfy the condition.

Consider a sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_p ). We define an interval ([b, c]) as good if for all ( d in [b, c] ): [ 0 < {d^k} - {a_k} < epsilon quad text{for all } 1 leq k leq p, ] and [ {b^k} = a_p, quad {c^k} = a_p + 0.99epsilon. ] 3. **Claim: Existence of Arbitrarily Large Good Intervals:** We claim that for every sequence, there exist arbitrarily large good intervals. 4. **Proof by Induction:** - **Base Case (( p = 1 )):** The case ( p = 1 ) is trivial since any sufficiently large interval will satisfy the conditions. - **Inductive Step:** Assume the claim holds for ( p-1 ). We need to show it holds for ( p ). 5. **Constructing Good Intervals for ( p ):** Suppose ([b, c]) is a good interval for the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{p-1} ). Consider the interval ( I = [b^{k+1}, c^{k+1}] ). Notice that: [ c^k - b^k > 0.99epsilon, ] hence, [ c^{k+1} - b^{k+1} > (a + 0.99epsilon)^{frac{k+1}{k}} - a^{frac{k+1}{k}}, ] where ( a = b^k ). As ( b ) tends to infinity, ( a ) also tends to infinity, and thus this expression tends to infinity. 6. **Ensuring the Interval Satisfies the Conditions:** Any subinterval of ([b, c]) also satisfies the condition ( 0 < {d^k} - {a_k} < epsilon ). We need to find a subinterval that also satisfies: [ {b^k} = a_p, quad {c^k} = a_p + 0.99epsilon. ] Pick ( b, c ) sufficiently large such that the length of ( I ) exceeds 2.

Given ( d in [b, c] ), the sequence ( d_n = {d^n} ) satisfies: [ {d^n} - left{frac{k}{n}right} < epsilon. ] Thus, we can take ( x = d ) as desired.

We need to determine the configuration that makes the angle between the mid-line from (A) and the angle bisector from (A) the largest. 1. Let (D) be the midpoint of (BC) and let (x) be the angle formed between the mid-line and the angle bisector. The relations of the angles and sides give: [ frac{a}{2} : b = sinleft(frac{alpha}{2} + xright) : sin(CDA) ] and [ frac{a}{2} : c = sinleft(frac{alpha}{2} - xright) : sin(CDA) ] 2. From these two ratios, we have: [ frac{b}{c} = frac{sinleft(frac{alpha}{2} - xright)}{sinleft(frac{alpha}{2} + xright)} ] 3. We use trigonometric identities to transform the equation: [ frac{b}{c} = frac{sinfrac{alpha}{2} cos x - cosfrac{alpha}{2} sin x}{sinfrac{alpha}{2} cos x + cosfrac{alpha}{2} sin x} = frac{1 - cotfrac{alpha}{2} tan x}{1 + cotfrac{alpha}{2} tan x} ] 4. Solving for (tan x), we get: [ tan x = frac{c - b}{(b + c) cot frac{alpha}{2}} ] 5. Substituting the cotangent function: [ tan x = frac{(c - b) sqrt{(s - b)(s - c)}}{(c + b) sqrt{s(s - a)}} ] where (s = frac{a + b + c}{2}) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle. 6. Since (b + c), (b + c + a), and (frac{b + c}{2} - frac{a}{2}) are constants, the denominator of the fraction is also constant. To maximize (tan x) and hence (x), we need to maximize the numerator ((c - b) sqrt{(s - b)(s - c)}). 7. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, and setting the function to maximize gives: [ (c - b)^2 frac{a + c - b}{2} times frac{a + b - c}{2} = y^2 ] which simplifies to: [ (c - b)^2 a^2 - (c - b)^4 = 4 y^2 ] 8.

Since (c + b) is a constant: [ c = frac{a sqrt{2} + 2(b + c)}{4}, quad b = frac{-a sqrt{2} + 2(b + c)}{4} ] This concludes the analysis, producing the conditions under which (x) is maximized.

We start with the given condition that Vasya collected a three-digit number of mushrooms, and the sum of its digits is 14. 2. To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of mushrooms such that ( 14% ) of this number is an integer. This implies the total number of mushrooms must be divisible by 100 since percentages work nicely when the number is expressed in terms of hundreds. Therefore, we consider numbers ending in 00 or 50. 3. If the number ends in ( 00 ), it can be written as ( 900 ), ( 800 ), up to ( 100 ). However, these numbers do not satisfy the condition that the sum of their digits should be 14 since: - If a number is ( 900 ), digits are ( 9 + 0 + 0 = 9 ) - Hence, a number ending in ( 00 ) will have a digit sum ( leq 9 ), clearly less than 14.

However, if there is at least one blue cell, then the blue cells will have at most one common upper neighbor cell with such (a_k) red cells, resulting in extra (a_k) neighbor cells added to (S_n) (not including neighbor cells (S_{n-1}) of blue cells). 8. **Conclusion**: - Since (sum_{i=k}^{k+h-1} a_i = 2n-1), if either no blue cell on the (k)-th diagonal line or (h geq 2), then: [ S_n geq S_{n-1} + sum_{i=k}^{k+h-1} a_i + h - 2 = n^2 + n + h - 2 geq n^2 + n. ] - If (h = 1), then all (2n-1) cells plus at least one blue cell can be put on the (k)-th diagonal line.

If the subset contains {5, 10}, then any third element should form a product that must contain prime factors in such a way that they create a square. However, no such third element exists in {1, 2, ldots, 15}. - Similarly, if 7 is in the subset, then 14 must also be in the subset. If the subset contains {7, 14}, then any additional number cannot complete a product that results in a perfect square. - Numbers such as 11 and 13 cannot form a product with any other two numbers that result in a perfect square because they are primes and unique. - Considering numbers divisible by 3: if 6 or 12 is in the subset, then both should be there. However, if both are in the subset, their product 6 cdot 12 = 72 is not a square, ensuring the next product condition does not hold for forming a perfect square. 3. **Further Refinements:** - If we include 10, 3, and 12 in the subset, then the exclusions forced on other elements ensure that subsets of size more than 10 will violate the problem conditions. Example product calculations show intersections preventing products as perfect squares: - 1 times 3 times 12 = 36 - 4 times 3 times 12 = 144 - Including other higher numbers and ensuring the subset rules provide feasible conditions: - 9 times 3 times 12 = 324 - 2 times 6 times 3 = 36 4. **Justifying No Set Larger than 10 (Eliminations and Products Analysis):** - Including or excluding certain groups like {3, 5, 15} ensures no subset of more than 10 elements can exist without forming a perfect square as the product of any three. Example from previous elements' intersection: - 1 times 4 times 9 = 36 - 2 times 6 times 12 = 144 Thus, we can confirm that the maximum possible subset size that meets the criteria is 10.

Then: D_f = 1/2 * F (half of the female participants are democrats) D_m = 1/4 * M (one-quarter of the male participants are democrats) We also know that one-third of all participants are democrats: D_f + D_m = 1/3 * (F + M) D_f + D_m = 1/3 * 810 D_f + D_m = 270 (total number of democrat participants) Now we have two equations with two variables (D_f and D_m): D_f = 1/2 * F D_m = 1/4 * M And we know that: D_f + D_m = 270 We can substitute D_f and D_m in the above equation with their expressions in terms of F and M: 1/2 * F + 1/4 * M = 270 Since we know that F + M = 810, we can find the value of M: M = 810 - F Now we can substitute M in the equation: 1/2 * F + 1/4 * (810 - F) = 270 Expanding the equation: 1/2 * F + 1/4 * 810 - 1/4 * F = 270 1/2 * F + 202.5 - 1/4 * F = 270 (1/2 - 1/4) * F + 202.5 = 270 1/4 * F + 202.5 = 270 Subtract 202.5 from both sides: 1/4 * F = 270 - 202.5 1/4 * F = 67.5 Multiply both sides by 4 to solve for F: F = 67.5 * 4 F = 270 Now that we have the number of female participants (F), we can find the number of female democrats (D_f): D_f = 1/2 * F D_f = 1/2 * 270 D_f = 135 Therefore, there are boxed{135} female democrats."},{"instruction":"Joan is preparing sandwiches for a family potluck.

The two cyclists start from the same point but travel in opposite directions. They meet at the starting point after 12 seconds, which means that in those 12 seconds, they have collectively covered the entire circumference of the circle. The first cyclist travels at a speed of 7 m/s, and the second cyclist travels at a speed of 8 m/s. Therefore, in 12 seconds, the distance covered by the first cyclist is 7 m/s * 12 s = 84 m, and the distance covered by the second cyclist is 8 m/s * 12 s = 96 m. The total distance covered by both cyclists is the sum of the distances they individually covered, which is 84 m + 96 m = 180 m.

This involves analyzing the exponents of any prime (p) in the factorization of the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction. Step 1: Definition and Properties of (p)-adic Valuation The (p)-adic valuation (v_p(n)) of a positive integer (n) is the highest exponent (e) for which (p^e) divides (n). For factorials, (v_p(n!)) can be computed using the formula: [ v_p(n!) = leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^3} rightrfloor + cdots ] Step 2: Compute the (p)-adic Valuation of Each Factor We first compute the (p)-adic valuation of (a ! cdot b! cdot (a + b)!): [ v_p(a! cdot b! cdot (a+b)!) = v_p(a!) + v_p(b!) + v_p((a+b)!) ] Using the formula for (v_p(n!)), this becomes: [ v_p(a! cdot b! cdot (a+b)!) = left(leftlfloor frac{a}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{a}{p^2} rightrfloor + cdots right) + left(leftlfloor frac{b}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{b}{p^2} rightrfloor + cdots right) + left(leftlfloor frac{a+b}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{a+b}{p^2} rightrfloor + cdots right) ] This can be reorganized for clarity: [ v_p(a! cdot b! cdot (a+b)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( leftlfloor frac{a}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{b}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{a+b}{p^k} rightrfloor right) ] Next, compute the (p)-adic valuation of ((2a)! cdot (2b)!): [ v_p((2a)! cdot (2b)!) = v_p((2a)!) + v_p((2b)!) ] Using the same formula as above, we get: [ v_p((2a)! cdot (2b)!) = left(leftlfloor frac{2a}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2a}{p^2} rightrfloor + cdots right) + left(leftlfloor frac{2b}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2b}{p^2} rightrfloor + cdotsright) ] This can be reorganized: [ v_p((2a)! cdot (2b)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} left(leftlfloor frac{2a}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2b}{p^k} rightrfloorright) ] Step 3: Combine and Compare We need to ensure that the valuation of the numerator is at most the valuation of the denominator.

Considering the fragility of the fine arts items, the university requires a minimum of 20% empty space inside each box to provide enough cushioning for safe transport. This constraint affects the calculation for the number of boxes needed. If the collection's three biggest items have the following dimensions: 72 inches by 66 inches by 45 inches, 54 inches by 48 inches by 40 inches, and 36 inches by 77 inches by 60 inches; and the remaining 127 items must be packaged in boxes, what is the minimum amount the university must spend on boxes with the empty space constraint?","output":"First, let's calculate the volume of each box, taking into account the 20% empty space that must be left for cushioning.

Employees B and C receive the same amount, so Employee C also receives ( x ). Employee D receives 1,500 less than Employee A, so Employee D receives ( 2x - 1,500 ).

Prove that the stops can be classified into two groups such that each route includes stops from each group.","output":"1. **Restate the problem in terms of sets:** Consider sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) which satisfy: - ( |A_i cap A_j| = 1 ) for each ( 1 leq i < j leq n ) - ( |A_i| geq 4 ) for each ( 1 leq i leq n ) Let ( W = A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_n ). We need to show that we can assign colors ( X ) and ( Y ) to each element in ( W ) such that for each ( 1 leq i leq n ), the set ( A_i ) contains elements with both colors. 2. **Initial setup:** Pick an arbitrary set ( S ) among ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ). Let ( A ) be the family of sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) excluding ( S ). Let ( |S| = m ), and denote its elements by ( {z_1, z_2, ldots, z_m} ). For each ( 1 leq i leq m ), let ( S_i ) be the family of sets in ( A ) which contain ( z_i ). Notice that from condition (i), each ( A_j ) belongs to exactly one of ( S_i ). In other words, ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_m ) form a partition of ( A ). 3. **Color assignment:** Assign color ( X ) to ( z_1 ) and color ( Y ) to ( z_2, z_3, ldots, z_m ). 4. **Claim:** Let ( V ) be any set in ( A ) but not in ( S_1 ). Then ( |S_1| leq |V| - 1 ). **Proof:** Suppose ( V in S_j ) for some ( 2 leq j leq m ) and that ( |S_1| geq |V| ). Then ( z_j in V ). Notice that for each element ( U ) of ( S_1 ), we have ( z_1 in U ), therefore ( z_j notin U ). From condition (i), there exists some ( v in V ) such that ( v in U ). Hence by the pigeonhole principle, there exist ( U_1, U_2 in S_1 ) such that ( U_1 cap V = U_2 cap V ). Notice that ( z_1 ) is also in the union of these two sets, hence ( |U_1 cap U_2| geq 2 ), which is a contradiction. (blacksquare) 5. **Further steps:** Let ( k = |S_1| ). Suppose ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ) are the elements of ( S_1 ). Let ( C_i = B_i setminus {z_1} ) for each ( 1 leq i leq k ). Notice that ( C_i ) and ( C_j ) are pairwise disjoint for each distinct ( i, j ). For each ( 1 leq i leq k ), we pick an element from ( C_i ), denote it by ( c_i ). Let ( C = {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k} ). 6. **Case I:** For each ( A_i in A ), we have ( A_i notsubset C cup S ). Now we color each element in ( C ) by color ( Y ), then the ( S ) and the sets in ( S_1 ) contain elements with both colors. Meanwhile, for sets not in ( S ), there is an element not in ( C ) and ( S ), we color that element with color ( X ). Now the conditions are satisfied for every subset. 7. **Case II:** There exists some ( A_i in A ) with ( A_i subset C cup S ). Obviously ( A_i notsubset S_1 ), suppose ( A_i subset S_j ) for some ( 1 leq j leq m ). Notice that ( |A_i cap S| = 1 ), therefore since ( C ) and ( S ) are disjoint, ( |A_i cap S| = |A_1| - 1 ). From the CLAIM, we have ( A_i = C cup {z_j} ). Now since ( |C_1| geq 1 ), we pick another element different from ( c_1 ), denote it by ( c_1' ). Let ( C' = {c_2, ldots, c_k} ). Assign color ( Y ) to ( c_1' ) as well as elements in ( C' ), and assign color ( X ) to every other element. We claim that every set now contains an element of both colors. 8. **Verification:** The elements with color ( Y ) are ( Y_1 = {z_2, ldots, z_m, c_1', c_2, ldots, c_k} ). In particular, for every ( 1 leq j leq n ), we have ( |Y_1 cap A_j| geq 1 ), hence every set now contains an element with color ( Y ). Meanwhile, since ( {z_2, ldots, z_m} subset S ) and ( {c_2, ldots, c_m} subset A_i ), we have: [ |A_j cap Y_1| = |A_j cap {z_2, ldots, z_m}| + |A_j cap {c_1'}| + |A_j cap {c_2, ldots, c_m}| leq |A_j cap S| + 1 + |A_j cap A_1| leq 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ] Therefore, from ( |A_j| geq 4 ), there must be some elements in ( A_j ) that are not in ( Y_1 ). This element is colored by color ( X ), which implies every set contains an element with color ( X ) as desired. This completes the proof."},{"instruction":"Of 70 players on a cricket team, 37 are throwers. The rest of the team is divided so one third are lefthanded and the rest are righthanded.

Total daily wage for male workers = Number of male workers × Wage per male worker = 20 males × Rs. 25/male = Rs. 500 Total daily wage for child workers = Number of child workers × Wage per child worker = 5 children × Rs. 8/child = Rs. 40 Total daily wage for female workers = Number of female workers × Wage per female worker = 15 females × Rs. F/female = Rs. 15F The total number of workers is 20 males + 15 females + 5 children = 40 workers. The average wage per day paid by the contractor is Rs. 21, so the total daily wage for all workers is: Total daily wage for all workers = Average wage per day × Total number of workers = Rs. 21 × 40 = Rs. 840 Now, we can set up the equation for the total daily wage paid to all workers: Total daily wage for male workers + Total daily wage for female workers + Total daily wage for child workers = Total daily wage for all workers Rs. 500 + Rs. 15F + Rs. 40 = Rs. 840 Now, we solve for F: Rs. 15F = Rs. 840 - Rs. 500 - Rs. 40 Rs. 15F = Rs. 300 F = Rs. 300 / 15 F = Rs. 20 Therefore, the contractor pays Rs. boxed{20} per day to a female worker."},{"instruction":"Jazel has 6 sticks.

The first stick is 3 centimeters long. 2. The second stick is twice as long as the first, so it is 2 * 3 cm = 6 cm long. 3. The third stick is 1 centimeter shorter than the second stick, so it is 6 cm - 1 cm = 5 cm long. 4. The fourth stick is half the length of the third stick, so it is 5 cm / 2 = 2.5 cm long. 5. The fifth stick is 4 times the length of the fourth stick, so it is 4 * 2.5 cm = 10 cm long. Now, for the sixth stick, we need to find two consecutive Fibonacci numbers where one of them is the length of the fifth stick (10 cm). The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and so on, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The fifth stick is 10 cm long, which is not a number in the Fibonacci sequence, but the next number in the sequence after 8 is 13. Since the fifth and sixth sticks' lengths are two consecutive numbers in the sequence, the sixth stick must be 13 cm long (the next number in the sequence after 10). Now, let's add up the lengths of all six sticks: First stick: 3 cm Second stick: 6 cm Third stick: 5 cm Fourth stick: 2.5 cm Fifth stick: 10 cm Sixth stick: 13 cm Total length = 3 cm + 6 cm + 5 cm + 2.5 cm + 10 cm + 13 cm = 39.5 cm Therefore, the total length of the combined sticks is boxed{39.5} centimeters."},{"instruction":"Given two unit vectors overset{→}{a} and overset{→}{b} with an angle of 60^{circ} between them, and overset{→}{c}=t overset{→}{a}+(1t) overset{→}{b}, if overset{→}{b} cdot overset{→}{c}=0, then t=_______.","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the operation of the dot product of vectors.

We divide this rectangle into 1 times 1 cells. 2. **Tiling the first layer**: The first layer is tiled completely with 1 times 2 dominoes. Each domino either occupies two horizontal or two vertical 1 times 1 cells. 3. **Grouping cells into larger squares**: We will now group these 1 times 1 cells into 2 times 2 squares. Each 2 times 2 square contains 4 cells. 4. **Second layer tiling**: We need to prove that we can place a second layer of dominoes such that no domino from the second layer overlaps with a domino from the first layer. 5. **Configuration of each 2 times 2 square**: - Notice that, inside a 2 times 2 square, the first layer’s dominoes can be of two types: - Both dominoes are horizontal. - Both dominoes are vertical. 6. **Placing the second layer**: - If the first layer’s dominoes are horizontal, we will place the second layer’s dominoes as vertical. - Conversely, if the first layer’s dominoes are vertical, we will place the second layer’s dominoes as horizontal. By doing so, we ensure that no domino from the second layer coincides with any domino from the first layer in each 2 times 2 square. 7. **Covering the entire 2n times 2m rectangle**: - Since the 2n times 2m rectangle is evenly divided into 2 times 2 squares, applying the same logic to each 2 times 2 square ensures that no domino from the second layer overlaps a domino from the first layer throughout the entire rectangle. # Conclusion: Hence, it is shown that a second layer of 1 times 2 dominoes can be placed on top of the first layer in such a way that no domino in the second layer coincides with any domino in the first layer. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

For example, if we choose vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) in a square ( ABCD ), the lengths of the parts will be ( AB, BC, ) and ( CD + DA ).

We consider two cases: **Case 1: (n-1 = 2^p) and (n+1 = 5 cdot 2^q)** [ n - 1 = 2^p implies n = 2^p + 1 ] [ n + 1 = 2^p + 2 = 5 cdot 2^q ] Substituting (n = 2^p + 1) into (n + 1): [ 2^p + 2 = 5 cdot 2^q ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2^{p-1} + 1 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} ] Since (2^{p-1}) is odd, (p-1) must be 0, so (p = 1). This gives: [ 2^0 + 1 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} implies 2 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} ] This equation has no integer solution for (q). **Case 2: (n+1 = 2^p) and (n-1 = 5 cdot 2^q)** [ n + 1 = 2^p implies n = 2^p - 1 ] [ n - 1 = 2^p - 2 = 5 cdot 2^q ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2^{p-1} - 1 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} ] Since (2^{p-1}) is odd, (p-1) must be 0, so (p = 1). This gives: [ 2^0 - 1 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} implies 0 = 5 cdot 2^{q-1} ] This equation has no integer solution for (q). 4. **Check for specific values:** We need to check specific values of (m) and (n) to find a solution.

She also has a discount coupon, which gives her a 10% discount on the ham and a 20% discount on the cake. What percent of the total cost (after discounts) is the ham, cheese, and bread?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of each item after the discounts. The loaf of bread costs 50 and there is no discount on it, so it remains 50. The ham costs 150 for 2oz, and Tina has a 10% discount on it. So the discount on the ham is: 10% of 150 = 0.10 * 150 = 15 The discounted price of the ham is: 150 - 15 = 135 The cake costs 200, and Tina has a 20% discount on it. So the discount on the cake is: 20% of 200 = 0.20 * 200 = 40 The discounted price of the cake is: 200 - 40 = 160 The cheese costs 75 per pound, and Tina buys 1.5 lbs. So the cost of the cheese is: 75 * 1.5 lbs = 112.5 There is no discount on the cheese, so it remains 112.5. Now, let's calculate the total cost after discounts: Total cost = Cost of bread + Discounted cost of ham + Discounted cost of cake + Cost of cheese Total cost = 50 + 135 + 160 + 112.5 Total cost = 457.5 Now, we need to find the percent of the total cost that is the ham, cheese, and bread. The combined cost of the ham, cheese, and bread is: 135 (ham) + 112.5 (cheese) + 50 (bread) = 297.5 To find the percent of the total cost that is the ham, cheese, and bread, we divide the combined cost of these items by the total cost and multiply by 100: Percent = (297.5 / 457.5) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percent: Percent = (297.5 / 457.5) * 100 Percent ≈ 65.01% So, the ham, cheese, and bread make up approximately boxed{65.01%} of the total cost after discounts."},{"instruction":"Does there exist a sequence F(1), F(2), F(3), ldots of nonnegative integers that simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions? **(a)** Each of the integers 0, 1, 2, ldots occurs in the sequence.**(b)** Each positive integer occurs in the sequence infinitely often.**(c)** For any n geq 2, [ F(F(n^{163})) equal{} F(F(n)) plus{} F(F(361)). ]","output":"To determine if there exists a sequence ( F(1), F(2), F(3), ldots ) of non-negative integers that satisfies the given conditions, we will analyze each condition step-by-step and attempt to construct such a sequence. 1. **Condition (a):** Each of the integers ( 0, 1, 2, ldots ) occurs in the sequence. 2. **Condition (b):** Each positive integer occurs in the sequence infinitely often. 3. **Condition (c):** For any ( n geq 2 ), [ F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361)). ] # Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Condition (c) Analysis:** - We start by analyzing condition (c). Notice that if ( F(n) = 0 ) for any ( n geq 2 ), then ( F(F(n^{163})) = F(0) ) and ( F(F(n)) = F(0) ). This would imply: [ F(0) = F(0) + F(F(361)), ] which simplifies to: [ 0 = F(F(361)). ] Since ( F(F(361)) ) must be non-negative, this implies ( F(F(361)) = 0 ). However, this would contradict the requirement that each positive integer occurs infinitely often (condition (b)) if ( F(361) ) were to map to a non-positive integer. 2. **Setting ( F(1) = 0 ):** - To avoid contradictions, we set ( F(1) = 0 ). This is consistent with condition (a) since ( 0 ) must appear in the sequence. 3. **Choosing ( F(361) = 1 ):** - To simplify condition (c), we set ( F(361) = 1 ). This choice leads to: [ F(F(n^{163})) = F(F(n)) + 1. ] 4. **Considering the Prime Omega Function ( omega(n) ):** - The prime omega function ( omega(n) ) counts the number of distinct prime factors of ( n ). We hypothesize that ( F(n) = omega(n) ) might satisfy all conditions. - For ( n = 361 ), we have ( omega(361) = 1 ) since ( 361 = 19^2 ) and 19 is a prime number. 5. **Verification of Conditions:** - **Condition (a):** The function ( omega(n) ) takes all non-negative integer values since any non-negative integer ( k ) can be represented as the number of distinct prime factors of some ( n ). - **Condition (b):** Each positive integer ( k ) occurs infinitely often because there are infinitely many numbers with exactly ( k ) distinct prime factors. - **Condition (c):** We need to verify: [ omega(omega(n^{163})) = omega(omega(n)) + omega(omega(361)). ] Since ( omega(n^{163}) = omega(n) ) (the number of distinct prime factors does not change with exponentiation), we have: [ omega(omega(n)) = omega(omega(n)) + 1, ] which holds true if ( omega(omega(n)) = 0 ).

Let A', B', and C' be the points symmetric to I with respect to the sides of triangle ABC.

That is, A' is the reflection of I over BC, B' is the reflection of I over AC, and C' is the reflection of I over AB. 3. **Define Tangency Points:** Let A_1, B_1, and C_1 be the points where the incircle of triangle ABC touches BC, AC, and AB respectively. By definition, these points are the midpoints of the segments formed by reflecting I across the respective sides, i.e., A_1 is the midpoint of AA', B_1 is the midpoint of BB', and C_1 is the midpoint of CC'. 4. **Equivalency of Triangles:** Using the Midline Theorem, we establish that A_1B_1 parallel A'B', B_1C_1 parallel B'C', and A_1C_1 parallel A'C'. This implies that triangle A_1B_1C_1 is similar to triangle A'B'C' through dilation with a factor of 1/2. 5. **Angle Calculation:** The angles of triangle A_1B_1C_1 are equal to the respective angles in triangle A'B'C'. Denote angle ABC = beta. Since B_1C_1 perp AI and B_1A_1 perp CI, where AI and CI are the angle bisectors of angle BAC and angle BCA respectively, we express angle A'B'C' as angle A_1B_1C_1 which is calculated as follows: [ angle A'B'C' = angle A_1B_1C_1 = 180^circ - angle AIC = 180^circ - left(90^circ + frac{angle BAC + angle BCA}{2}right) ] Since in triangle ABC, angle BAC + angle BCA + angle ABC = 180^circ, we deduce: [ angle A'B'C' = 90^circ - frac{180^circ - angle ABC}{2} = 90^circ - (90^circ - frac{angle ABC}{2}) = frac{angle ABC}{2} ] 6. **Quadrilateral Property:** Since A'B'C' and A'BC' form a cyclic quadrilateral (because the circumcircle of A'B'C' passes through B implying angle A'BC' and angle A'B'C' are supplementary), we have: [ angle A'C'B' + angle A'BC' = 180^circ ] Using the previous result: [ angle A'BC' = 180^circ - angle A'B'C' = 180^circ - frac{angle ABC}{2} ] 7. **Double Angle Argument:** Moreover, since A' and C' are reflections of I across BC and AB, respectively, the angle measures satisfy: [ angle A'BC' = 2angle ABI + 2angle CBI = 2angle ABC ] 8. **Conclusion:** By equating the two expressions for angle A'BC': [ 180^circ - frac{angle ABC}{2} = 2angle ABC ] Solving for angle ABC: [ 180^circ - frac{angle ABC}{2} = 2angle ABC ] Multiply by 2 to clear the fraction: [ 360^circ - angle ABC = 4angle ABC ] Combine like terms: [ 360^circ = 5angle ABC ] Therefore: [ angle ABC = frac{360^circ}{5} = 72^circ ] Hence, the required angle is: [ boxed{60^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Given f(x)=|x^{2}1|+x^{2}+kx.

Therefore, a = 2 and b = sqrt{3}. Hence, the standard equation of the ellipse C_2 is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. (2) (i) If the slope of line l does not exist, then l: x = 1, and points A(1, 2) and B(1, -2) would be on the parabola, so |AB| = 4. Since the perimeter of triangle triangle MF_1F_2 is equal to |MF_1| + |MF_2| + |F_1F_2| = 2a + 2c = 6, which is not equal to |AB|, we conclude that line l must have a defined slope. (ii) Let the slope of line l be k, then l: y = k(x - 1). From the system of equations begin{cases} y^2 = 4x y = k(x - 1)end{cases}, we get the quadratic equation k^2 x^2 - (2k^2 + 4)x + k^2 = 0. Since line l intersects the parabola C_1 at two points A and B, we have the discriminant Delta = [-(2k^2 + 4)]^2 - 4k^4 = 16k^2 + 16 > 0 and k neq 0. Let x_1 and x_2 be the roots of the quadratic equation, we have x_1 + x_2 = frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} and x_1 x_2 = 1. Therefore, |AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2} |x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{(1 + k^2)[(x_1 + x_2)^2 - 4x_1 x_2]} = sqrt{(1 + k^2)left[left(2 + frac{4}{k^2}right)^2 - 4right]} = sqrt{(1 + k^2)left(frac{16}{k^2} + frac{16}{k^4}right)} = frac{4(1 + k^2)}{k^2}. Since the perimeter of triangle triangle MF_1F_2 is |MF_1| + |MF_2| + |F_1F_2| = 2a + 2c = 6, by the equation frac{4(1 + k^2)}{k^2} = 6 we find k = pm sqrt{2}.

According to the problem, James buys half as much pork as beef, so P = B/2. James uses 1.5 pounds of meat to make each meal. Since he made 400 and each meal sells for 20, we can calculate the number of meals he sold by dividing the total sales by the price per meal: Number of meals sold = Total sales / Price per meal Number of meals sold = 400 / 20 Number of meals sold = 20 meals Since each meal uses 1.5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the total amount of meat used for the 20 meals: Total meat used = Number of meals sold * Meat per meal Total meat used = 20 meals * 1.5 pounds/meal Total meat used = 30 pounds This total meat used includes both beef and pork. Since the pork is half the amount of beef, we can set up the equation: B + P = 30 pounds B + (B/2) = 30 pounds Now, let's solve for B: 1.5B = 30 pounds B = 30 pounds / 1.5 B = 20 pounds James bought boxed{20} pounds of beef."},{"instruction":"ertain characteristic in a large population has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean m . if 68 % of the distribution lies one standard deviation g of the mean , what percent of the distribution is less than m + g ?","output":"The distribution described is symmetric about the mean, and it follows the empirical rule, which is often associated with the normal distribution. According to the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule): - Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation (g) of the mean (m). - Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. - Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean. Since the distribution is symmetric about the mean, the 68% of the data that falls within one standard deviation of the mean is evenly distributed around the mean. This means that: - 34% of the data falls between the mean (m) and one standard deviation above the mean (m + g). - 34% of the data falls between the mean (m) and one standard deviation below the mean (m - g). Therefore, if we want to find the percentage of the distribution that is less than m + g, we need to add the 34% that lies between m and m + g to the 50% of the data that lies below the mean (since the distribution is symmetric, half of the data is below the mean and half is above it). So, the percentage of the distribution that is less than m + g is: 50% (below the mean) + 34% (between the mean and m + g) = 84% Thus, boxed{84%} of the distribution is less than m + g."},{"instruction":"x is the product of each integer from 1 to 50, inclusive and y = 100 ^ k, where k is an integer.

Since 100 is ( 2^2 times 5^2 ), we need to count the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of ( x ) (the product of each integer from 1 to 50). The number of 2s in the prime factorization of ( x ) will be much higher than the number of 5s because every even number contributes at least one factor of 2. Therefore, the limiting factor will be the number of 5s, as every multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5. Let's count the number of 5s in the prime factorization of ( x ): - There are ( leftlfloor frac{50}{5} rightrfloor = 10 ) multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. - Among these, there are ( leftlfloor frac{50}{25} rightrfloor = 2 ) multiples of 25, which contribute an extra factor of 5 each (since 25 is ( 5^2 )). So, the total number of 5s in the prime factorization of ( x ) is ( 10 + 2 = 12 ). Since we need two 5s to make a 100 (along with two 2s, which we have in abundance), the greatest value of ( k ) for which ( 100^k ) is a factor of ( x ) is ( leftlfloor frac{12}{2} rightrfloor = 6 ).

The equation of a circle in the plane is given by: [ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 ] where (h, k) is the center of the circle and r is its radius. The graph of y = sin x is a sinusoidal wave oscillating between -1 and 1 with a period of 2pi. Step 1: Substitute y = sin x into the circle equation Substituting y = sin x into the circle equation, we get: [ (x - h)^2 + (sin x - k)^2 = r^2 ] This equation represents the condition for the points (x, sin x) on the graph of y = sin x to lie on the circle. Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the equation The equation (x - h)^2 + (sin x - k)^2 = r^2 is not straightforward to solve algebraically due to the sinusoidal term. However, we can analyze it graphically and conceptually. The key observation is that as the radius r increases, the circle can encompass more oscillations of the sine wave. Step 3: Consider the limit as the radius becomes very large As the radius r becomes very large, the circle's curvature becomes flatter near the x-axis, approaching the line y = k. If k is chosen such that -1 leq k leq 1, the circle will intersect the sine wave near every peak and trough as x increases. Step 4: Infinite intersections For a sufficiently large r, and with k within the range of the sine function, the circle will intersect the sine wave near every peak and trough. Since the sine function has an infinite number of peaks and troughs as x to pminfty, the circle can intersect the sine wave infinitely many times. Conclusion: Given that the circle can be made to intersect the sine wave infinitely many times by choosing a sufficiently large radius and appropriate center, the correct answer is that a circle can intersect the graph of y = sin x more than 16 times.

The score of the partition is given by: [ text{Score} = frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n}{n} ] We aim to find the minimum possible value of this score. 1. **Initial Observation**: The average of the entire set ( S ) is: [ text{Average of } S = frac{1 + 2 + ldots + 100}{100} = frac{100 cdot 101 / 2}{100} = 50.5 ] However, we are interested in the average of the averages of the subsets ( S_i ). 2. **Partition Strategy**: Consider the partition ( {1}, {2}, ldots, {9}, {10, 11, ldots, 100} ).

If there exists indices ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( |S_i| < |S_j| ), and there exist ( k in S_i ), ( l in S_j ), ( k > l ), then swapping ( k ) and ( l ) decreases the sum of the averages, making the partition suboptimal.

Let's call this angle alpha_E. - The same rule applies to the segment BD for the second circle, where F is the intersection point of two circles. The angle subtended is noted alpha_F. 4. **Relationship between angles**: Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals: - In cyclic quadrilaterals (those that can be drawn inside a circle), opposite angles add up to 180^circ. - Therefore, if E is another intersection point of the circles, the angle sum property implies angle AEC + angle AEB = 180^circ. - Similarly for BD, it must therefore hold angle BFD + angle BFC = 180^circ. 5. **Conclusion**: Since point view for segments AC and BD from intersection points have identical relationships in measure to their circles, these segments AC (or AD) and BD (or BC) simply are either viewed under the same measure or supplementary measure consistently by nature of being inscribed in circles crossing points.

This step might be implicitly referring to the determination of something specific about the lines which might be detailed in problem 78830. Part b) We need to demonstrate that if n geq 3 lines are drawn on a plane, the number of triangles formed by these lines is at least (frac{2n - 2}{3}). 1. **Calculate the number of intersection points:** - Since none of the lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent, each pair of lines intersects exactly once. - The formula for the number of intersection points of (n) lines is given by: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] 2. **Calculate the number of regions:** - When (n) lines are drawn such that no two are parallel and no three are concurrent, the plane is divided into: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} + frac{n}{2} + 1 ] regions. This can be derived from geometric combinatorics principles about the arrangement of lines. 3. **Calculate the number of triangles:** - Each set of 3 intersection points contributes to a unique triangle in the arrangement. - However, not all sets of 3 points form triangles as some might be collinear depending on their connection through the lines. To count only the triangles correctly, we need to select among the intersection points that only form bounded regions, which are essentially triangles.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x, we obtain: f'(x) = -f'(frac{pi}{4}) sin x + cos x Step 2: Find the derivative at x = frac{pi}{4}. Substitute x = frac{pi}{4} into f'(x): f'(frac{pi}{4}) = -f'(frac{pi}{4}) sin frac{pi}{4} + cos frac{pi}{4} Since sin frac{pi}{4} = cos frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have: f'(frac{pi}{4}) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}f'(frac{pi}{4}) + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} Step 3: Solve for f'(frac{pi}{4}). Rearranging the equation, we find: f'(frac{pi}{4}) + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}f'(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} f'(frac{pi}{4})(1 + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} f'(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2 + sqrt{2}} Rationalize the denominator: f'(frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}(2 - sqrt{2})}{(2 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})} = sqrt{2} - 1 Step 4: Find the value of f(frac{pi}{4}). Now, substitute x = frac{pi}{4} back into the original function, f(x) = f'(frac{pi}{4}) cos x + sin x: f(frac{pi}{4}) = (sqrt{2} - 1)cos frac{pi}{4} + sin frac{pi}{4} f(frac{pi}{4}) = (sqrt{2} - 1)frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} f(frac{pi}{4}) = 1 Therefore, the value of f(frac{pi}{4}) is boxed{1}."},{"instruction":"Which of the following operations is correct?

We need to prove that every positive integer appears in the sequence {a_n}. 1. **Base Case for (k=1):** Consider an integer (m) that is a power of a prime (p), i.e., (m = p^alpha) where (alpha > 0). - Suppose (m) does not appear in the sequence ({a_n}). - Since all terms in ({a_n}) are distinct, there exists a positive integer (N) such that for (n geq N), (a_n > p^alpha). - If there exists (n geq N) such that (p nmid S_n) where (S_n = sum_{i=1}^n a_i), then (p^alpha) is coprime with (S_n). Given that (a_{n+1}) must be less than or equal to (p^alpha) (by definition of the sequence), this implies (a_{n+1} leq p^alpha), a contradiction since we assumed (a_{n+1} > p^alpha). - Therefore, for every (n geq N), we must have (p mid S_n). Using (p mid S_n) and (p mid S_{n+1} Rightarrow p mid a_{n+1}), leading to (a_{n+1}) not being coprime with (S_{n+1}), which contradicts the definition of (a_{n+1}). Hence, (p^alpha) must appear in the sequence ({a_n}). 2. **Induction Step: General Case for (k geq 2):** - Assume any integer (m) with (k-1) distinct prime factors appears in the sequence ({a_n}). - Consider (m = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k}) where (k) prime factors are involved. Suppose (m) does not appear in ({a_n}). - There exists (N') such that for (n geq N'), (a_n > m). - Choose sufficiently large positive integers (beta_1, beta_2, ldots, beta_{k-1}) such that (M = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} cdots p_{k-1}^{beta_{k-1}} > max_{1 leq n leq N'} a_n). We need to show (a_{n+1} neq M) for (n > N'): If (S_n) (the sum of the first (n) terms) is coprime with (p_1 p_2 cdots p_k), then (m) is coprime with (S_n), contradicting the minimum value condition for (a_{n+1}). Thus, for any (n > N'), (S_n) is not coprime with (p_1 p_2 cdots p_k). **Case Analysis**: - If there exists (i) (where (1 leq i leq k-1)) such that (p_i mid S_n): - Since ((a_{n+1}, S_n) = 1), (p_i nmid a_{n+1}) and (p_i mid M), implying (a_{n+1} neq M). - If (p_i nmid S_n) for all (i) (where (1 leq i leq k-1)): - Since (p_k mid S_n) and (p_k nmid a_{n+1}), then (p_k nmid S_{n+1}). Moreover, there exists some (i_0) such that (p_{i_0} mid S_{n+1}), forcing (a_{n+1} neq M). Consequently, (a_{n+1} neq M) for (n geq N'+1) and thus (M) does not appear in ({a_n}). By induction, any integer (m) with (k) distinct prime factors must appear in the sequence ({a_n}). 3. **Conclusion:** Since the result follows for integers with one or more prime factors, by the principle of mathematical induction, every positive integer must appear in the sequence ({a_n}). Thus, every positive integer indeed appears in the sequence {a_n}.

What percent of the purchase price, to the nearest tenth of a percent, did the customer pay in interest by using this plan?","output":"To find the percent of the purchase price paid in interest, we first need to calculate the total interest paid over the 18 months. The initial balance after the down payment is 130 - 30 = 100. Since the interest compounds monthly at a rate of 1.5%, we can use the formula for the compound interest to find the total amount paid after 18 months: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) Where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money before interest). r = the annual interest rate (in decimal). n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year. t = the time the money is invested for, in years. In this case: P = 100 r = 1.5% per month = 0.015 n = 1 (since it compounds monthly) t = 18/12 years (since we're looking at 18 months) A = 100(1 + 0.015/1)^(1*(18/12)) A = 100(1 + 0.015)^(1.5) A = 100(1.015)^1.5 Now we calculate the value of (1.015)^1.5: A = 100 * (1.015)^1.5 Using a calculator, we find: (1.015)^1.5 ≈ 1.022837 So: A ≈ 100 * 1.022837 A ≈ 102.2837 The total amount after 18 months is approximately 102.2837. The interest paid is the total amount minus the principal: Interest = A - P Interest ≈ 102.2837 - 100 Interest ≈ 2.2837 To find the percent of the purchase price paid in interest, we divide the interest by the purchase price and multiply by 100: Percent of purchase price in interest = (Interest / Purchase Price) * 100 Percent of purchase price in interest ≈ (2.2837 / 130) * 100 Percent of purchase price in interest ≈ (0.017567) * 100 Percent of purchase price in interest ≈ 1.7567% Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, the customer paid approximately boxed{1.8%} of the purchase price in interest by using this plan."},{"instruction":"Olivia earns 9 per hour.

We claim that the answer is (2n - 6) for any (n)-gon. We will prove this bound and its constructability through strong induction. 1. **Base Case:** - For (n = 3) (a triangle), there are no diagonals, so the number of diagonals is (0), which satisfies (2 cdot 3 - 6 = 0). - For (n = 4) (a quadrilateral), there are (2) diagonals, which satisfies (2 cdot 4 - 6 = 2). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - Assume that for any (k)-gon where (3 leq k leq n-1), the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn such that each newly drawn diagonal intersects no more than one of the already drawn diagonals is (2k - 6). 3. **Inductive Step:** - Consider an (n)-gon. We need to show that the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn is (2n - 6). - The last diagonal drawn divides the (n)-gon into an (m)-gon and a ((n+2-m))-gon. This final diagonal must intersect with at most one other diagonal. - By the inductive hypothesis, the maximum number of diagonals in the (m)-gon is (2m - 6), and the maximum number of diagonals in the ((n+2-m))-gon is (2(n+2-m) - 6). - Therefore, the total number of diagonals is: [ (2m - 6) + (2(n+2-m) - 6) + 1 = 2m - 6 + 2n - 4 - 2m + 1 - 6 = 2n - 6 ] The \\"+1\\" term accounts for the final diagonal that intersects with at most one other diagonal. 4. **Constructability:** - To achieve this bound, consider four consecutive vertices (A, B, C, D) in the (n)-gon. Draw the diagonal (AC) as the final diagonal and (BD) as the only diagonal crossing (AC). - This leaves us with two smaller polygons: one with (m) vertices and the other with (n+2-m) vertices. - By the inductive hypothesis, we can draw (2(m-1) - 6) diagonals in the (m)-gon and (2((n+2-m)-1) - 6) diagonals in the ((n+2-m))-gon. - Adding these diagonals and the final diagonal (AC), we get: [ 2(m-1) - 6 + 2((n+2-m)-1) - 6 + 1 = 2n - 6 ] - Thus, the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn in an (n)-gon is (2n - 6).

For the array to be tame, for each ( 1 leq i leq 13 ), the sum of the remaining 12 elements must be even. This means ( S - a_i ) must be even for all ( i ). 3. Since ( S - a_i ) is even, ( S ) and ( a_i ) must have the same parity (both even or both odd). 4. Therefore, ( S ) must be even if all ( a_i ) are even, and ( S ) must be odd if all ( a_i ) are odd. 5. Hence, all ( a_i ) must have the same parity. (blacksquare) # Part (c) 1. Consider a turbo tame array where the remaining 12 numbers can always be divided into two groups of six numbers having the same sum. 2. Let ( S = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{13} ). 3. For the array to be turbo tame, for each ( 1 leq i leq 13 ), the sum of the remaining 12 elements must be divisible by 2 and must be able to be split into two equal groups. 4. This implies that the sum of the remaining 12 elements, ( S - a_i ), must be even and divisible by 2. 5. Since ( S - a_i ) is even, ( S ) and ( a_i ) must have the same parity. 6. Additionally, for the remaining 12 elements to be split into two groups of six with equal sums, the sum of the remaining 12 elements must be divisible by 2. 7. This implies that ( S - a_i ) must be divisible by 2 for all ( i ), and thus ( S ) must be divisible by 2. 8. Since ( S ) is divisible by 2 and all ( a_i ) have the same parity, all ( a_i ) must be equal for the array to be turbo tame.

We are given that f(x) is an odd function, which implies that g(x) is an even function because the product of an odd function (f(x)) and the odd function x^3 results in an even function. For x > 0, we are given that 3f(x) + xf'(x) > 0. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by x^2 (which is positive for x > 0 and thus does not change the direction of the inequality), we get: [3x^2f(x) + x^3f'(x) > 0.] This can be rewritten as: [g'(x) > 0,] since g(x) = x^3f(x) implies g'(x) = 3x^2f(x) + x^3f'(x) by the product rule of differentiation. Given that g(x) is an even function, it has the property of being symmetric about the y-axis. This means that if g(x) is strictly increasing for x > 0, it must be strictly decreasing for x < 0.

Therefore, for f(x) > 0, we need g(x) < 0 when x < 0 and g(x) > 0 when x > 0. However, since f(x) is an odd function, f(x) > 0 for x < 0 contradicts the nature of odd functions (which are symmetric about the origin).

Let the altitudes intersect at the orthocenter ( H ). 2. **Incircle and Altitudes:**    In an isosceles triangle, the altitudes from the two equal sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) are also medians and angle bisectors. Therefore, the orthocenter ( H ), which is the intersection point of the altitudes, lies on the line of symmetry of the triangle. 3. **Relations to Area and Radius:**    In an isosceles triangle, the symmetry axis will intersect the base ( BC ) at its midpoint ( D ).

One interesting case satisfying this condition is the 3:3:4 ratio.

We know that the community center sold 35 adult tickets, so the total revenue from adult tickets is ( 35A ). The number of children's tickets sold would be the total tickets sold minus the adult tickets sold, which is ( 85 - 35 = 50 ). Since children's tickets are priced at 2 each, the total revenue from children's tickets is ( 50 times 2 = 100 ). The total revenue collected from both adult and children's tickets is 275. So, we can set up the equation: ( 35A + 100 = 275 ) Now, we solve for ( A ): ( 35A = 275 - 100 ) ( 35A = 175 ) ( A = frac{175}{35} ) ( A = 5 ) Therefore, the cost of an adult ticket is boxed{5} ."},{"instruction":"The total distance between 2 towns is 200 miles.

Since they drove 1/4 of the total distance, we have: Distance before lunch = 1/4 * 200 miles = 50 miles They took 1 hour to drive this distance, so their speed was 50 miles per hour. Now, let's find out the remaining distance they had to drive after lunch: Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance before lunch Remaining distance = 200 miles - 50 miles = 150 miles Since they continued at the same speed of 50 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took to drive the remaining distance: Time to drive remaining distance = Remaining distance / Speed Time to drive remaining distance = 150 miles / 50 miles per hour = 3 hours Finally, let's add the time taken for lunch to the total driving time: Total driving time = Time before lunch + Time after lunch Total driving time = 1 hour (before lunch) + 3 hours (after lunch) = 4 hours Adding the 1 hour they took for lunch: Total time = Total driving time + Lunch time Total time = 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours So, the total amount of time Roger and his friend took to travel between the two towns is boxed{5}  hours."},{"instruction":"Calculate how many positive divisors 7!

Since we need three consecutive primes greater than 3, none of ( p, q, ) and ( r ) is divisible by 3.    - It is known that the square of any integer not divisible by 3, when divided by 3, leaves a remainder of 1 (as can be derived from quadratic residues theorem).    - Hence,      [      p^2 equiv 1 mod 3, quad q^2 equiv 1 mod 3, quad r^2 equiv 1 mod 3      ]    - Summing these congruences:      [      p^2 + q^2 + r^2 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 equiv 0 mod 3      ]    - Therefore, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) would be divisible by 3. The only prime number divisible by 3 is 3 itself. However, for all ( p, q, r > 3 ), their sum of squares is significantly larger than 3, so it cannot be a prime number.

First, let's understand the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean. The mean of X is 2. Therefore, the probability of X being in an interval of equal length on either side of the mean is the same. This means that P(2 < X < 4) is equal to P(0 < X < 2) due to the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean. Given P(X geq 4) = 0.2, we can also infer that P(X < 4) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. This probability includes the entire area under the normal curve to the left of X = 4.  Since the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, the area between X = 2 and X = 4 (which is P(2 < X < 4)) is half of the area to the left of X = 4 (which is P(X < 4)) minus the area to the left of the mean (X = 2). Therefore, we have: [P(2 < X < 4) = frac{P(X < 4) - P(X < 2)}{2}] Given that P(X < 4) = 0.8 and knowing that P(X < 2) is the complement of P(X geq 2), which is 0.5 because X = 2 is the mean of the distribution, we find: [P(2 < X < 4) = frac{0.8 - 0.5}{2} = frac{0.3}{2} = 0.15] However, the correct approach to find P(2 < X < 4) directly relates to the given P(X geq 4) = 0.2 and the symmetry of the normal distribution. Since P(X geq 4) = 0.2, the area to the right of X = 4 is 0.2, and the area between X = 2 and X = 4 is the remaining area in the upper half of the distribution, which is 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3 due to the symmetry of the distribution.

Using properties of the angle bisector:      [      frac{CX}{BX} = frac{AC}{AB}      ]      - Since (AC > AB), we have (CX > BX). 8. **Comparing (M) and (X):**    - (M) (the midpoint of (BC)) will divide (CX).

First, observe that:    [    a_{n+1} = 3a_n - 2mathrm{c}(a_n)    ]    Since ( mathrm{c}(a_n) leq a_n ), we have:    [    a_{n+1} geq 3a_n - 2a_n = a_n    ]    This implies that the sequence is non-decreasing. 3. **Condition for Boundedness:**    For the sequence to be bounded, it must eventually become constant. This means there exists some ( N ) such that ( a_{N+1} = a_N ). If ( a_{n+1} = a_n ), then:    [    3a_n - 2mathrm{c}(a_n) = a_n    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    2a_n = 2mathrm{c}(a_n) implies a_n = mathrm{c}(a_n)    ]    Therefore, ( a_n ) must be a perfect cube. 4. **Perfect Cube Condition:**    Suppose ( a_k ) is a perfect cube, say ( a_k = m^3 ). Then:    [    a_{k+1} = 3a_k - 2mathrm{c}(a_k) = 3m^3 - 2m^3 = m^3    ]    This implies that if ( a_k ) is a perfect cube, then ( a_{k+1} ) is also a perfect cube. 5. **Backward Induction:**    Suppose ( a_k = m^3 ) for some ( k ).

Thus, ( l_4 = T ). 2. **Recursive Definition**:    - For ( k > 4 ), the first player can guarantee a win if at least one of ( l_{k-1} ), ( l_{k-3} ), or ( l_{k-4} ) is false. This is because the first player can force the second player into a losing position by removing 1, 3, or 4 sticks respectively.    - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:      [      l_k = neg (l_{k-1} wedge l_{k-3} wedge l_{k-4})      ]      where ( wedge ) is the logical AND and ( neg ) is the logical NOT. 3. **Pattern Identification**:    - By calculating the values of ( l_k ) for ( k ) from 1 to 14, we observe the following pattern:      [      begin{align*}      l_1 & = T       l_2 & = F       l_3 & = T       l_4 & = T       l_5 & = T       l_6 & = T       l_7 & = F       l_8 & = T       l_9 & = F       l_{10} & = T       l_{11} & = T       l_{12} & = T       l_{13} & = T       l_{14} & = F       end{align*}      ]    - We notice that the losing positions (F) occur at ( k = 2, 7, 9, 14, ldots ). These positions are either ( 0 ) or ( 2 ) modulo 7. 4. **Generalization**:    - Since ( l_k ) depends only on ( l_{k-1} ), ( l_{k-3} ), and ( l_{k-4} ), the pattern repeats every 7 numbers.    - Therefore, for every block of 7 numbers, there are 5 winning positions and 2 losing positions. 5. **Counting Winning Positions**:    - From ( k = 1 ) to ( k = 98 ), there are ( 14 ) blocks of 7 numbers. Each block has 5 winning positions.      [      14 times 5 = 70      ]    - For ( k = 99 ), it is a winning position.    - For ( k = 100 ), it is a losing position (since ( 100 equiv 2 mod 7 )). 6. **Total Winning Positions**:    - Adding the winning positions from ( 1 ) to ( 98 ) and the winning position at ( 99 ):      [      70 + 1 = 71      ] The final answer is (boxed{71})"},{"instruction":"Calculate the following expressions: (1)(5 frac{1}{16})^{0.5}+(1)^{1}div0.75^{2}+(2 frac{10}{27})^{ frac{2}{3}} ;; (2)log_{3} sqrt{27}+log 25+log 4+7^{log_{2}2}+(9.8)^{0} ;.","output":"(1) First, let's convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions and simplify the exponents: left(5 frac{1}{16}right)^{0.5} = left(frac{81}{16}right)^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{9}{4}, (-1)^{-1} = 1, 0.75^{-2} = left(frac{4}{3}right)^{2} = frac{16}{9}, left(2 frac{10}{27}right)^{frac{2}{3}} = left(frac{27}{64}right)^{frac{2}{3}} = frac{9}{16}.

The rule governing the sequence is: - If the last number written is even, divide it by 2 and add 2. - If the last number written is odd, multiply it by 2 and subtract 2.  Step-by-Step Construction: 1. The first number is 130. Since 130 is even, we set:     [     130 to left(frac{130}{2} + 2right) = 67 + 2 = 132     ]      2. The second number is 67. Since 67 is odd, we set:     [     67 to (67 times 2 - 2) = 134 - 2 = 132     ] 3. The third number is 132. Since 132 is even, we set:     [     132 to left(frac{132}{2} + 2right) = 66 + 2 = 68     ] 4. The fourth number is 68. Since 68 is even, we set:     [     68 to left(frac{68}{2} + 2right) = 34 + 2 = 36     ] 5. The fifth number is 36. Since 36 is even, we set:     [     36 to left(frac{36}{2} + 2right) = 18 + 2 = 20     ] 6. The sixth number is 20. Since 20 is even, we set:     [     20 to left(frac{20}{2} + 2right) = 10 + 2 = 12     ] 7. The seventh number is 12. Since 12 is even, we set:     [     12 to left(frac{12}{2} + 2right) = 6 + 2 = 8     ] 8. The eighth number is 8. Since 8 is even, we set:     [     8 to left(frac{8}{2} + 2right) = 4 + 2 = 6     ] 9. The ninth number is 6. Since 6 is even, we set:     [     6 to left(frac{6}{2} + 2right) = 3 + 2 = 5     ]      10. The tenth number is 5. Since 5 is odd, we set:     [     5 to (5 times 2 - 2) = 10 - 2 = 8     ] From here we observe the sequence starts repeating after the number 8. Thus, the repeating cycle is 8, 6, 5.   Finding the 2016th number: The sequence starts cycling after the initial 7 terms. Therefore, we need the 2009th number in the cycle (2016 - 7 = 2009 from the start of the cycle). The cycle length is 3 because it contains the sequence 8, 6, 5. Therefore, we calculate: [ 2009 mod 3 = 2 ] This tells us that the 2009th element in the cycle corresponds to the second number in the cycle 8, 6, 5, which is 6. # Conclusion: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"instruction":"John used frac{5}{12} of a roll of wrapping paper to wrap six presents.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining allowance on snacks, which is 0.25 * 0.60A = 0.15A. After buying snacks, the remaining allowance is 0.60A - 0.15A = 0.45A.

Consider the positive integers x, y, p, n, k that satisfy the equation ( x^n + y^n = p^k ), where ( n ) is an odd integer greater than 1 and ( p ) is an odd prime number. 1.

To determine the behavior of f(x), we look at the sign of f'(x): - For f'(x) > 0, we solve e^x - 1 > 0, which gives us x > 0. - For f'(x) < 0, we solve e^x - 1 < 0, which gives us x < 0. 1.3.

Since the line y=2x-4 is given to pass through the point F (the right focus of the hyperbola) and intersects the hyperbola at only one point, we conclude that the line y=2x-4 must be parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The slope of the line, therefore, should be equal to the slope of the asymptote. 2. The equation of the asymptotes of the given hyperbola is generally y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Since the slope of the asymptote must match the slope of the given line, which is 2, we have:        frac{b}{a} = 2     3. Plugging in y=0 in the line equation y=2x-4, we find x=2.

Step 3: Use the property of a rhombus that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles to find the length of a side. Let's denote the diagonals as d_1 = 2 and d_2 = 1.

However, the solution mentions a specific condition where a=0. If a=0, the equation becomes linear (bx+c=0) rather than quadratic. Despite this, the general form without considering a=0 directly represents a quadratic equation. The confusion arises from considering a specific case rather than the general form. Thus, while the explanation might seem to disqualify it, the form ax^{2}+bx+c=0 is indeed the general form of a quadratic equation. - **Option B**: frac{1}{{x^2}}+frac{1}{x}=2 This equation is not in the standard quadratic form due to the presence of x in the denominator. However, it can be transformed into a quadratic equation by multiplying through by x^2 (assuming x neq 0), leading to 1 + x = 2x^2.

(2) Let's choose y=-x, and substitute into the functional equation: f(x + (-x)) = f(x) + f(-x). Since we know f(0) = 0, we have: f(0) = f(x) + f(-x). Thus, f(-x) = -f(x).

To analyze the monotonicity of the function, let's consider x_1 < x_2 such that x_2 = x_1 + t, where t > 0. Using the functional equation again, we have: f(x_2) = f(x_1) + f(t).

We need to find the number of 5-digit positive integers such that each of its digits, except for the last one, is greater than or equal to the next digit. Let the 5-digit number be represented as (abcde), where (a, b, c, d, e) are its digits. 2. The condition given is that each digit, except for the last one, is greater than or equal to the next digit. This can be written as:    [    a geq b geq c geq d geq e    ]    where (a, b, c, d, e) are digits from 0 to 9. 3. To simplify the problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to count the number of non-increasing sequences of length 5 where each digit is between 0 and 9. 4. We can transform the problem into a problem of distributing indistinguishable objects (stars) into distinguishable bins (digits). This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation:    [    x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 9    ]    where (x_i) represents the number of times digit (i) appears in the sequence, and (x_i geq 0). 5. The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is given by the stars and bars theorem, which states that the number of solutions to the equation (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_k = n) is:    [    binom{n+k-1}{k-1}    ]    In our case, (n = 9) and (k = 5), so we need to find:    [    binom{9+5-1}{5-1} = binom{13}{4}    ] 6.

Therefore, when a=0, the inequality holds for all real numbers x. 2. **Case 2: a neq 0** When a is not zero, to ensure the quadratic inequality ax^{2}-2ax+1 > 0 always holds, the quadratic must not have real roots, and it must open upwards. This yields two conditions: - The coefficient of x^2 must be positive, implying a > 0. - The discriminant Delta of the quadratic must be less than 0 for it not to have real roots.  The discriminant Delta is given by: [Delta = b^2-4ac = (-2a)^2-4(a)(1) = 4a^2-4a] Setting Delta < 0 to ensure no real roots, we have: [4a^2-4a < 0] [a(a-1) < 0] This inequality holds for 0 < a < 1.

The net increase in population per day is given as 86,400 people. There are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds). Therefore, the net increase in population per second is: Net increase per second = Net increase per day / Number of seconds in a day Net increase per second = 86,400 people / 86,400 seconds Net increase per second = 1 person per second Now, we know the birth rate is 4 people every two seconds, which is equivalent to 2 people per second. To maintain a net increase of 1 person per second, the death rate must be such that when subtracted from the birth rate, the result is the net increase. Let's denote the death rate as D people per second. The equation for the net increase per second is: Birth rate per second - Death rate per second = Net increase per second 2 people per second - D people per second = 1 person per second Solving for D: 2 - D = 1 D = 2 - 1 D = 1 person per second Therefore, the average death rate in the city is 1 person per second.

Since (widehat{SEB} = 2 times widehat{AEB}), and substituting in the equivalence:    [    widehat{SEB} = 2 times (180^circ - widehat{ADC})    ] 7.

We shall proceed by considering two cases: 1. (k) is odd. 2. (k) is even.  Case 1: (k) is odd Let's denote our number as (N). If (k) is odd, note the periodic structure of (N): it can be expressed as (N = 101 cdot 10^{k-1} + 101).

Case 2: (k) is even When (k) is even, consider again our number (N). Let's multiply (N) by 11: [ 11 cdot N = 11 cdot (10^{k+1} + 1) = 10^{k+2} + 10 - (10 + 1) = 11 cdot 10^{k+1} + 11 - 1 = 11 cdot 10^{k+1}.] This forms a repunit number (A) which is a sequence of (k + 1) ones: [ A = 111 ldots 1 , (k+1 text{ ones}).] By construction, (A) does not share common factors with (11), suggesting that our original number (N) is divisible by this repunit number (A). Consequently, [ N = frac{10^{k+1} + 1}{11} cdot A.] Given that both (11) and (A) are greater than 1 when (k > 1), (N) is again shown to be composite. # Conclusion: The number (1010 ldots 0101) with (k+1) digits is composite for any natural number (k > 1).

Because both numbers (a) and (b) are permutations of the digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), subtracting one from the other will yield a number (a - b) that consists of such digits. Consequently, the difference can have a few particular properties:    - It has digits ranging from -6 to 6, but since absolute magnitude is considered, the positive counterparts are observed.    - The value (|a - b|) can vary under permutations but is ultimately bounded by these constraints.    5. Additionally, note that the digits summed up (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 ), indicating that any such permutation sum yields 28 (mod 9). 6. Therefore, let's contest that (frac{a - b}{b}) is an integer lesser than or equal to 7:   [   frac{a - b}{b} leqslant 7   ]   The above implies (frac{a - b}{b} leq 7) because the absolute difference (a - b) is a bounded value regarding the divisors of digits. 7. On the other hand, (a - b) is divisible by 9 because it reorders all distinct digits adding to multiples of 9, i.e.,:   [   a - b equiv 0 pmod{9}   ]   However, (b) is not divisible by 9. Any number formed by these digits will not be, reiterating that:   [   b nmid 9   ] 8. Therefore, (frac{a-b}{b}) would essentially relate to divisibility by 9 conditions, contradicting values between (a) and (b):    [    frac{a - b}{b} = k cdot 9 leq 7    ]    This discrepancy concludes that no such (a) and (b) could exist, preserving uniqueness in those numbers. # Conclusion: [ boxed{None of the 7-digit numbers composed using digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 can divide another distinct 7-digit number made from these digits} ]"},{"instruction":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be two positive integers whose least common multiple is 232848.

In total, we have ( 10 ) lines. 2. **Assume the contrary:**    Assume that each of the ( 10 ) lines cuts a domino.  3. **Observation 1:**    Each domino can be cut at most by one line. This is because a ( 2 times 1 ) domino can only be intersected by one line at a time. 4. **Observation 2:**    Whenever a line cuts the board, it divides the board into two parts. Each part will have dimensions ( 6 times k ) (or ( k times 6 )), where ( k ) is an integer. Each part contains an even number of cells, specifically ( 6k ) cells. 5. **Observation 3:**    A line should cut an even number of dominoes. If a line cuts an odd number of dominoes, the parts on either side of the line will have an odd number of cells, as they have ( 6k ) cells with an odd number of cells removed. However, such parts cannot be tiled with ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes because an odd number of cells cannot be completely covered by ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes. 6. **Observation 4:**    Therefore, each line must cut at least two dominoes. Since we have ( 10 ) lines, at least ( 10 times 2 = 20 ) distinct dominoes are cut by the ( 10 ) lines. 7. **Contradiction:**    The board contains ( 6 times 6 = 36 ) cells, which means there are ( frac{36}{2} = 18 ) dominoes on the board. However, for ( 20 ) dominoes to be cut, we would need ( 20 times 2 = 40 ) cells. This is a contradiction because the board only has ( 36 ) cells. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, it is possible to cut the board into two parts by a straight line that does not cut any domino. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"A petri dish originally contained some bacteria.

The solution involves the concept of centroids, medians, and areas in triangles. 1. **Draw Medians and Midpoints:**    - To solve this problem, we first draw the medians of triangle (ABC), which connect each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. These medians intersect each other at the centroid of the triangle, which divides each median into a (2:1) ratio (the segment connecting the vertex to the centroid is twice as long as the segment connecting the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side).     2. **Creating Sub-triangles:**    - Let's denotate the midpoints of the sides (AB), (BC), and (CA) as (C_1), (A_1), and (B_1) respectively.         - Median (AA_1) divides (BC) into half and meets it at point (A_1).         - Median (BB_1) divides (AC) into half and meets it at point (B_1).         - Median (CC_1) divides (AB) into half and meets it at point (C_1).     - Now, consider the sub-triangle (A_1BC_1).      3. **Understanding Area Conditions:**    - For one of the triangles, say (ABM), to have an area greater than the sum of the areas of the other two triangles ((BCM) and (CAM)), the point (M) must lie within a specific region.    - Specifically, for the area of triangle (ACM) to be greater than half the area of triangle (ABC), point (M) must lie within the triangle (A_1BC_1). 4. **Probability Considerations:**    - Since the three smaller triangles created by the medians have equal areas and triangle (A_1BC_1) is one among them, the probability of (M) lying in (A_1BC_1) or any of the other similar regions is symmetrical.     - Thus, there are three such equal possibilities for each vertex.     5. **Summing Probabilities:**    - Each of the regions (A_1BC_1), (A_1CB_1), and (B_1AC_1) corresponds to one of the vertices being chosen. This results in a total probability summed up for three cases.     - Each of these regions represents (frac{1}{4}) of the total area.

Since C_n is increasing, we have:    [ C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n geq C_n ]    Therefore,    [ (C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n)^{alpha} geq C_n^{alpha} ] 6. **Combining the results:**    Using the bounds from steps 4 and 5, we get:    [ frac{C_1^{alpha} + C_2^{alpha} + cdots + C_n^{alpha}}{(C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n)^{alpha}} leq frac{n cdot C_n^{alpha}}{C_n^{alpha}} = n cdot frac{C_n^{alpha}}{C_n^{alpha}} = n ] 7. **Taking the limit:**    As n to infty, the right-hand side n to infty. However, we need to consider the behavior of the fraction more carefully. Since C_n to infty and C_n leq n, we have:    [ frac{C_1^{alpha} + C_2^{alpha} + cdots + C_n^{alpha}}{(C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n)^{alpha}} leq frac{n cdot C_n^{alpha}}{C_n^{alpha}} = n cdot frac{C_n^{alpha}}{C_n^{alpha}} = n ]    However, since C_n to infty, the fraction frac{C_1^{alpha} + C_2^{alpha} + cdots + C_n^{alpha}}{(C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n)^{alpha}} will tend to 0 because the numerator grows slower than the denominator raised to the power alpha. Therefore, we conclude that: [ lim_{n to infty} frac{C_1^{alpha} + C_2^{alpha} + cdots + C_n^{alpha}}{(C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_n)^{alpha}} = 0 ] (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Prove that if the sums of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal, then its angle bisectors intersect at a single point.","output":"# Problem Statement: Prove that if the sums of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal, then its angle bisectors intersect at a single point.  The given condition states that the sums of the lengths of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are equal. Let's denote the quadrilateral as (ABCD). According to the problem, we have: [ AB + CD = AD + BC ] We need to prove that the angle bisectors of the quadrilateral intersect at a single point. 1. Start with the given condition:    [ AB + CD = AD + BC ] 2. Rewrite the equation to group the sides differently:    [ AB - BC = AD - DC ] 3. Notice that if (AB > BC), then (AD > DC). 4. On sides (AB) and (AD), lay off segments (AM) and (AN) such that (BM = BC) and (DN = DC). 5. Consider the angle bisector of angle (A). This bisector intersects side (BC) (or (CD)) at point (K) (according to the angle bisector theorem). 6. Since the point (K) divides side (BC) (or (CD)) proportionally, we have:    [ frac{BK}{KC} = frac{BA}{AC} ] 7. Similarly, consider the angle bisector of angle (B) (or (D)) which intersects segment (AK) at point (O). 8. The point (O) is the center of the circle inscribed in triangle (MNC).  Let's get this straight clearly: Given (AB + CD = AD + BC), draw the diagram with these points and bisectors. You can use the use Pasha's axiom that states: \\"For any point where an angle bisector intersects, the product of two triangles formed is proportional across the sides of the intersection.\\" 9. Thus, angle bisectors (BO) and (DO) intersect at point (O). This point (O) must be the same for the other angle bisectors because it satisfies the conditions mentioned. # Conclusion: Since all angle bisectors intersect in the same way, they must indeed intersect at a single common point.

Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line, we have: [ y + 6 = 9(x + 1) ] Simplifying the equation: [ 9x - y + 3 = 0 ] Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) at x = -1 is: [ boxed{9x - y + 3 = 0} ]"},{"instruction":"the space rectangular coordinate system Oxyz, the coordinates of the point symmetrical to the point (1, 2, 1) with respect to the plane yOz are (　　)   A: (1, 2, 1)   B: (1, 2, 1)   C: (1, 2, 1)   D: (1, 2, 1)","output":"Solution: The coordinates of the point symmetrical to the point (1, 2, 1) with respect to the plane yOz are (-1, 2, 1).

Consider three different solution approaches. Here’s the detailed breakdown for each approach: # 1: Geometric Construction Approach 1. **Construct an Equilateral Triangle:**     - Draw an equilateral triangle BCL, ensuring that the points A and L are on the same side of line segment BC. 2. **Circle Property:**     - Points A, C, and L lie on the circumcircle with radius BA and centered at point B since AB = BC = CK.     - L lies on the smaller arc AC of the circumcircle because angle K_{text{in}}C - ABC is greater than 60^{circ}. 3. **Inscribed Angle:**     - The inscribed angle angle CAL equals half of the corresponding central angle angle CBL, therefore, angle CAL = frac{1}{2} cdot 60^{circ} = 30^{circ}. 4. **Symmetry and Equidistance:**     - Point K satisfies CK = BC and lies inside the isosceles triangle ABC. Thus, K is symmetric to L with respect to line AC.     - triangle AKL is equilateral as angle KAL = 30^{circ} and AK = KL = AL. 5. **Angle Calculation:**     - Since L is at the midpoint perpendicular of AL, point B also lies on this line.     - Therefore, angle AKB = angle LKB = 180^{circ} - frac{1}{2} times 60^{circ} = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 2: Altitude Intersection Approach 1. **Drop the Altitude:**     - Let the altitude BM of triangle ABC intersect line AK at point O.     - In triangle ABC, BM is both the altitude and the median because the triangle is isosceles. 2. **Angle Analysis:**     - Since CK = AB = BC and triangle ABC is isosceles, angle CAM = 60^{circ}, making angle AOM = 60^{circ}.     - This leads to angle AOC = 120^{circ} and thus angle COB = 120^{circ}. 3. **Triangles Relation:**     - triangle BOC and triangle KOC are congruent by SAS, so OB = OK. 4. **Isosceles Triangle:**     - triangle BOK is isosceles with angle BOK = 120^{circ}, giving angle OKB = 30^{circ}.     - Therefore, angle AKB = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 3: Constructing Another Equilateral Triangle 1. **Constructing an Equilateral Triangle:**     - Build an equilateral triangle ACL along AC so that L and B are on the same side of AC. 2. **Altitude and Symmetry:**     - Drop the altitude BM and note that it’s also the perpendicular bisector of AC. Since AK = BK, K lies on the same side as A from the line BM. 3. **Stating Properties:**     - Triangles BMC and KNC are congruent by the RHL theorem, ensuring BM = KN. 4. **Isosceles Trapezoid:**     - Investigate quadrilateral ALBK. angle LAK = 30^{circ} with AK = LB, showing symmetry and suggesting AK = LB (making ALBK an isosceles trapezoid). 5. **Final Angle Calculation:**     - Relate the angles, concluding angle AKB = 180^{circ} - 30^{circ} = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 4: Using Sine Theorem 1. **Representation:**     - Let angle B = 2beta. By the sine theorem in triangle AKC, we equate lengths and use C K = B C: 2BC sin beta = AC = KC cdot frac{sin angle AKC}{sin 30^{circ}} = 2BC sin angle AKC. 2. **Simplification:**     - angle AKC = 180^{circ} - beta leading to angle ACB = beta - 30^{circ}.     - Thus angle KCB = 120^{circ} - 2beta. 3. **Summation and Adjustment:**     - This makes angle KCA = angle C - angle ACB = 120^{circ} - 2beta. 4. **Half Angle and Final Computation:**     - Using angle BKC = 1/2 left(180^{circ} - angle KCBright) simplifies as angle BKA = 150^{circ}.

The first stage involves the simple random sampling (SRS) where 8 people are excluded from the total of 1008.

Thus, we can infer that at this stage, the probabilities are equal for all 1008 individuals. In the second stage, we implement systematic sampling from the remaining 1000 individuals. Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method in which selected units are spaced regularly throughout an ordered list of units. When systematic sampling is correctly applied, each individual in the remaining pool will have an equal probability of being selected.

Since every person in the 1000 has an equal chance of being selected in the systematic sampling, and the process of exclusion does not alter the probability of being selected (as those excluded are not part of the systematic sampling pool), every person in the original 1008 also has an equal probability of being included in the final 20.

Since both bridges work concurrently for a year, we need to consider the total number of vehicles passing through both bridges every month.

Therefore, for α = frac{5π}{6}: fleft(frac{5π}{6}right) = cosleft(frac{5π}{6}right) Since cos(π-x) = -cos(x) for any x, we have: fleft(frac{5π}{6}right) = cosleft(π-frac{π}{6}right) = -cosleft(frac{π}{6}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} So, the answer for the first part is fleft(frac{5π}{6}right) = boxed{-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}.
