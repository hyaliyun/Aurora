Premise: People who do that, the narrator observes, are at heart storytellers. Hypothesis: People who do that like to tell stories. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Analyzing the given premise and hypothesis, the connection between them can be examined both linguistically and logically. Premise: People who do that, the narrator observes, are at heart storytellers. Hypothesis: People who do that like to tell stories. From a linguistic perspective, we can see that the premise and hypothesis share a common subject: \\"People who do that.\\" This highlights that both statements revolve around the same group of individuals. Additionally, both statements involve the concept of storytelling, as presented by \\"storytellers\\" in the premise and \\"tell stories\\" in the hypothesis. Now, let us examine the logical structure of the statements. The premise revolves around the identity of the individuals described, stating that these people are, fundamentally, storytellers. This implies that their essential nature or key characteristic revolves around storytelling. On the other hand, the hypothesis focuses on a particular behavior or activity, which is the action of telling stories. The premise entails the hypothesis if a logical relation exists between the identity of being a storyteller and the action of telling stories. In this case, the premise implies that storytelling is a core aspect of these individuals. Being a storyteller at heart generally suggests that a person has a natural inclination for and engagement with storytelling. This is an important element of their character and is likely to be reflected in their activities and interests. Considering these aspects, it seems reasonable to conclude that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The inference here is that if an individual is a storyteller at heart, it is probable that they enjoy or like to tell stories. This connection aligns with the understanding that an inherent characteristic, such as being a storyteller, would manifest in the actions and preferences of a person. Therefore, the suggested hypothesis that \\"People who do that like to tell stories\\" is a logical deduction based on the given premise, which identifies these people as storytellers at heart."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Entrepeneurs in China who managed to get their hands on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus units have slashed prices in Beijing due to lower-than-expected demand, The New York Times reported Monday. Apple's latest handsets were selling right after launch for RMB12,000 to RMB15,000 (1,950 to 2,440) for low-end models, but prices are now down to RMB6,500 to RMB8,800 (1,060 to 1,430).      Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launched earlier this month in the US and several other countries. The devices are so far unavailable in China, which has yet to approve the device for sale there.      That hasn't stopped people from buying up units in the US and elsewhere and bringing them to China. Smugglers and sellers had believed they'd profit heavily off the devices because demand in China would be high. But that apparently is no longer the case.      Many consumers may simply be waiting for the official launch -- and the smaller price tag. It's also possible that Apple's competitors, including China-based Xiaomi, may already be filling the needs of China's consumers.      Regardless, the iPhone 6 and 6Plus have been selling briskly worldwide. Apple sold a record 10 million iPhone units in the first 72 hours on store shelves. So far, Apple hasn't said when the Chinese launch will happen, though early October is possible. The company has received partial regulatory approval and is waiting for the final okay. Apple will likely confirm its China launch at least a week in advance to build hype.      China is an important segment of Apple's business, representing about 16 percent of its total sales in the second quarter.      Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ||||| The world’s most popular smartphone range is finally available to subscribers of the world’s biggest mobile carrier. Yes, the iPhone today went on sale to China Mobile subscribers.      But it does not come cheap. It is not quite Brazil prices (R2,799, or US1,184 for the 16GB iPhone 5s from the Apple store) but iPhone in China is more expensive than it is in the US, at Rmb 5,288 (872) versus 649 for the iPhone 5S 16GB.      As Lex points out, maintaining that pricing power and being seen as a premium product will be key for Apple, with competition in the lower end starting to heat up.      For consumers, mobile operator subsidies will help reduce that cost, though China Mobile’s offer is no cheaper than its competitors China Unicom and China Telecom, which have already long offered the iPhone. This suggests that China Mobile is thinking too of its own profit margins and holding back its subsidies.      Here’s how the prices compare:      iPhone 5S 16G      US Apple store: unlocked 649      US Carriers: starts at 199 with a two-year contract starting at 80/month from Verizon      China Apple store: Rmb 5,288 (872)      China Mobile: Free (after rebate) with a two-year plan and monthly bill of Rmb 588 (97), or Rmb 5,288 with no contract and 1.2GB of free 4G data thrown in, or      China Unicom: Ranging from free with a two-year plan and monthly bill of Rmb 586, or Rmb 4,699 (776) with a one-year contract and Rmb 66 (11) monthly bill      Samsung Galaxy 4S      Samsung online China store: Rmb4,899 (808)      US: 689 through Walmart site or with Verizon, 199 with 80/month 2-year contract      Xiaomi      Xiaomi 3, 16GB, sold through their online site: Rmb1,999 (330)      Hongmi, sold through their online site: Rmb 699 (115) ||||| Add a location to your Tweets      When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Chinese media is reporting that a man has been stopped at Futian Port in China with 94 iPhones attached to his body with cling film and sticky tape – a technique referred to in coverage as “iPhone armour”.      According to The Huffington Post he was spotted because of his “weird walking posture, joint stiffness and muscle tension”. One phone in a pocket can be uncomfortable, so one can only imagine how awkward it is to carry 94.      All of Apple’s iPhones are made in China under contract before being shipped to countries around the world. But actually buying one in the country can be difficult.      Until recently there was no official way other than to resort to the black market. Now there are deals with legitimate providers such as China Mobile but contracts and handsets are relatively expensive compared to devices from Chinese manufacturers.      Even then, supply is limited, especially of the latest models. This means that buying new or second-hand handsets elsewhere in the world and smuggling them into China can be extremely profitable.      From the photographs it appears that the majority of these handsets are second-hand iPhone 5S but there are also some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.      The penalties for smuggling under Hong Kong law, where this man was reportedly caught, can be as high as a 2m (£171,000) fine and seven years in prison. ||||| Turns out, iPhones are expensive in China.      Expensive enough to inspire people into strapping dozens of the things to themselves in sheets of plastic armour and trying to make it through customs.      These photos have emerged on a Chinese social media site of a man who reportedly tried to go through Futian Port in China with 94 iPhones strapped to his body.      The man was apparently identified only by his gait - he had a \\" \\"weird walking posture, joint stiffness, muscle tension\\" and -- when forced through a metal detector -- tons and tons of Apple hardware around his waist.      The man had arrived from Hong Kong, where apparently iPhones are cheaper (or easier to get hold of on the black market).      So how expensive are iPhones in China? According to the FT, an unlocked 16GB iPhone 6 is around 872 compared to 649 in the US.      Since the average worker in China earns about 4,755 a year, that's about 18% of an average annual salary. Were that scaled up in the UK that would be an equivalent of £4770. ||||| Summary:","output":"A man was caught attempting to smuggle 94 iPhones into China at Futian Port. He had the iPhones strapped to his body, and his unusual walking posture and muscle tension alerted customs officers. The price of smuggled iPhones in China has dropped due to lower-than-expected demand, paving the way for the potential increase in smuggling attempts to make a profit. However, many consumers may be waiting for the official launch of the devices at a lower price, or turning to Apple's competitors like Xiaomi to fulfill their needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charlie Ward Jr. (born October 12, 1970) is a retired American professional NBA basketball player, college football Heisman Trophy winner, Davey O'Brien Award winner and a Major League Baseball draftee. Despite his NCAA football success, Ward was one of the very few players who won a Heisman trophy but was not drafted in the NFL draft. He won the College Football National Championship Game with the Florida State University Seminoles. Ward played several years with the New York Knicks and started in the NBA Finals. Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, and Davey O'Brien Award as a quarterback for Florida State University, and subsequently led the Seminoles to their first-ever National Championship when FSU defeated Nebraska 18-16 in the 1993 Orange Bowl. The Seminoles had suffered their only defeat of the season to a second-ranked Notre Dame team, but their path to the National Championship was cleared a week later when the Irish were upset at home by Boston College. Ward holds the third-largest margin of victory in the history of Heisman trophy balloting, with a 1,622-point difference, third only to O.J. Simpson's 1,750-point win in 1968 and Troy Smith's 1,662-point win in 2006. He was also the only Heisman winner to play in the NBA. In 1993, Charlie Ward won the James E. Sullivan Award from the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) as the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States.  Though Ward did not play baseball in college, he was drafted as a pitcher by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 59th round of the 1993 free agent draft and in the 18th round by the New York Yankees in 1994. An avid tennis player, Ward also shone in the Arthur Ashe Amateur Tennis Tournament in 1994.  Ward was a model student-athlete at Florida State. As a senior and captain of the team in 1993, he voluntarily approached Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden about a difficult situation surrounding incoming freshman Warrick Dunn, whose mother, policewoman Betty Smothers, was killed in the line of duty during Dunn's senior year of high school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Charlie served as a surrogate big brother to Dunn during the latter's first year in Tallahassee, helping him through a trying time by becoming his roommate and friend. With Ward's help on and off the field, Dunn eventually became one of the better running backs in the country and a first-round NFL draft pick.  Ward also played basketball for four years at Florida State University (FSU). Former teammates included future NBA players Bob Sura, Doug Edwards, and Sam Cassell. His 1993 team made it to the Southeast Regional Final where they lost to Kentucky 106-81 with the winner advancing to the Final Four. Ward's 1992 team made the Sweet Sixteen. He made the game-winning shot in its Metro Conference Tournament Championship game win over Louisville in 1991. Ward still holds FSU basketball records for career steals at 236, steals in one game at 9 and still ranks sixth all-time in assists at 396. He played a shortened season his senior year, joining the basketball team just 15 days after winning the Heisman Trophy. He started 16 games at the point guard position that year, and averaged a college career high of 10.5 points and 4.9 assists for the season.  In his senior year at Florida State, he also served as Student Government Vice-President, after he was asked to run by the Monarchy Party, a student government reform organization.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 11*v + 900 = -11*v - 28*v for v.","output":"Okay sweetheart, let's solve this fun puzzle together step by step.  First, we have an equation that looks like this: 11*v + 900 = -11*v - 28*v Let's bring all the terms with \\"v\\" on one side and without \\"v\\" (the numbers all alone) on the other side.  To do this, we add 11*v and 28*v on both sides to cancel them out from the right side and then they are added to the left side: 11*v + 11*v + 28*v + 900 = -11*v - 28*v + 11*v + 28*v  This simplifies to: 50*v + 900 = 0  Now, we move the number 900 to the right side by subtracting 900 from both sides. That gives us: 50*v = -900   Finally, to figure out what 1*v (or just v) is, we divide both sides by 50 because we have 50 of them on the left, which gives: v = -900 / 50   Finally, doing the division, we find v equals -18.

Article: A stretch fabric works best for making leggings, so opt for a stretch jersey, spandex, rayon with lycra, or some other type of stretchy fabric. You will need about 2 to 3 yards (1.8 to 2.7 m) of fabric depending on your size. If you are making leggings for a baby or toddler, then you will only need about 1 yard (0.91 m) of fabric. For baby and toddler leggings, you can also use a printed t-shirt for fabric. Make sure it is a shirt that you are willing cut up. You can use an old t-shirt or buy one on clearance. To create the pattern for the leggings, you will also need a pair of old leggings that fit you (or the person who will wear the leggings). If the leggings are a little smaller than you want them to be, then you can draw outside of the edges of the leggings to make them larger. You will need a piece of elastic that is long enough to wrap around the waist of the person who will wear the leggings. You can opt for a narrow piece of elastic, such as a piece that is 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) wide, or you can go with a wider piece, such as a piece that is 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. The elastic will be hidden in the waistband, so you can use any color. To create your own custom pair of leggings, you will need to make a pattern first. That will require some paper that you can trace the outline of your folded leggings onto and a black marker.

Under 100 words is a good title length. The genome sequences of new viruses often contain many \\"orphan\\" or \\"taxon-specific\\" proteins apparently lacking homologs. However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection methods such as BLAST may overlook homologs. We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as \\"genus specific\\" by BLAST. More powerful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant homologs of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods should be used to annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant homologs of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated methods and manual analyses can uncover distant homologs of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodological results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify homologs of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying homologs provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP24, with homologs in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses, higreviruses, blunerviruses, negeviruses); and a putative virion glycoprotein, ORF2, also found in negeviruses. SP24 and ORF2 are probably major structural components of the virions.

I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too.

The album was produced by Ohad Benchetrit and Charles Spearin and was titled Broken Social Scene presents ..Spirit If.... The album was recorded throughout 2004 and 2006 in Ohad Benchetrit's house while the band was not on tour. Although billed as a solo project, most Broken Social Scene members make cameo appearances. The sound itself is Broken Social Scene's familiar mix of rough and ragged, sad and celebratory, with psychedelic swells and acoustic jangles. Also featured are Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis and Canadian rock icon Tom Cochrane playing and singing and handclapping along. The album was released on September 18, 2007 and a tour billed as Broken Social Scene Performs Kevin Drew's Spirit If... took place in late 2007.

He has played for the Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Seibu Lions of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). Can we draw the following conclusion? Daisuke Matsuzaka wears baseball gloves","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Daisuke Matsuzaka wears baseball gloves. Daisuke Matsuzaka is a professional baseball player, more specifically, a pitcher. Baseball is a sport that requires specific protective equipment, known as baseball gear, which includes items like a helmet, cleats, catcher's gear, and the essential baseball glove. The sport, whether played professionally or not, demands the use of a baseball glove by players. A baseball glove, or mitt, is a large leather glove that professional baseball players use to assist them in catching and fielding balls hit by a batter or thrown by a teammate. As a pitcher, Matsuzaka uses a specific type of glove that is uniquely designed for his role on the field. Pitcher's gloves usually have a closed webbing to hide the ball and the grip of the pitcher from the batter's view. These gloves are typically smaller and have a shallower pocket than other baseball fielding gloves. This design helps pitchers quickly transfer the ball from the glove to the throwing hand to carry out plays swiftly. Matsuzaka playing professional baseball for both the Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan adds even more support to this conclusion. Both of these leagues are highly professional and follow all equipment norms diligently. Hence, Daisuke Matsuzaka wearing a baseball glove is not only a requirement of the game but also a necessity for his professional performance and safety.  In addition, while the design and details of the glove may vary based on personal preference or sponsorship deals, the fact remains that a baseball pitcher like Daisuke Matsuzaka relies heavily on this piece of equipment during games. Therefore, it is an undeniable fact that Matsuzaka wears baseball gloves as a part of his sporting gear."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer a question about the following article about Germans: The event of the Protestant Reformation and the politics that ensued has been cited as the origins of German identity that arose in response to the spread of a common German language and literature. Early German national culture was developed through literary and religious figures including Martin Luther, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. The concept of a German nation was developed by German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. The popularity of German identity arose in the aftermath of the French Revolution. When did the popularity of the German nation increase?","output":"The popularity of the German nation increased in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which took place between 1789 and 1799. This was a critical period in European history, during which long-standing political, social, and economic structures were challenged and ultimately dismantled, leading to the rise of new ideologies and movements. The French Revolution had far-reaching effects on the entirety of Europe, including Germany, which was not yet a unified nation at the time. Prior to the revolution, Germany was divided into numerous small states that formed the Holy Roman Empire, each with its own distinct political and social character. The upheaval caused by the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who sought to expand French influence in Europe, spurred a growing sense of nationalism among the German people. German intellectuals, inspired by Enlightenment ideals and seeing the French Revolution as a catalyst for change, began to express the importance of a unified German identity. Johann Gottfried Herder, a prominent German philosopher and writer, is often credited with developing the concept of a German nation. Herder believed that a shared language, culture, and history were essential elements for the formation of a national identity, which he articulated in his works. Revolutionary ideas and the desire for political and cultural self-determination spread throughout Germany, eventually leading to the Wars of Liberation against Napoleon in 1813-1815. These conflicts united various German territories in a common struggle against their oppressors, further strengthening the sense of nationalist sentiment among the population. Moreover, the works of German literary and religious figures like Martin Luther, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller contributed significantly to the development of a German national culture. Luther's translation of the Bible into German in the 16th century helped standardize the German language, while Goethe and Schiller's literary accomplishments in the 18th century proliferated the German language, culture, and ideals throughout the nation. In the 19th century, the growing popularity of the German nation eventually led to the unification of Germany under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck. The newly unified German Empire was officially established in 1871, marking the solidification of German identity and nationalism. To summarize, the popularity of the German nation increased in the aftermath of the French Revolution as German intellectuals and the population at large sought to establish a unified identity based on shared language, culture, and history. The influence of prominent figures such as Herder, Luther, Goethe, and Schiller, as well as political developments and the struggle for independence from foreign rule, all contributed significantly to the rise of German nationalism during this period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Wound healing Wound healing is a critical aspect of surgery.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"zinc has a positive impact after what\\" with the following options:  - surgery  - leukemia  - Cooking  - cycles  - cancer  - disease  - exercise  - the skin A:","output":"Zinc has a positive impact after surgery. This is because wound healing is a crucial aspect of the surgical process, and it has been established that zinc, as an essential mineral, contributes significantly to the wound healing process. Adequate zinc levels in the body can lead to faster healing times, reduced inflammation, and overall better outcomes for patients who have undergone surgery. Zinc has several functions that directly affect wound healing, such as its role in enzyme production, protein synthesis, and cell division—all critically important processes for tissue repair and regeneration. It is also responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of proteins and cell membranes, which contribute to the overall health of the skin and other body tissues. In addition to its direct impact on the wound healing process, zinc also has indirect benefits for patients recovering from surgery. It helps boost the immune system, which is essential for warding off infection post-surgery. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce not only inflammation but also oxidative stress, both of which can delay the healing process. While zinc has these positive effects on surgery and specifically the wound healing process, it is essential to note that it may not have significant effects on the other options provided, such as leukemia, cooking, cycles, cancer, disease, exercise, or the skin on its own. Although, in some cases, zinc can assist in the overall health and well-being of individuals, specifically where immune function is concerned. For example, zinc is vital for supporting a healthy immune system, which may indirectly aid in combating diseases, including certain types of cancer. In conclusion, zinc has a positive impact after surgery, primarily due to its critical role in the wound healing process. Its various functions in enzyme production, protein synthesis, and cell division contribute to faster and more effective tissue repair and regeneration. Additionally, it can also boost immune function and reduce inflammation, both of which are essential for post-surgery recovery. However, it may not have direct impacts on the other options provided, although its role in maintaining overall health can have some indirect benefits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But each had mistakenly signed the other’s will after an 'oversight' Their natural sons challenged the validity of the will in 2006. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: \\"Adopted Son's Inheritance in Jeopardy Due to Blended Family's Will Mishap\\" Introduction: A peculiar oversight has led to a legal dispute regarding the inheritance of Terry Marley, the adopted son of Alfred and Maureen Rawlings. The couple, who had made identical wills leaving a portion of their fortune to Mr. Marley, had inadvertently signed each other's documents. As a result, their natural sons decided to contest the validity of the will in 2006. Step 1: Provide background information on the family Alfred and Maureen Rawlings, a well-to-do couple, adopted Terry Marley and treated him as their own child. In addition, the couple had two natural sons, who grew up alongside Terry as siblings. Throughout their lives, the family maintained close relationships and there had been no known disputes until the matter of the wills arose. Step 2: Detail the circumstances surrounding the wills In an effort to secure Terry Marley's financial future, Alfred and Maureen Rawlings crafted two identical wills, with each document specifying that a significant portion of their estate would be bequeathed to their adopted son. However, due to a lapse in attention, the couple mistakenly signed each other's wills, effectively rendering the documents legally questionable. Step 3: Explain the legal challenge presented by the natural sons Upon discovering the error in the wills, the natural sons of Alfred and Maureen Rawlings decided to challenge the validity of the documents in 2006. Their primary argument was that the wills were not legally binding due to the signing error, and that this mistake revokes their adopted brother's claim to the inheritance. Step 4: Discuss the potential consequences of this legal dispute As this case proceeds, it has the potential to set a precedent regarding the importance of meticulous attention to detail during the estate planning process. In addition to leaving Terry Marley's inheritance in a precarious state, it raises questions about the consequences of such oversights in otherwise well-intentioned legal documents. Step 5: Address the impact on the family and the broader society The case of the Rawlings family highlights the importance of careful planning and attention to detail in matters concerning inheritance and estate distribution. The blended family, once content and harmonious, now finds itself entangled in a complex legal issue that could leave one member struggling for financial stability. This serves as a cautionary tale for others, emphasizing the necessity of clear communication and precision in the drafting and signing of legal documents. Conclusion: The dispute over the wills of Alfred and Maureen Rawlings captures the attention of both legal professionals and the general public alike. At its core, this case serves as a sobering reminder of the potential long-lasting effects that a simple oversight can have on families and estate planning.

Stunned onlookers at the Air Fiesta show watched as the plane plummeted, leaving a white trail behind as it dove toward a wooded area near an airport in Brownsville, Texas. The stunt team onboard -- married couple Kyle and Amanda Franklin -- \\"suffered severe burns following the crash,\\" according to a statement on the air show's website. They were in the middle of a wing-walking act when the engine problems began, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. \\"The female wing-walker was able to get back into the airplane, but the plane crashed into a thicket near the runway,\\" Lunsford said. On their website, the couple describes their act: \\"Together Kyle and Amanda have created a swaggering, wing-walking pirate show that would make Captain Jack Sparrow gulp. This flying circus of \\"Pirated Skies\\" will have audiences yelling 'Aaargh' as Amanda wing walks, playing the part of 'Scandalous Scarlett' and sword fights with Kyle, the menacing 'Captain Kyro.'\\" The statement on the air show's website, which includes a painting of the couple sword-fighting in a plane with a skull and crossbones, said the two-day event would continue Sunday \\"and will be dedicated to Kyle and Amanda.\\" According to their website, both pilots' fathers were also stunt pilots who died when their planes collided in a mid-air collision at an air show in 2005. \\"Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on wings of airplanes,\\" the site says.

Generate a question that has more than 7 words. You can paraphrase the given context while forming the question.  Suggestion: The question may involve starting question words like WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHAT (in Spanish). CONTEXT: La organización humanitaria Handicap International (HI) pidió hoy a Estados Unidos y Vietnam que se adhieran cuanto antes al Tratado Internacional de Prohibición de las Minas Antipersonas y dejen de fabricar ese tipo de armas. HI, co-promotora de la Campaña Internacional para la Prohibición de las Minas Antipersonas, hizo su llamamiento coincidiendo con el viaje a Vietnam iniciado hoy por el presidente de EEUU, Bill Clinton, primer jefe de Estado estadounidense que visita ese país desde 1969. Estados Unidos y Vietnam son dos de los 16 Estados que todavía fabrican minas antipersonas y dos de los 54 países que no se han adherido al Tratado de Prohibición, redactado en 1997 y respaldado por 139 naciones. En un comunicado, la organización humanitaria explicó que Estados Unidos destina 1,7 millones de dólares en ayudas a desactivar ese tipo de bombas en Vietnam. Pero \\"este loable esfuerzo tendría mayor sentido si se acompañase de la búsqueda de una solución definitiva\\" al problema, con un compromiso claro de los gobiernos respectivos en favor de su prohibición, afirmó HI. Más de 100.000 personas han muerto o han resultado heridas a causa de estas bombas desde que terminó la guerra entre los dos países hace 25 años, según datos facilitados en 1998 por las autoridades vietnamitas, señaló HI. ANSWER: que se adhieran cuanto antes al Tratado Internacional de Prohibición de las Minas Antipersonas y dejen de fabricar ese tipo de armas","output":"QUESTION: ¿Cuál es la petición que la organización humanitaria Handicap International hace a Estados Unidos y Vietnam durante la visita del presidente Bill Clinton a Vietnam, con respecto al Tratado Internacional de Prohibición de las Minas Antipersonas y la fabricación de esas armas?"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Usage: In this scenario, it is mentioned that there are 3300 bananas and they need to be organized into 75 groups. The problem implies that an operation has to be performed to calculate the number of bananas present in each group. Here the operation happens to be division. Why: The context of the situation implies a division operation - as we are distributing a total number of items into several groups evenly.  Part #2: Ignoring irrelevant information. Usage: The text \\"janice also has 5 crayons.\\" is irrelevant to solving the problem because crayons have no bearing on the organization of bananas into groups. Why: This part helps to focus only on the necessary elements required for answering the question. Part #3: Identification of the mathematical operation to be used. Usage: In the given problem, since the task is to find out how big each group is when a total number of 3300 bananas are organized into 75 groups - we recognize this as a division operation. Why: Understanding the operation to use is vital to solving the problem - division is used here to distribute the bananas evenly to the groups. Part #4: Application of the mathematical operator on the identified numbers. Usage: Perform the division operation between the two numbers embedded in the text. Here, we would divide 3300 by 75, yielding the result of 44. Why: This part involves executing the operation - applying division to find out the number of bananas in each group. Part #5: Reporting of final numerical answer. Usage: We obtain an answer of 44 and without attaching any additional context or information, we report this numerical value as the final solution. Why: Reporting only the numerical solution is part of the task definition - keeping the answer precise and direct to the point."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Bringing up Baby Movie plot: David Huxley (Cary Grant) is a mild-mannered paleontologist. For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the \\"intercostal clavicle\\". Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random (May Robson), who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum. The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) by chance on a golf course. She is a free-spirited young lady, and (unknown to him at first) Mrs. Random's niece. Susan's brother, Mark, has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby (Nissa) to give to their aunt. (The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America.) Susan thinks David is a zoologist (rather than a paleontologist), and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby (which includes singing \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" to soothe the leopard). Complications arise as Susan falls in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage. David finally receives the intercostal clavicle, but Susan's dog George (Asta) steals and buries it. Susan's aunt, Elizabeth Random, arrives.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.  After reading the above, is \\"Chinese customs\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What parts of Chinese culture were brought into Japanese society?\\"?","output":"While \\"Chinese customs\\" is part of the answer, the text suggests that multiple facets of Chinese culture were integrated into Japanese society. Along with Chinese customs, Chinese Buddhism (involving sacred images and scriptures), religion, history, music, literature, painting, and patterns of centralized government were also brought into Japanese society. The use of the Chinese calendar in Japan also reflects this influence. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that various elements of Chinese culture, including but not limited to \\"Chinese customs,\\" were integrated into Japanese society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The War Game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. It hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the Soviet Union would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Sarah and Sophie are sisters living in two different cities. Sarah lives in a very rural area with hardly any air pollution. Sophie lives in a heavily industrialized urban area with many factories and people driving cars to their destinations. This all leads to Sophie's city having a large amount of pollution going into the atmosphere.  Does Sophie's city do more or less harm to the environment than Sarah's?  Hint: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Answer:","output":"Sophie's city does more harm to the environment than Sarah's rural area. This is due to several contributing factors including higher amounts of industrial and vehicular emissions in the city. Factories, power plants, and vehicles emit harmful substances such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, all contributing to air pollution. Air pollution has numerous negative impacts on human health and the environment. As mentioned, breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases like asthma and lung cancer, and may also contribute to other health problems. Children are especially vulnerable to air pollution as their lungs are still developing, and they also take in more air for their size compared to adults. Air pollution can also harm the environment, affecting plants, animals, and entire ecosystems. Specific types of damage depend on the pollutant. For example, sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the air can cause acid rain, which can lead to the degradation of natural environments such as forests and water bodies. Furthermore, air pollution can contribute to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. In summary, Sophie's city, with its higher levels of air pollution due to industrialization and transportation, does more harm to the environment than Sarah's rural area. This is because air pollution negatively impacts human health, particularly children's health, and can cause various types of environmental damage, ranging from acid rain to climate change."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. While eating breakfast at Rita's house, Dexter is called to a crime scene, only to discover that it is the same salvage yard where he committed a double murder the previous night. He finds Valerie Castillo's (Valerie Dillman) body lying in the Airstream trailer where he killed her and her husband Jorge (José Zúñiga), despite having thrown the corpses into the ocean. He deduces that the \`\`Ice Truck Killer''--a serial killer with whom Dexter has a personal connection--dived underwater to retrieve the woman's body and plant it in the trailer. In the yard, LaGuerta, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) discover a young Cuban boy, Oscar (Cesar Flores), hiding in the trunk of a car who claims to have seen somebody take Valerie into the trailer. He begins to fear discovery, and experiences his first nightmare: Debra is a serial killer with an identical modus operandi to Dexter. As the investigation proceeds, he attempts to shoot down each of his colleagues' leads on the case. When Debra asks him to read through her report on the killer, profiling a man sharing many of Dexter's characteristics, he second-guesses her theory and she is hurt. Worried about coming under suspicion, he throws all of his knives overboard from his boat, but while looking at the blood drops from his victims, he notices that Valerie's slide has a happy face etched into the blood. He realizes that this is a hint from the Ice Truck Killer, and plants Jorge's fingerprints and a dry drop of Valerie's blood onto a knife, which he hides in a car at the salvage yard. He convinces Doakes to organize another search of the yard, where an officer (Denver Dowridge) finds the knife. After successfully framing Jorge for Valerie's murder, Dexter discovers that Oscar's description of the man who \`\`saved'' him from Valerie is in fact Jesus Christ.

What is the most logical next event? How to train big dogs  Start early.  Although this may not always be an option, starting the dog training process when your dog is less than 1 year old is ideal, especially when it comes to large dogs. Plan to begin training your dog as soon as you bring it home, which may be as early as 8 weeks. Possible answers: (1). This will give the dog time to get used to the surrounding environment and to associate being outdoors with meals and exercise. Start early enough to train your dog.; (2). Early training gives your dog the energy to start training. Each puppy should start out near age one and mature well within the first six weeks.; (3). If you're training a puppy, keep the sessions short and integrate play into them to keep your puppy engaged. When training an older dog, expect the process to take a bit longer, and require a little more patience.; (4). Training is easier if a dog is less than 17 weeks old. This may be especially important if you have young children in the house and your dog is not used to being on its own.;","output":"(3).

Records was launched.      Tab Hunter, the chiseled 1950s heartthrob who portrayed Joe Hardy in the Damn Yankees! movie, had a No. 1 record and starred in two outlandish films with the drag queen Divine, has died. He was 86.      Hunter died Sunday night in Santa Barbara from a blood clot that caused a heart attack, Allan Glaser, his romantic partner of more than three decades, told The Hollywood Reporter, describing his death as \\"unexpected and sudden.\\" A Facebook page linked to the star also announced his passing with a message that read: \\"SAD NEWS: Tab passed away tonight three days shy of his 87th birthday. Please honor his memory by saying a prayer on his behalf. He would have liked that.\\"      After decades of silence, the leading man confirmed long-standing rumors about his homosexuality in his autobiography, Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star, published in 2005.      Hunter said he had been told by Glaser that someone was planning to write a book about him. \\"I thought, 'Look, get it from the horse's mouth and not from some horse's ass after I'm dead and gone,'\\" he told THR's Scott Feinberg in 2015. \\"I didn't want someone putting a spin on my life.\\"      THR reported in June that the story of the relationship between Hunter and Anthony Perkins, who played Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho, is in the works as a film from Zachary Quinto and J.J. Abrams.      The film, titled Tab & Tony, is based on Hunter’s account of coming to terms with his sexuality in 1950s Hollywood. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions and Quinto are producing, along with Glaser and Neil Koenigsberg.      With his Malibu-style, boy-next-door looks and stage name dreamed up by Henry Willson — the agent for Rock Hudson as well — the blondish Hunter was a constant presence on the front of fan and teen magazines in his heyday. (A photo of him bare-chested was used as the cover of the 2000 book Shirtless! The Hollywood Male Physique.)      After Hunter beat out James Dean and Paul Newman to portray a young Marine in Raoul Walsh's Battle Cry (1955), Warner Bros. picked up his option and signed him to a seven-year contract, and he appeared in The Girl He Left Behind (1956) and Burning Hills (1956).      Studio head Jack Warner then purchased the film rights to the Tony-winning Broadway musical Damn Yankees! (1958) for Hunter to star in as Washington Senators slugger Hardy. He replaced Stephen Douglass as the lone principal actor who did not make the transition from the stage.      In The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: \\"Tab Hunter may not have the larynx that Stephen Douglass had as the original hero, but he has the clean, naive look of a lad breaking into the big leagues and into the magical company of a first-rate star. He is really appealing with Miss [Gwen] Verdon in the boogie-woogie ballet, \\"Two Lost Souls,\\" which is done in a smoky, soft-lit setting and is the dandiest dance number in the film.\\"      In a similar athletic vein, Hunter played troubled Boston Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall on a 1955 episode of the CBS anthology series Climax! Like the 1957 movie that starred Anthony Perkins, it was based on the ballplayer's memoir, Fear Strikes Out.      Hunter's recording of \\"Young Love\\" for Dot Records in 1957 reached No. 1 and stayed there for six weeks, knocking Elvis Presley's \\"Too Much\\" out of the top spot and prompting the creation of Warner Bros. Records. (Jack Warner was annoyed that his studio did not have a record company to capitalize on Hunter's vocal skills, so he started one.)      Skewing his surfer-boy image, Hunter played Todd Tomorrow, a dashing owner of a drive-in, opposite Divine in the John Waters black comedy Polyester (1981), which introduced Odorama to theaters via a scratch-and-sniff card. (Among the scents: \\"Flatulence,\\" \\"Model Building Glue\\" and \\"Smelly Shoes.\\")      And in a saucy send-up of Westerns, director Paul Bartels' Lust in the Dust (1985), Hunter reteamed with Divine. He and Glaser also produced the film.      He was born Arthur Andrew Kelm on July 11, 1931, in New York City. When he was young, his family moved to California, where his natural athleticism flourished, and he became an avid horseman.      At 15, he enlisted in the Coast Guard, lying about his age. Following the service, he was introduced by actor Dick Clayton to Willson, who decided that his birth name did not have the right commercial ring and that the actor needed a new \\"tab\\" (slang for \\"name\\" at the time).      Hunter made his movie debut in The Lawless (1950), then appeared opposite Linda Darnell in the romantic South Sea adventure Island of Desire (1952), in which he stripped down to skimpy swim trunks.      He studied under the influential acting teacher Jeff Corey and worked on such United Artists films as Gun Belt (1953) and Return to Treasure Island (1954) before signing with Warners.      Hunter, Dean and Natalie Wood were the last three actors to land contracts at Warner Bros. in the waning days of the studio system, and he received a massive PR buildup. He was given the nickname \\"The Sigh Guy\\" and from 1955 to '59 was Warners' top-grossing star.      Even as the studio was sponsoring \\"Win a Date With Tab Hunter\\" contests, Hunter was keeping his sexual orientation a secret while being seen in public with the likes of Wood, Sophia Loren and Debbie Reynolds.      \\"I never mentioned my sexuality to Warner Bros. at all, and they never mentioned it to me, thank God,\\" Hunter told Feinberg. He did have a serious relationship with Perkins, however.      In a 2015 column written for THR, Hunter said that Louella Parsons of the Los Angeles Examiner and Hedda Hopper of the Los Angeles Times \\"would never openly discuss my sexuality — they couldn't in those days — but both periodically made subtle references to it in their columns, wondering when I was going to settle down with a nice girl and then, after the studio began pairing me with my dear friend Natalie Wood on faux dates, asking if I was 'the sort of guy' she wanted to end up with.\\"      His career was put in jeopardy after Confidential magazine published a story about how he had been arrested at a party attended by gay people shortly after he arrived in Hollywood.      Hunter starred for a season (1960-61) on NBC's The Tab Hunter Show, playing a bachelor cartoonist who lives in Malibu. (Future Community actor Richard Erdman played a playboy and his best friend.)      He starred in such films as That Kind of Woman (1959), Operation Bikini (1963) and Man With Two Faces (1964), but then the countercultural '60s had arrived, and Hunter's teen-idol image went out of fashion. Long hair and rebellion were in, epitomized by anti-establishment stars like Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson.      Yet Hunter rode with the cultural wave instead of against it, seeking out balmy, offbeat projects. He co-starred in a mordant satire of the funeral industry, The Loved One (1965), with such loony luminati as Liberace and Jonathan Winters.      Paul Newman ordered his lynching in John Huston's The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972), and on the syndicated TV satires Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and Forever Fernwood, his character, after being removed from a chemical accident, came to look exactly like — voila! — Tab Hunter.      He also appeared on such shows as Burke's Law, The Virginian, Cannon, McMillan & Wife, The Six Million Dollar Man, Ellery Queen, The Love Boat, Benson and Masquerade.      He played the substitute teacher Mr. Stuart in Grease 2 (1982) and a decade later penned the story for Dark Horse (1992), which starred Ed Begley Jr. and Mimi Rogers in a story about a spoiled girl who goes to a horse ranch.      Hunter's sole Broadway credit was in the 1964 production, directed by Tony Richardson, of Tennessee Williams' The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore, in which he appeared as a young stud caught trespassing on the Italian estate of a dying, wealthy woman, played by Tallulah Bankhead. Slightly revised by Williams following its poorly received Broadway premiere the year before, the play fared no better, closing after just a few days.      A feature documentary about him, also titled Tab Hunter Confidential, was released in 2015 and produced by Glaser.      \\"If I had come out during my acting career in the 1950s, I would not have had a career,\\" Hunter said in an October 2017 interview. \\"Not much in Hollywood has changed in 60 years. I really didn't talk about my sexuality until I wrote my autobiography.      \\"My film career had long since been over by then. I believe one's sexuality is one's own business. I really don't go around discussing it. Call me 'old school' on that topic.\\"      Rhett Bartlett contributed to this report. ||||| Published on May 10, 2013      Late in 1956, Randy Wood - the founder and president of Dot Records - met the young, hot star Tab Hunter. Mr. Wood asked Tab if he would like to make a record. Tab confessed that he was not really a singer, but Randy explained that you do not have to be a great singer to make a good record. On Saturday, December 15, 1956 - at Ryder Sound on Santa Monica Blvd. in Hollywood - Tab had his first recording session. Tab explained in his autobiography that Randy hired \\"some\\" singers to harmonize with him - those singers turned out to be The Jordanaires - Elvis' backup group. \\"Man, this was serious stuff. I was starting to feel the pressure.\\" Tab confessed. After a few takes, his nerves settled down and the 11th take was \\"it\\". When - later in the week - Tab heard his record on the radio - he himself had to admit that \\"I'll be damned - \\"Young Love\\" sounded pretty good\\". Randy rushed Tab back into the studio to make some additional songs. However, when a Warner Bros. attorney heard \\"Young Love\\" on the radio - which was becoming a smash hit - things hit the fan. Tab Hunter was under contract to Warner Bros. for EVERYTHING - not only motion pictures. \\"Jack Warner may have magnanimously declined to pass judgment on my personal life, but if there was a buck to be made - he OWNED me.\\" By February 2, 1957, when the record reached #4 on the charts, a deal was cut whereupon Dot had to pay Warner Bros. a hefty compensation for any Tab Hunter record in release. When the studio's lawyers found out that Randy had enough songs for an LP - they barred Dot from releasing anything beyond singles that had already been shipped. \\"Randy Wood was holding orders for 100,000 albums. He was sitting on a gold mine, but Warner Bros. had no intention of letting him, or me, profit from a singing voice IT owned. At first I brushed it off, like I usually did. I'd been carried away by my enthusiasm and my naivete, resulting in a guileless breach of contract. Big deal. Then, Randy Wood handed me my first \\"Young Love\\" royalty check. I don't recall the total, but I remember precisely the Internal Revenue Service's cut - 56,000. That was just the taxes! I was making WAY more money as a pop singer than as a contract player at Warner Bros. That was a real eye-opener.\\" In an indirect way, Tab's recording success at Dot was an impetus for Warner Bros. to start their own records label - which later on, Tab Hunter wound up recording for (which hopefully made Jack Warner very happy). Tab's record of \\"Young Love\\" was a cover of Sonny James on Capitol. In 1966, Lesley Gore recorded her own version of \\"Young Love\\" on Mercury Records which was a moderate hit for her.

He was in many movies and people really liked him. He was also secretly gay, but he didn't talk about it much. In 2005, he wrote a book about his life and being gay in Hollywood, and now there's going to be a movie about it, called \\"Tab & Tony\\". The movie is about Tab's relationship with another actor named Anthony Perkins. Even though it was a long time ago, Tab still thinks Hollywood needs to change and be more accepting of people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Combine the terms with n on one side of the equation: -15n + 44 = 7n To combine the terms, add 15n to both sides of the equation: -15n + 15n + 44 = 7n + 15n This simplifies to: 44 = 22n 2. Divide by the coefficient of n (in this case, 22) to isolate n: 44 = 22n To isolate n, divide both sides by 22: 44 / 22 = 22n / 22 This simplifies to: 2 = n So, n = 2 is the solution."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the area that had upward movement of magma under it? ?  The creation of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting. Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera, coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington, alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region. Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono–Inyo fissure system. The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches (30 cm) in five years. Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift.Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to issue a \\"potential volcanic hazard\\" notice for Long Valley. That same year, permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started. The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground. From 1990 to 1996, 150 acres (60 ha) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20% to 95% concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil (less than 1% is normal). Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma. Answer:","output":"Long Valley Caldera"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks.  Answer this question please: Which town had fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions? A:","output":"Based on the background given, Rob's town, which is located in a valley near parks, would likely have fewer cyclists riding in slippery conditions. This is because Bob's town is characterized as a hilly area with more precipitation, likely creating more slippery conditions considerably more often. The presence of bike trails in Bob's town suggests that it's an area that attracts more bike enthusiasts, who might be more likely to ride, regardless of the weather conditions. While both towns would have cyclists, and both may have slippery conditions at times, given the characteristics described, Bob's town would likely deal with such conditions more frequently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: A group of Chinese naval vessels transited U.S. territorial waters near Alaska this week, a Pentagon official said Friday, in an unusual maneuver that underscores the potential for increased U.S.-Chinese friction at sea. A U.S. military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the Chinese naval movements, said the group of five Chinese vessels had passed within about 12 nautical miles of the Aleutian Islands after a joint Russian-Chinese military exercise. The ships did not violate international law, which allows countries to transit other nations’ seas under what is called “innocent passage,” the official said. He likened China’s movement through U.S. waters off Alaska to the activities of U.S. ships in the Strait of Hormuz, off the coast of Iran. [China to cut 300,000 soldiers, speed up military modernization] The official said the flotilla, which included three surface combatant ships, one amphibious ship and a supply ship, now appeared to be heading back to China. “By all accounts and by all indications, they’re going home,” he said. Navy Cmdr. Bill Urban, a spokesman at the Pentagon, said the ships continued out to sea into the Pacific Ocean after transiting the Aleutian Island chain. Defense officials said they did not move any Navy ships in response to China’s vessels. The Defense Department does not plan to provide additional updates on the location of the ships, indicating that Defense officials probably consider the issue resolved. The Chinese ships, whose passage through U.S. waters was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, were spotted as President Obama concluded a high-profile visit to Alaska. “This is clearly a signal,” said David Titley, a retired rear admiral who is a professor at Penn State University and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Of what, Titley said, it’s difficult to say, but he suggested that China may be seeking to establish itself as a player in growing commercial activity in the Arctic. Titley said the incident — and especially the lack of a dramatic U.S. response — could also have a softening effect on China’s position on maritime disputes in the South China Sea. [China’s Xi uses parade to show he’s in charge and pursuing national revival] As Chinese military spending grows, U.S. officials have criticized China’s aggressive stance in the South China Sea and its attempt to strengthen territorial claims by building up islands. Titley said a shrug by U.S. officials about this week’s activity in the Bering Sea may lead leaders in Beijing to ratchet down their own response to foreign presence off China. “This is how mature superpowers operate,” he said. “You don’t go to general quarters every time there’s a ship operating legally.” With China expanding its military, the United States appears willing to let it spread its wings as long as it doesn’t cross legal lines. “China is a global navy, and we encourage them and other international navies to operate in international waters as long as they adhere to safe and professional standards and maritime laws of the sea,” said Navy Cmdr. William Marks, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon. The United States has operated in international waters off China’s coast for years, especially in the South China Sea, where tensions can sometimes erupt between China and neighboring countries. In the past two months alone, at least three U.S. warships have spent time there: the USS Fort Worth, a littoral combat ship; the USS Lassen, a destroyer; and the USS Germantown, an amphibious dock landing ship. The Fort Worth participated in an exercise with Malaysia, while the Lassen worked with Singapore and the Germantown worked with Indonesia, Marks said. There are 10 Pacific Fleet ships underway in the Western Pacific, said Lt. Cmdr. Clay Doss, a Navy spokesman. None are making port visits in China now, but several have this year in places such as Zhanjiang and Hong Kong. Pacific Fleet ships routinely use international waters in the East China Sea, South China and other parts of the Pacific. Maritime patrol aircraft, such as the P-8 Poseidon, use international airspace overhead in similar fashion, Doss said. The USS Preble, a destroyer, and the USS Chancellorsville, a cruiser, were in the South China Sea last month, Doss said. “As we’ve said before, these patrols are not aimed at any particular navy, but are about promoting freedom of the seas for all navies in international waters,” he said.

Article: Desert plants fall into two sorts according to the way they deal with the problem of surviving drought. There are the drought--avoiders--those which persist  only as seeds, ready to spring up when it rains, to flower quickly and produce another crop of seeds, and to die again. There are also the drought--resisters--those which have evolved various methods for strong water, locating underground water, or reducing their need for water by such devices as shedding their leaves. The drought--resisters are perennials ,they manage to live from one rainy season to another, slowly growing bigger and bigger. Of these, the succulents  is a small but interesting fraction . They may store water in their leaves, in their stems, or in underground containers.    In the American deserts the best--known succulents are the cacti . They come in a wide range of sizes, from 50--foot tall giant saguaros  to tiny round cacti about the size of a thumb--nail. They take thick, cylindrical  or even spherical forms, thereby exposing a minimum of evaporating surface to the air and light. They are leafless, except in youth, and then the leaves are small. Typically their surfaces are spiny, discouraging thirsty animals, and channeled like an accordion , so the fleshy stem may expand quickly when the plant drinks and contract slowly as it uses up the water.

Now, new findings shed light on the role a senior News International figure played in swaying the selection process to choose the next Met Commissioner.  Sir Paul Stephenson resigned from his position in the wake of Mrs. Brooks's arrest, following revelations of phone hacking practices at the News of the World, which she had previously edited. Investigations have since uncovered that a high-ranking News International representative, whose identity has not been disclosed, secretly communicated with No 10, informing them of Mrs. Brooks's preferences for Sir Paul's replacement. It is of vital importance to note that neither Mrs. Brooks nor former deputy editor of News of the World, Neil Wallis, was the figure involved in the secret exchange. The message conveyed to No 10 disclosed that Mrs. Brooks did not want Sir Hugh Orde, the frontrunner and perceived favorite for the Met Commissioner role, to secure the position. The involvement of News International in the process raises questions regarding the media conglomerate's influence on key appointments and transparency in the UK public sector. The news also highlights the complex and murky relationships between UK's highest-ranking law enforcement officials and influential media personalities. Adding another layer to the story, it was the News of the World that exposed a deeply personal issue regarding Sir Hugh Orde. The tabloid ran a story revealing he had fathered a love child, which seemingly aimed to discredit or jeopardize his chances of becoming the Met police commissioner. Whether this was a contributing factor to Mrs. Brooks's disapproval of Sir Hugh remains uncertain, and the motivations behind her preference for someone other than Sir Hugh are unclear. The secretive communication from the News International figure and Mrs. Brooks's revealed preferences about the Met police chief position draw attention to the possible manipulation and influence of pivotal decision-making processes within law enforcement. These incidents necessitate further inquiry into the matter and raise questions about the integrity of officials, media organizations, and the Police Service as a whole. Looking ahead, it is essential for the public sector, particularly law enforcement agencies, to regain public trust and establish transparent and objective decision-making mechanisms. Transparency in appointments and impartiality must be of paramount importance, to ensure that the individuals in charge of public safety and order are chosen based on their skills, expertise, and merit rather than through covert machinations of external forces or alliances. In conclusion, the revelations about undisclosed communication between a high-ranking News International figure and No 10 demonstrate an unsettling example of media influence seeping into the selection process for pivotal law enforcement positions. The implications of these findings emphasize the importance of transparency, impartiality, and accountability in both the media and public sectors. The story of Sir Paul Stephenson's resignation and Sir Hugh Orde's exclusion from the running not only exposes the power dynamics between key law enforcement figures and media giants but also mandates an urgent need for establishing and maintaining standards of integrity in decision-making processes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This indicated that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced predominantly to the Middle East. The research discovered that the proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounted to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations. With a relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim, the total admixture estimate was found to be very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.

Movie title: Drop Zone Movie plot: Aboard a commercial airliner, U.S. Marshals Terry (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and Pete Nessip (Wesley Snipes), are escorting computer expert Earl Leedy (Michael Jeter) to a high security prison. When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew. Jessie agrees to train Pete how to skydive, if he will sponsor her team for the parachute exhibition. When Jessie's...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Whether you and your husband live together but rarely see each other, or you have a long distance marriage, it's important to talk about how you plan to make this arrangement work for you. Good communication is key to keeping your romance alive, even when you are physically apart.  The conversation should be ongoing. Check in regularly with your husband to make sure the arrangement is still working for both of you. Don't be afraid to share your feelings if you feel that something needs to change. Consider making a list of the benefits of the separation. When things get hard or you start arguing about how little you see each other, you can consult the list to help remind you about why you chose the arrangement in the first place. Your husband will miss you tons if he's always finding little reminders of you while you are apart. Before your next separation, consider hiding little treasures for him to discover. They can be anything from notes to photos of the two of you or other tokens of your affection.  If your husband is going away, you can leave him love notes in his suitcase or in the pockets of his clothing. Try to put them in places where he will discover them at different times. If you are leaving home, hide things around the house for him to find. They can be notes or small mementos of your affection, like his favorite chocolate. Phone conversations tend to be centered around recounting daily activities. While this is fine, it's not the kind of conversation that will make your husband miss you. Instead, try to think of the kinds of conversations you have in person, and recreate these over the phone.  Share something personal about yourself during each phone call. For example, you might tell your husband about something interesting you noticed today or about an activity you would like to try. You can also remind your husband of all of the things you love about him. For example, you might tell him that he's an excellent cuddler or that you love his laugh. While you may need to talk about household things, like bills or maintenance, be sure that they do no dominate the conversation. Balance them out by also talking about enjoyable topics. For example, you could tell your husband about a great movie that you saw, or you could discuss plans for a trip you plan to take together. Instead of just talking on the phone and telling each other about your days, find ways to participate in activities together. This will help remind your husband of how enjoyable it is to be with you, even if you won't get the opportunity to see each other in person for a long time.  For example, you could play an online game together, watch the same movie while talking to each other, or even bring each other to important events via video conference. If you get the chance to see your husband periodically, make that time count. You may choose to do activities together or just relax together, but no matter what you do, make sure that you both enjoy the time you have together. It's easy to get into a rut when it comes to long-distance communication. For example, if you write your husband a letter every week or speak to him on the phone every evening, it can easily become routine. Keep your husband on his toes and looking forward to your next communication by doing something a little different every once in a while. For example, you might send your husband videos or silly cards at times. Alternatively, you might recite a poem that you wrote for him the next time you speak on the phone. Try to be a little unpredictable! When you talk to your husband, try not to say anything that will make him feel bad about being apart. You want to make him miss you, and complaining about the burden he has left you with by leaving will do just the opposite.  Instead of complaining, try offering him some sweet compliments. For example, you might let him know that something he fixed before he left is working very well. This will make him realize how much you appreciate him, which will intensify his feelings for you.  If you are the one who is away from home, you could let him know that a joke he told you made you smile all day. If you want your husband to miss you while you are apart, it is vital that the time you spend together is as enjoyable as possible. Let him know that you value your time together, and he will too.  Avoid bombarding him with a to-do list if he is coming home from a long trip. Instead, take a few days to spend quality time together doing things you both enjoy. If your husband is coming home from a military deployment, consider throwing him a welcome home party or meeting him at the airport with a welcome home banner. Summary:","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of good communication and maintaining a strong emotional connection in long-distance or busy marriages through regular check-ins, sharing personal thoughts, engaging in activities together, being unpredictable in communication, offering compliments, and valuing the time spent together to keep the romance alive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Slow talking & somewhat goofy, Stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time. Often overlooked or neglected today, the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents, both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film, something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel.

A:","output":"A: \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" is a song famously sung by Tina Turner. It was written by Terry Britten and Graham Lyle, and was released as a single in 1984. The song is considered one of Tina Turner's signature tracks and was a massive hit, reaching number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and number three on the UK Singles Chart. Tina Turner, born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Nutbush, Tennessee, is an American-born Swiss singer, songwriter, and actress. She began her career in the late 1950s as a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, a duo that included her former husband Ike Turner. The pair achieved success together, both on the recording charts and as a live act, but their marriage was mired in conflict and domestic violence, as documented in her autobiography, \\"I, Tina,\\" and the subsequent film adaptation, \\"What's Love Got to Do with It.\\" Tina Turner eventually found the courage to leave Ike and pursue a solo career. Several years after their divorce, she made an astonishing comeback in the mid-1980s at the age of 45, and her career reached new heights with the release of her album \\"Private Dancer.\\" The album featured \\"What's Love Got to Do with It,\\" which became one of her most iconic songs and marked Tina Turner as a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. With powerful vocals, unmatched energy, and unique stage presence, Tina Turner earned the nickname \\"The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll.\\" Throughout her long and successful career, she has received numerous awards and accolades, including multiple Grammy Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2021, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the second time, this time as a solo artist. Her music continues to inspire and entertain fans around the world, and her story serves as an example of triumph over adversity and the power of resilience and determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the fact that:  The pupil automatically gets bigger or smaller to let more or less light in as needed.  Answer the question:   When it is day time the pupils in our eyes are more or less open than normal? The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's first determine the lighting conditions during the day and their effect on the pupil size. Step 1: Identify the lighting condition during day time. During the day, the surrounding environment is usually brighter due to sunlight. Step 2: Determine the purpose of the pupil. The pupil's main function is to control the amount of light entering the eye. Step 3: Understand how the pupil reacts in different light conditions. The pupil gets bigger (dilates) in dim lighting to allow more light to enter the eye and gets smaller (constricts) in bright lighting to limit the amount of light entering the eye. Step 4: Consider the scenario mentioned in the question: daylight conditions. As established earlier, during the day, the environment is usually brighter and has more light. Step 5: Determine how the pupil would react in a bright, daytime environment. In a bright, daylight environment, the pupil will constrict (get smaller) to reduce the amount of light entering the eye and prevent damage to sensitive photoreceptors. Conclusion: In daytime conditions, the pupils in our eyes are less open (more constricted) than normal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: Almost 80% of the Americans have stated their opposition to cloning pet animals such as cats and dogs, yet companies still try to make a business out of selling cloned pets. Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to \\"bring back\\" or \\"copy\\" a beloved companion animal. However, studies have shown that cloning remains an experimental technology with many failures. Behind each lovely picture of a cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals that were kept in lab cages, receiving bad treatment to produce just that one cloned animal. For all that, you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to appear like the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems. Also, while pet cloning companies are charging customers up to 150,000 for a cloned pet, millions of homeless animals of the same species are available in US animal shelters for around 100. Unfortunately, most of these animals are killed for lack of adopting homes. With No Pet Cloning campaign, the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) tries to protect both animals and people from harm. They campaigned until the US companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors. First it was Genetic Savings & Clone Inc. and then it was BioArts International. When BioArts was closed, its owner, Lou Hawthorne, finally had to _ the problems of pet cloning. According to Hawthorne, he has seen numerous failures during his pet cloning attempts, \\"One clone----which was supposed to be black and white----was born greenish-yellow where it should have been white (we still have no good explanation for how that happened).\\" The AAVS is educating the public about the animal suffering and is seeking regulation of cloning activities. They will continue to take the lead in protecting animals from the threats of pet cloning. Question: According to the passage, companies keep on selling cloned pets to   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"get economic interests\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"get economic interests\\" can be inferred from the passage. Companies continue to sell cloned pets in order to make a profit and maintain their business, despite opposition from a majority of Americans and the ethical concerns surrounding pet cloning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which chemical element, atomic no. 41, is named after the daughter of King Tantalus?","output":"The chemical element with atomic number 41 is Niobium. The name of this element is derived from Niobe, the daughter of the mythological King Tantalus in Greek mythology. Niobium, symbol Nb, is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, often found in the minerals such as pyrochlore and columbite. It was recognised as an element in 1801 and first isolated in its pure form in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand. Initially, it was named Columbium (Cb), but was renamed Niobium in 1949 by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) to avoid confusion with the mineral columbite.  The element's naming serves as a link to another element, Tantalum, which also occurs in columbite ores. Tantalum is named after Tantalus, Niobe's father in Greek mythology. According to the myth, Tantalus was a king who was punished by the gods for his pride and specific transgressions like stealing ambrosia. Niobe, his daughter, thought herself superior to the goddess Leto, boasting about her fourteen children. This arrogance angered the gods, who killed all her children and turned Niobe into a weeping stone, endlessly mourning her loss. Much like their mythological namesakes, the elements Niobium and Tantalum are often found together in nature and are difficult to separate due to their similar chemical properties. Niobium is mainly used in alloys, the largest amount of it used in special steels. When added to steel, Niobium improves the strength and toughness of the metal, and reduces its weight making it ideal for pipeline construction. Other major uses of Niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics and jewelry. In the last two applications, Niobium's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodization makes it a desirable choice.  Once considered a rare and precious metal, Niobium is now classified as a \\"strategic and critical\\" metal by the U.S. government, useful in a variety of defense applications. Despite this classification, the stable supply of Niobium and its compounds ensures that this element will continue to play a crucial role in the modern technological landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, let's combine the like terms (in this case, all terms related to g and all constants): -23g - 762g = -785g -11424 - 12911 = -24335 So the equation now becomes: -785g - 24335 = 0 Now, you want to isolate the term with the variable g. In this case, you can add 24335 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the subtracted constant on the left side: -785g - 24335 + 24335 = 0 + 24335 This simplifies the equation to: -785g = 24335 To solve for g, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g which is -785: (-785g) / -785 = 24335 / -785 Simplifying this gives you: g = -31.

Q: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why the author asked for more money: A:","output":"The author asked for more money to provide additional payment to the local designer, Fergus, who had experienced higher expenses and more time spent on the project than initially budgeted.

New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state; however, the state has no official language. New Mexico's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English. Although English is the state government's paper working language, government business is often conducted in Spanish, particularly at the local level. Spanish has been spoken in the New Mexico-Colorado border and the contemporary U.S.–Mexico border since the 16th century.[citation needed] Is New Mexico known for the Spanish language?","output":"Yes, New Mexico is known for its deep historical, cultural, and linguistic ties to the Spanish language. While Spanish is not an official language of the state, it has had a significant influence on various aspects of life in New Mexico. The history of Spanish in New Mexico dates back to the 16th century when Spanish explorers, including members of the Coronado expedition, first entered the region. Subsequent Spanish colonization, missions, and settlements further contributed to the spread of the Spanish language and Hispanic culture. As part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, New Mexico was governed by Spanish authorities and strongly influenced by Spanish institutions, laws, and customs. The region continued to be part of Spanish Mexico until the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. Following the Mexican-American War in 1848, New Mexico, along with other territories in the southwestern United States, were ceded to the United States. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war, guaranteed the rights of Spanish-speaking residents in these territories, ensuring that the Spanish language would continue to be widely spoken and respected. Throughout its history, New Mexico has maintained a diverse population and a unique blend of Native American, Hispanic, and Anglo influences. As a result, many New Mexicans speak Spanish and use it in their daily lives. An estimated 28% of the state's population speaks Spanish at home, and this figure is even higher in some rural areas, where families have been speaking Spanish for generations. New Mexico also has a rich tradition of literature, music, and art in Spanish, reflecting the centuries-long presence of the language in the region. Hispano folk art, music, and customs are deeply ingrained in the state's cultural identity. Spanish-language newspapers, radio, and television stations continue to thrive, offering news, entertainment, and educational content to the state's diverse population. In the realm of education, efforts are made to preserve and promote the Spanish language. This includes bilingual and dual-language programs in many New Mexico public schools, which help to maintain and strengthen the linguistic and cultural heritage of the state. Although English is the primary working language of the state government, many New Mexico government agencies recognize the importance of Spanish and provide bilingual services to constituents. This includes translating official documents and forms, as well as offering interpretation services in various settings. In conclusion, while New Mexico does not have an official state language, it is widely recognized for its strong relationship with the Spanish language. This connection arises from New Mexico's long history of Spanish colonization, its diverse population, and its commitment to preserving and promoting its Hispanic cultural and linguistic heritage."},{"instruction":"Word Power   Author(s): Kaplan   13.95  You'll never be at a loss for words again.

Article: In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand   with a small notepad   and a hole for a pencil. I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely  the original one. \\"I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years.\\" I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. \\"You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?\\" My mother replies a little sharply. \\"It works perfectly  well. I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days.\\" Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, \\"One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on.\\" This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Tony Rivers, a troubled teenager at Rockdale High, is known for losing his temper and overreacting. A campus fight between Tony and classmate Jimmy gets the attention of the local police, Det. Donovan in particular. Donovan breaks up the fight and advises Tony to talk with a \\"psychologist\\" that works at the local aircraft plant, Dr. Alfred Brandon, a practitioner of hypnotherapy. Tony declines, but his girlfriend Arlene, as well as his widowed father, show concern about his violent behavior. Later, at a Halloween party at the \\"haunted house\\", an old house at which several of the teenagers hang out, Tony attacks his friend Vic after being surprised from behind. After seeing the shocked expressions on his friends's faces, he realizes he needs help and goes to see Dr. Brandon. On Tony's first visit, however, Brandon makes it clear that he has his own agenda while the teenager lies on the psychiatrist's couch: Tony will be an excellent subject for his experiments with a scopolamine serum he has developed that regresses personalities to their primitive instincts. Brandon believes that the only future that mankind has is to \\"hurl him back to his primitive state.\\" Although Brandon's assistant, Dr. Hugo Wagner, protests that the experiment might kill Tony, Brandon continues and within two sessions suggests to Tony that he was once a wild animal.

At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul announced his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said that each of them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing either of the two main parties' candidates (McCain - Republican Party, or Obama - Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the \\"charade\\" that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process.

Treaties can be loosely compared to contracts: both are means of willing parties assuming obligations among themselves, and a party to either that fails to live up to their obligations can be held liable under international law. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Under what will a party to a treaty be held liable for failing to uphold their obligations?","output":"A party to a treaty can be held liable for failing to uphold their obligations under several circumstances. Here is a step-by-step thought process: Step 1: Determine if there has been a breach of the treaty A breach occurs when a party violates the terms of the treaty. The breach can be material or minor depending on the significance of the violated provision. Step 2: Establish the responsibility of the party To hold a party liable for failing to uphold their obligations, it must be demonstrated that the breach was attributable to that party. This typically involves showing that the party acted or failed to act in a manner required by the treaty. Step 3: Establish a causal link between the breach and the damage caused To hold a party liable, it must be proven that the breach of their obligations caused harm or damage to other parties or to the purpose of the treaty. A clear relationship between the breach and the ensuing harm is necessary for establishing liability. Step 4: Determine if there are any exceptions or defenses A party may not be held liable if there are recognized exceptions or defenses under international law. Examples include force majeure or necessity, where external circumstances beyond a party's control prevented them from upholding their obligations, or if they acted in self-defense. Step 5: Evaluate the appropriate remedies or sanctions When a party is found liable for failing to uphold their obligations under a treaty, remedies or sanctions could be applied. This may include demanding the party to cease the wrongful act, providing reparations for damage caused, or imposing penalties such as economic sanctions or diplomatic measures. In conclusion, under international law, a party to a treaty can be held liable for failing to uphold their obligations under circumstances where there is a clear breach attributable to the party, a causal link between the breach and damage caused, and the absence of any exceptions or defenses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, answer the following question. How many grams of protein per kilo does the author probably eat? Select from: i.

Dixy Lee Ray (September 3, 1914 - January 2, 1994) was an American scientist and politician who served as the 17th Governor of the U.S. state of Washington. Variously described as idiosyncratic, and \\"ridiculously smart,\\" she was the state's first female governor and was governor during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. She was a supporter of atomic energy. A graduate of Mills College and Stanford University, where she earned a doctorate in biology, Ray became an associate professor at the University of Washington in 1957. To the surprise of many, Ray announced in 1975 she would seek election as Governor of Washington. Later asked why she decided to make her first run for public office the highest office in the state, she would reason that \\"I was much too old to start at the bottom, so I decided to start at the top.\\" Though previously politically unaffiliated, she declared herself a Democrat.  Ray displayed a blunt, sometimes confrontational, style on the campaign trail, for which she would later become known. During a visit with the Dorian Society, a Seattle gay rights group, she was asked by one member if she had met any gay federal employees and if they ever felt under pressure. Ray responded, \\"I don't know any - you can't tell by looking at them,\\" drawing applause from attendees. In another instance, she declared Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Shelby Scates, who had deluged her with tough questions on the campaign trail, would \\"learn what the words persona non grata really mean\\" after her election.

Robert Burns, the son of a hard-working and intelligent farmer, was the oldest of seven children. Although always hard pressed financially, their father encouraged his sons with their education. As a result, Burns not only read the Scottish poetry of Ramsay and the collections by Hailes and Herd, but also the works of Pope, Locke, and Shakespeare. By 1781, Burns had tried his hand at several agricultural jobs without success. Although he had begun writing, and his poems were spread widely in manuscript  , none were published until 1786, when Burns published Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786), which was an immediate success. Later Burns brought out a second edition of his poems at Edinburgh in 1787, and for two winters he was socially active in the Scottish city. In 1788 he retired to a farm at Ellis land. By 1791 Burns had failed as a farmer, and he moved to Dumfries, where he held a position as a tax collector. He died of illness at 37. Burns's art is at its best in songs such as My Heart's in the Highlands. Some of his songs, such as Auld Lang Syne and Comin' thro' the Rye, are among the most familiar and best-loved songs in the English language. But his talent was not limited to songs; two descriptive pieces, Tam o' Shanter and The Jolly Beggars, are among his masterpieces. Burns had a fine sense of humor, which was reflected in his satirical  , descriptive, and playful poems.

Soaks the clothes: The woman will allow the clothes to soak in water for a while, usually around 20-30 minutes, to help further loosen the dirt and allow the detergent to work more effectively. 5. Rinses the clothes: After soaking, she will rinse the clothes with clean water to remove soap and dirt. She may need to do this several times to ensure all soap and dirt are rinsed out. 6. Wring out excess water: The woman will wring out the clothes to remove as much water as possible, making them easier to dry. She will be careful not to damage any delicate fabrics while doing this. 7. Hangs clothes to dry: Finally, the woman will hang the clothes out to dry, either on a clothesline or a drying rack, ensuring they are well-spaced for proper air circulation and faster drying. She will also hang certain clothes, like sweaters and delicate fabrics, in a manner that prevents stretching or damage. 8. Waits for the clothes to dry: Depending on the weather, it may take several hours to a full day for the clothes to completely dry. The woman would need to be patient and wait for this process to complete before she can move on to folding and putting the clothes away. 9. Removes dried clothes: After confirming that all the clothes are dry, the woman will start removing them from the clothesline or drying rack. 10. Folds and stores the clothes: Finally, the woman will fold and properly store the clothes in closets, drawers, or storage bins, organizing them by type and color for easy access."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Vaikka perusperiaate koskee kaikkia eläimiä, keskitymme erityisesti niiden eläinten hyvinvointiin, jotka tuotetaan lihantuotantoon tai lihotettaviksi. Tämä sisältää eläimet, jotka kasvatetaan teurastusta varten, samoin kuin ne, jonka tarkoitus on lopulta päätyä elintarvikkeiksi kuluttajien keskuudessa.  Eläinten hyvinvointi on olennainen tekijä kestävässä ja vastuullisessa eläintuotannossa. Sen varmistaminen, että kaikki eläimet saavat tarvitsemansa hoivan ja kohtelun, on ensisijainen tehtävä sekä eettisistä syistä että tuotannon tehokkuuden ja laadun kannalta. Eläinten kohtelun ja hyvinvoinnin parantamiseen tähtäävät toimenpiteet voivat sisältää monia eri osa-alueita, kuten asianmukaisen ruokinnan, terveydenhoidon, yhdessä elävien eläinten sosiaalisen järjestelmän, eläinten olot ja mahdollisuuden käyttäytyä luonnollisella tavalla. Kun nämä tekijät otetaan huomioon, niin teurastettaviksi menevät eläimet kuin lihotettavatkin voivat kokea paremman elämänlaadun ja hyvinvoinnin. Suomen maatalouden ja eläintuotannon alalla noudatetaan tiukkoja lakeja ja määräyksiä eläinten hyvinvoinnista, ja monissa tapauksissa ne ylittävät EU:n asettamat vähimmäisvaatimukset. Tämä osoittaa, että eläinten kohteluun ja hyvinvointiin kiinnitetään Suomessa erityistä huomiota, ja viljelijät pyrkivät jatkuvasti parantamaan eläinten elämää. Tuotantoeläinten hyvinvoinnin parantamisen lisäksi on tärkeää muistaa, että myös kotieläinten ja lemmikkien hyvinvointi on olennainen osa vastuullista eläinten käsittelyä ja hoivaa. Kuten maataloudessa, myös kotona tapahtuvassa eläinten hoidossa on noudatettava tiettyjä säädöksiä ja suosituksia, jotta varmistetaan eläinten tarpeiden tyydyttäminen ja hyvinvoinnin ylläpito. Tämä sisältää paitsi eläinten perustarpeiden, kuten ruoan, veden, suojan ja terveydenhoidon, myös niiden psykososiaalisen hyvinvoinnin ja elinympäristön huomioon ottamisen. Kaiken kaikkiaan eläinten, niin teurastettaviksi menevien kuin lihotettavien, hyvinvoinnin täytyy olla etusijalla, jotta voidaan turvata kestävä ja eettinen eläintuotanto sekä korkea elämänlaatu kaikille eläimille. Suomessa tämä periaate on jo tunnustettu, mutta jatkuva työ ja uusien käytäntöjen omaksuminen ovat tarpeen eläinten hyvinvoinnin takaamiseksi pitkällä aikavälillä."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Write some highlights for the following article: Jourdan Dunn has been revealed as the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years. The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers after speculation on Twitter today. She wrote: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' Scroll down for video... Jourdan Dunn posted her first Vogue cover to her Instagram account. Jourdan recently starred at the Victoria's Secret show in London. She added: 'Thank you Patrick Demarchelier and Kate Phelan for making this happen and also thank you all for the Love and Support it means everything to me #2015YearOfTheDunn.' The model used a string of kissing face emojis to highlight her joy. Patrick Demarchelier is a famed fashion photographer whilst Kate Phelan is an esteemed stylist. The cover, which is for the February 2015 issue, shows a simple shot of Jourdan looking stunning sitting in the sunshine in a short summer dress. Jourdan poses alongside her gorgeous Victoria's Secret model pals in matching leather jackets. Jourdan previously graced the front cover of Vogue in November 2008 alongside Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark. Although this is her first solo Vogue cover, Jourdan did previously front the magazine in 2008 along with Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark. This also marks a change for the fashion bible as it is the first time they have featured a solo black model on the cover since Naomi Campbell appeared in 2002. One hundred and forty six covers have been and gone since her natural, jeans and a white vest shoot. And the disparity hasn't gone unnoticed, with Naomi Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison writing an open letter to the publication in September 2013, urging them to acknowledge in the time lapsed since the last solo cover for a black Brit. They wrote: 'No matter the intention, the result is racism. Not accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond aesthetic.' Jourdan has previously revealed her struggles in the industry having been turned away from shows who told her they didn't want, 'any more black girls.' She said in an interview last year: 'I want to talk about what goes on. A lot of people are scared to speak up. It has been twelve years since the last solo black model, a fresh faced Naomi Campbell, was featured on the cover of the magazine. Jourdan has enjoyed a highly successful career so far and has been the face of Burberry beauty along with Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell. 'The people who control the industry … say if you have a black face on a magazine cover it won't sell, but there's no real evidence for that. It's lazy.' Now the star is following in her idol's footsteps by putting an end to the 12-year void for models of colour to appear on the cover. Beyonce and Rihanna are among the 58 celebrities to feature on the covers of British Vogue in that time, while Jourdan finally succeeds Naomi among the 95 covers that showed models. This is the latest in a string of good news for the model. At the beginning of last month she took a highly successful turn on the Victoria's Secret runway as the show hit London for the first time. Then in mid December it was revealed that Jourdan and Naomi Campbell were the faces of Burberry's Spring / Summer 2015 campaign. She said of the shoot: 'This campaign is even more special for me because I was shot with Naomi Campbell for the first time - someone who I admire and respect within the fashion industry.' Jourdan posed in September 2013 with some of her model pals including Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Georgia May Jagger and Clara Paget. Jourdan began her career at an early age after being spotted in a Hammersmith Primark in 2006 - she was signed to Storm Model Management not long after. Mother to a five-year-old son named Riley, Jourdan has previously worked for designers such as Calvin Klein, Balmain and Topshop. She is also a firm favourite on the fashion party circuit counting Cara Delevigne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger amongst her close friends. Last year, Forbes announced that she was the 10th highest paid model, making an estimated 4m last year and beating world-renowned beauty Cara, who earned 3.5m. Rihanna has previously fronted the magazine in 2011, however, she was the only black cover star for the whole year.

What is the best way to: tack","output":"The term \\"tack\\" is a sailing term that refers to changing the boat's direction when sailing against the wind, so that the wind shifts from one side of the boat to the other. The purpose of tacking is to move the boat forward as efficiently and quickly as possible. Tacking requires a combination of wind awareness, boat handling skills, and communication between crew members. Here is a comprehensive guide on how to tack smoothly and efficiently: 1. Assess the conditions: First of all, check the wind direction, strength, and the changes in wind speed and direction. Look for other boats, buoys, or any obstacles in the water, as you'll need to avoid them when tacking. Make a plan for when and where you want to tack, considering how far you want to sail on each tack and the exact course you want to follow. 2. Prepare the boat: Ensure that all the sheets (lines that control the sails) are well-cleated and secured. Center the boat's weight by positioning the crew members evenly on both sides of the boat. This will help maintain balance and control during the tacking maneuver. 3. Communication: Ensure that the crew members are aware of the plan and understand their roles in the tacking process. The helmsman should give a clear signal, such as saying \\"Ready to tack,\\" and wait for each crew member's response to ensure they are prepared. 4. Begin the tack: When everyone is ready, the helmsman will initiate the tack by moving the tiller or turning the wheel towards the wind. This action begins to turn the boat's bow through the wind. 5. Release the jib sheet: As the bow of the boat crosses the eye of the wind (the point where the wind is directly ahead), the crew member in charge of the jib sheet should release it from the cleat. The jib is now free to move across the boat to its new position on the other side. 6. Mind the mainsail: During the tack, the mainsail will shift from one side of the boat to the other. The crew should duck to avoid contact with the boom, which can swing across the cockpit quickly and forcefully. 7. Shift body weight: As the boat's bow crosses through the wind, crew members should shift their body weight to the opposite side of the boat to help maintain balance and stability. This also aids in accelerating the boat on the new tack. 8. Trim the jib on the new side: Once the jib has crossed the boat, the crew member should take the new jib sheet and begin to pull it in, trimming the sail to catch the wind effectively. The goal is to create an optimal sail shape that maximizes speed and efficiency on the new tack. 9. Straighten the helm: As the boat settles onto the new tack, the helmsman should gradually release pressure on the tiller or wheel, allowing the boat to find its new sailing angle relative to the wind. 10. Optimize sail trim: Once the boat is sailing on the new tack, fine-tune the sail trim by adjusting the jib and mainsail sheets for maximum performance. Observe the telltales on the sails to assess proper airflow and sail shape, making adjustments as needed. 11. Adjust the course: Ensure the course is aligned with your intended sailing route and make any necessary adjustments to maintain that course. Continue monitoring the wind conditions, boat speed, and other factors to optimize your sail plan and performance. Remember, practice is key to achieving smooth and efficient tacks. Spend time on the water, rehearsing the steps and refining your technique, and soon, tacking will become a seamless part of your sailing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Norwegian authorities have allowed flights to resume if new safety conditions are met. BP said it will wait for the completion of the AIBN and Airbus investigation. Total E&P UK also confirmed that they have no immediate plans to bring the Super Puma models back into service and said the Sikorsky S92 helicopter fulfilled its operational requirements. Unite said it was \\"very disappointed and very angry\\" that the CAA made its decision to lift the ban before knowing the cause of the crash. The union's regional organiser in Aberdeen, Tommy Campbell, said: \\"we need to know the root cause analysis of the accident in Norway last year and we still haven't got the answers to that so we think it's very inappropriate that the ban should be lifted.\\" Yesterday a North sea offshore worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC Scotland that he would dread travelling in the helicopters again and he would not be able to tell his family if he had to fly in one. But the CAA said that helicopters would not begin flying immediately and that a plan of checks, modifications and inspections will be undertaken before any flights take place. These include: CAA head of airworthiness John McColl said: \\"This is not a decision we have taken lightly.

Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.  and the situation: Keith was reading a book on climate. He found an interesting table that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two different times, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's climatic condition in the previous century. And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century.  Answer the following question: Which period would be more harmful for habitat of species, time A or time B? Answer:","output":"Time B would be more harmful for the habitat of species, as it represents the present century during which Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F) due to increased use of fossil fuels like coal and oil, contributing to global warming and causing destruction of species' habitats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - eat cake - responsibility - resentment - controversy - go to jail The answer to this question is:","output":"resentment and controversy. Judging something wrong can lead to both resentment and controversy. When we judge or criticize someone's actions or decisions as wrong, we are expressing our disapproval or disagreement with them. This can cause resentment, which is a feeling of anger or bitterness towards the person who made the judgment. Resentment may occur for a variety of reasons. For example, the person being judged might feel hurt or attacked, especially if the judgment is personal or harsh. They may see the judgment as an unfair assessment of their character, choices, or actions. Additionally, the person making the judgment may not have enough context or understanding of the situation to make an accurate or fair assessment. This could lead to even greater resentment from the individual being judged. Furthermore, when we judge something wrong, it can lead to controversy. Controversy arises because there may be differing opinions or perspectives on what is considered right or wrong. People may passionately argue about their beliefs and opinions, which can result in heated discussions, debates, or even conflicts. Controversy can have both positive and negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. Positively, it can prompt a dialogue that educates and raises awareness about important issues. Through such discussions, people can examine their own beliefs and opinions and potentially develop a deeper understanding of the issue. On the other hand, controversy can lead to negative consequences, such as creating divides among individuals, groups, or communities. In some cases, it may even result in hostility or violence when tensions escalate out of control. Additionally, constant exposure to controversial topics or judgments can cause mental and emotional stress for some individuals, affecting their overall well-being. In conclusion, when judging something as wrong, it can lead to both resentment and controversy. Depending on the situation and how the judgment is communicated and received, the outcome can be constructive by encouraging dialogue and growth, or destructive by generating anger, hostility, and division. It is essential to consider the potential consequences before making judgments and strive to communicate our opinions in an understanding, respectful and informed manner."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Since","output":"the early days of human civilization, storytelling has always been an essential aspect of our existence. It is a reflection of our need to communicate, to understand the world around us, and to tap into our creative instincts. Stories, whether through spoken language, writing, or visual mediums, have allowed us to transcend physical and cultural boundaries by providing a means of sharing our experiences, thoughts, and emotions. They have also provided an avenue for learning, entertainment, and cultural preservation. Over the millennia, the way we tell stories has evolved, but the essence of storytelling remains the same - to share our experiences and foster a sense of belonging. Traveling bards and oral historians ensured that past events, myths, and legends were preserved and taught to aim at the general populace. Their tales often held moral or cautionary messages, offering valuable lessons and wisdom across generations. With the invention of writing, stories took on new life. Epic poems, such as Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey,\\" communicated the grandeur of ancient Greece and its heroic past. The works of revered playwrights like Shakespeare brought tales of romance, tragedy, and political intrigue into the public consciousness. Books, scrolls, and manuscripts contained the knowledge and wisdom of countless cultures, making them accessible to the learned classes and, eventually, the general public. As technology advanced, the mediums through which we tell stories expanded and adapted. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century enabled mass production of written works, dramatically increasing accessibility to the average person. Newspapers, magazines, and novels made it easier than ever to stay informed, entertained, and inspired. The 20th century saw the birth of film and television, offering new visual and auditory avenues for storytelling. Today, we consume stories in every medium imaginable, from blockbuster movies and binge-worthy streaming series to captivating podcasts, YouTube videos, and immersive video games. Regardless of format, storytelling remains an essential human undertaking rooted in our need to connect, empathize, and learn from one another. Here are some key aspects of storytelling that highlights its impact on our lives. 1. Emotional connections: Stories enable us to connect on a deeper emotional level with others, fostering empathy, compassion, and understanding. They enable us to experience others' perspectives and learn from their experiences. 2. Shared culture and history: Through storytelling, we preserve our collective past, giving future generations insight into the lives, achievements, and challenges faced by their ancestors. This shared understanding helps communities to maintain their identity and cultural heritage. 3. Instruction and moral guidance: Many stories, from ancient fables and parables to modern novels and films, offer moral lessons. They encourage us to reflect on our actions and consider the consequences of our choices. 4. Creativity and imagination: Storytelling provides an outlet for creativity and imagination, allowing us to explore new worlds, engage in thought experiments, and consider alternative possibilities. This enrichment of the mind also enhances problem-solving skills and adaptability. 5. Entertainment and relaxation: Stories provide an escape from our everyday lives, giving us the opportunity to unwind, recharge, and lose ourselves in different worlds and characters. In conclusion, storytelling is an integral part of the human experience. From its humble beginnings in oral traditions to its current status as a multi-billion-dollar global industry, stories have always had the power to educate, entertain, and inspire. Our constant thirst for new stories and innovative ways to share them demonstrates that storytelling will continue to evolve and flourish, shaping the world and the human experience for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

There are two doctors in the entire county. I don't mean two doctors to treat Ebola patients but two doctors, period.  Two doctors to take care of Ebola patients, plus the 100 patients in their general hospital, plus the rest of the county. That's two doctors for about 85,000 people.  Logan doesn't complain, even though he's been working around the clock since June, when the first Ebola case appeared in this agricultural county.  He would, however, like an actual Ebola treatment center. He's been taking care of patients in a holding facility, which has only 12 beds. Sometimes they have nearly double that number, and patients overflow onto mattresses on the floor.  He can't send these patients to real Ebola treatment centers because they're all full.  Ebola outbreak: How to help  Logan has been begging the federal government for more than a month for an official Ebola treatment unit, one with more beds and a quarantine area for people who've come in close contact with Ebola patients but aren't sick.  My team and I -- senior producer John Bonifield, senior photographer Orlando Ruiz and our coordinator, Liberian journalist Orlind Cooper -- saw firsthand Tuesday night just how much he needs a real hospital.

There is no action-movie cliché too rusty to be wheeled forth. 9. The great thing about monsters is that they glide noiselessly from nightmare straight into myth, fully formed and eternally mysterious. To know what made them is to explain them. And once you explain anything, you begin to lose your fear of it. 10. Hannibal Lecter does not need a creation story; he just needs to go away. The meal is over.

Question: Given the following context:  The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward.

Title: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso Movie plot: In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood. It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector. The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of ViggiÃ¹ after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, still a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines. About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help â advice that Alfredo often...

He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages would be the last to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy.

So here's an amazing little guide that'll help you turn your messy room into a sparkling clean kingdom. And it all begins with four magical steps! Step 1: Welcome the Breezy Box Fan Find a box fan, which is a big square fan that spins super fast and blows lots of air. Place it in the window of your room. Make sure the window is open! By doing this, the fan will help blow away all the yucky dust and icky smells out of your room. It's like inviting a gentle wind inside to sweep away all the dirt. Step 2: Save Your Furniture from Dust Monsters Dust monsters love to hide on your furniture. These little monsters are too tiny to see, but they can make your room look and feel dirty. That's why it's important to save your furniture from them by removing and covering it.  To remove the furniture, you can simply slide it away from the middle of the room. Now, cover the rest of your furniture with large sheets, like a superhero cape. That way, you'll protect them from dust attacks while cleaning the rest of the room. Step 3: Sweep, Sweep, Sweep the Dust Away Now that your furniture is safe, it's time to gather all the dust monsters in the center of the room. Grab a broom or a floor brush and start sweeping. Pretend you're a brave knight, gathering all the dust bunnies and sending them to dust bunny jail in the middle of the room. This way, the dust won't spread around your room while you're cleaning. Step 4: Suck up the Dust with a Shop Vac A Shop Vac is a super-duper vacuum cleaner made especially for sucking up big piles of dust and dirt. Now that you've got all the dust bunnies in the middle of the room, it's time to use the Shop Vac! Turn it on, and watch as the dust bunnies are sucked into the vacuum cleaner. Wave goodbye to the dust bunnies as they leave your room and promise never to return (until your room gets dusty again). And that's it, my young friends! With these four magical steps, you've turned your room into a sparkling clean castle, where you can play, read, or take a nap without worrying about the dust monsters. Always remember to ask for help from an adult, like a parent or a guardian, to make sure you do it safely. Happy cleaning!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

A desperate Helen went to Karim Lala , who asked her to meet Dilip Kumar . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, as they describe two different sequences of events with different interactions taking place. Let's examine each sentence in detail to understand the differences between them. In Sentence 1: \\"A desperate Helen went to Dilip Kumar , who told her to meet Karim Lala.\\" Here, Helen is in a desperate situation and approaches Dilip Kumar. Dilip Kumar advises Helen to meet Karim Lala, which implies that he thinks Karim Lala can provide the help or information Helen is seeking. In Sentence 2: \\"A desperate Helen went to Karim Lala , who asked her to meet Dilip Kumar.\\" In this sentence, Helen is still desperate, but she chooses to approach Karim Lala instead. Karim Lala directs Helen to meet Dilip Kumar, suggesting that he believes Dilip Kumar can assist Helen to resolve her predicament. From the analysis of both sentences, we can deduce that they are not paraphrases, as the order of events is different, as well as the roles of Dilip Kumar and Karim Lala in each scenario. In the first sentence, Helen approaches Dilip Kumar first, whereas, in the second sentence, she goes to Karim Lala first. Similarly, Dilip Kumar suggests meeting Karim Lala in the first sentence, but Karim Lala suggests meeting Dilip Kumar in the second sentence. To summarize, these sentences are not paraphrases of each other because they present differing sequences of events and varied interactions between the characters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Batman Returns Movie plot: On a snowy Christmas night, Tucker and Esther Cobblepot throw their deformed infant child Oswald into Gotham River, fearing he would become a menace to society after attacking their pet cat. His crib floats to an abandoned zoo and is found by a flock of penguins who raise him as one of their own. 33 years later, during the lighting of Gotham City's Christmas tree, a villainous gang of carnival performers stage a riot. While Batman subdues the criminals, corrupt businessman Max Shreck falls through a trapdoor and is brought to the underground lair of Osward himself; who is now the grotesquely nefarious kingpin known as The Penguin. A former sideshow freak, The Penguin explains his desire to become a respected citizen of Gotham and blackmails Shreck into helping him. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, inadvertently discovers her boss's plan to illegally monopolize Gotham's supply of electricity. To protect his secrets, Shreck pushes her out of his office window. Falling through several canopies, Selina miraculously survives but lies unconscious in an alley. A group of cats swarm around her, and while attempting to eat her, they revive her, gifting her with eight more lives. Traumatized, Selina develops dissociative identity disorder and, after having a mental breakdown and trashing her apartment, she fashions a black vinyl costume and whip, becoming the formidable Catwoman. Shreck arranges for one of Penguin's men to kidnap the Mayor's infant son, allowing the Penguin to \\"rescue\\" him. As a reward, the Penguin is given access to the Gotham City Archives, where he learns his real name, and that he is the last surviving member of his family. Meanwhile, the Mayor, persuaded by Bruce Wayne, refuses to give Shreck a construction permit for his power plant. The Penguin orders his gang to attack downtown Gotham, ruining the Mayor's reputation and giving Shreck the opportunity to propose Penguin as a replacement.

Sentence from a movie review: long and tedious  Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Available options:  A). negative;  B). positive;","output":"Based on the sentence from the movie review, the movie was seen negatively. Option A) is therefore the correct choice.  The words \\"long\\" and \\"tedious\\" describe experiences that most people generally regard as negative, especially in the context of a movie review. When a movie is described as \\"long,\\" the implied critique generally pertains to the pacing and the runtime, suggesting that the film may outstay its welcome or feel over-extended.  Moreover, the adjective \\"tedious\\" further underscores the negative impression of the movie. \\"Tedious\\" means tiresome because of length or dullness, so it implies that the film was not only long but also boring or monotonous. A viewer might experience boredom if the plot is uninteresting, character development is poor, or visuals are unimpressive. When a movie is viewed positively, reviewers typically use adjectives like \\"engaging,\\" \\"exciting,\\" \\"innovative\\" or \\"thought-provoking.\\" These words indicate an immerse, captivating, and enjoyable experience. Contrastingly, the reviewer in this case uses \\"long and tedious\\", which suggests dissatisfaction and a less than pleasurable viewing experience.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Like most people, you probably feel the drive to make more money, get more things, and look better. However, extraordinary people realize that these things don't matter as much as learning to focus on the things that make you truly happy.  For instance, being in a relationship with people you love and trust is important, and that doesn't have to be sexual. Friendships can be just as important as having a lifetime partner. You just need to be with people that you trust enough to be emotionally vulnerable with. This step also means valuing experiences over things. Things just fill up your house, while experiences make you feel alive and invigorated. Part of what makes life enjoyable is the experiences you have, from eating a fabulous dinner to watching a sunrise to taking a painting class. When life gets busy, you're likely to find excuses not to have new experiences, as everyone does. But making sure you take the time to get out and try new things is integral to making you an extraordinary person.  Think of it this way. When you think of extraordinary people, do you think of someone who sits at home every night? No, extraordinary people have extraordinary and interesting experiences. Start making plans. Decide you're going to try at least one new thing a week, and stick to it. Making plans with other people can help you stick to it. Also, don't be afraid to be spontaneous. Feel like going to the beach? Take a mental health day from work and take that three hour drive down to the beach. Sure, you'll be tired at the end of the day, but you'll also feel exhilarated and more alive. Just like the experiences you have, your passions help make your life fuller and you a more interesting person. Following your passions helps engage your curiosity and keep your spark of life alive.  Maybe you've lost touch with your love of painting, but it used to make you happy. Try picking it up again. Join a club in your area, or find a class at your local community college. If you're not sure what you're really passionate about, start exploring interests. Check out books from the library on hobbies and ideas that catch your attention, or start taking community college classes that catch your interest. If you hear about an event that piques your interest, go to it to see what it's about. Sometimes, when that moment of pure joy comes around, you may find yourself not giving into it. You're holding back a bit because you're afraid of when the next bad thing is going to hit. However, learning to really dig down into joyfulness can make you a more joyful person overall, and in turn, a more extraordinary person, as few people are able to live joyfully. The next time you find yourself in a happy situation, take some time to be in the moment. Let yourself fill up with the emotion. Take in the joy on the faces of people around you. Savor the sensations of the food you're eating or the feeling of sand and water between your toes. Gratitude is sometimes hard when life throws curve balls at you left and right. Nonetheless, being grateful is another way to learn how to live an extraordinary life because it helps you appreciate what you have and what's most important to you, a rare quality.  One way you can learn gratitude is to take time each day to think or write about things you are grateful for. You could write down 3 things each day in a journal that you are thankful for or even post 3 things you are grateful for on social media every day for your friends to see. You could also just take time each night to think about the things you are grateful for in your life. Express your gratitude. When you're thankful for a person or what they've done, tell that person. Writing a note is even better, because it makes you take time to really feel that gratitude. Plus, it lets the other person know they are appreciated.","output":"Most people want more money and things, but being happy is more important. It's good to be close with friends and do fun things together, like trying new activities every week. This makes you an interesting person. You can also be creative by doing things like painting. Enjoying the happy moments and feeling grateful for what you have can make your life more amazing. Remember to say thank you to people who help you. So, to be special and happy, spend time with friends, try new things, and always be thankful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also, most of earthquake deaths happen after the earthquake, so remember that the danger does not end when the shaking does! If you stay indoors during an earthquake, move away from unsupported areas and windows. Try to get under a doorway or another area of the building which is held up by strong beams .  Stay under a table or desk only if it is very strong. Do not rush to lifts, because it is far safer to stay where you are.

Don't move to buildings, electric poles and other objects which may fall during an earthquake and injure you. Protect your head and stay low to the ground till the shaking ends and it is safe to move. After an earthquake, many buildings are less strong, although they appear safe.

The sentiment in a review is determined by the emotions normally associated with the words and phrases used. In this case, the reviewer uses words and phrases with a negative connotation. First, the word \\"mediocre\\" is used to classify the overall quality of the service or product. This term is seldom used in a positive context and indicates insufficiency or subpar standard.  Next, the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the preparation of the crab legs, saying that they are boiled to the point of becoming mush which indicates overcooking and poor food quality. Terms such as “typical buffet experience” and “store-bought cake desserts” are used to give off a feeling of commonness and lack of uniqueness about the restaurant's offerings.  The price is also addressed as being overpriced with the specific mention of \\"18 for frozen seafood.\\" Highlighting the expensive nature of a subpar product carries an inherently negative sentiment.

Answer based on context: Coming off their home win over the Colts, the Eagles flew to FedExField for a Week 10 NFC East rematch with the Washington Redskins on Monday night.  Philadelphia wasted no time kicking off the first quarter as on the very first play of the game, quarterback Michael Vick found wide receiver DeSean Jackson on an 88-yard touchdown pass.  Afterwards, the Eagles added onto their lead with Vick's 7-yard touchdown run, followed by Vick finding running back LeSean McCoy on an 11-yard touchdown pass, along with running back Jerome Harrison's 50-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia continued its dominating night in the second quarter as Vick hooked up with wide receiver Jeremy Maclin on a 48-yard touchdown pass.  The Redskins would answer with former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to fullback Darrel Young, followed by a 3-yard touchdown pass to running back Keiland Williams.  Philadelphia responded with Vick's 6-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker David Akers booting a 48-yard field goal. Washington began the third quarter with Williams getting a 4-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, the Eagles went back to work as Vick hooked up with wide receiver Jason Avant on a 3-yard touchdown pass, followed by cornerback Dimitri Patterson returning an interception 40 yards for a touchdown.  The Redskins tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Williams got a 32-yard touchdown run, but Philadelphia's defense (combined with their 31-point lead) held on to preserve the victory. The Philadelphia Eagles scored 59 points and 8 touchdowns, including 4 passing TDs, 3 rushing TDs and They racked up 592 yards of total offense, including 260 rushing yards and 332 passing yards. They were 4/4 in Red Zone Efficiency and 4/4 in Goal-to-Go Efficiency, were 8/13 in Third-Down Conversions and had 28 first downs. Michael Vick (20/28, 333 yards, 4 TDs, 8 carries, 80 yards, 2 TDs) became the first player in NFL history to have 300+ yards passing, 50+ yards rushing, 4+ passing touchdowns, and 2+ rushing touchdowns in the same game.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Russians blame Kiev government for MH17 disaster, not Ukrainian rebels A woman places flowers at the Dutch embassy in Moscow in tribute to those killed on flight MH17. Photograph: RYuri Kochetkov/EPA A trickle of well-wishers continued to lay flowers outside the Dutch embassy in Moscow on Sunday at a makeshift shrine to the victims of the MH17 crash. Several notes among the bouquets and teddy bears read \\"forgive us\\". The majority of Russians, however, do not appear to blame the shooting down of the plane on their government and the eastern Ukraine rebels the country has been accused of sponsoring, but rather on the pro-western Ukrainian government in Kiev. An English teacher who would give her name only as Tatiana, said she had laid flowers because she was ashamed of her government, which she suspected provided weapons to the pro-Russian rebels who are thought to have downed the plane. \\"I feel like it's state terrorism, a government who supports terrorists,\\" she said. Natasha, a corporate PR specialist, said: \\"We represent an opposition point of view, but I think it's [the rebels'] mistake, not being able to use the weapons that fell into their hands.\\" But several other people on Moscow's Arbat pedestrian street suspected a Ukrainian or US plot. Media outlets including the state-controlled television channels have raised a variety of explanations for the MH17 tragedy, including now-debunked theories that Ukrainian fighter jets had shot down the plane or that Kiev's air defence was trying to shoot down Vladimir Putin's jet. Rebel leaders have claimed that they don't have weapons capable of hitting such a plane, even though Russian media previously reported separatist militia had seized Buk missile launchers like the one widely believed to have been used. \\"I think the Americans did it,\\" said dog-breeder Natasha Kovalyova. \\"They want to write Russia into this, but it's their work.\\" Russia is not helping the rebels, she added. \\"If it is, it's only with volunteers and medicine.\\" Her partner Konstantin said he suspected Kiev's forces. \\"I don't think it was an accident. It was done deliberately so Europe would deploy troops, so Nato would come to the aid of Ukraine.\\" Roza Velgan, an elderly flower seller, said she knew \\"for sure\\" that Ukrainian forces shot down the plane, and that the rebels \\"don't have such weapons\\". \\"Russia is not doing any harm to anyone,\\" she said. \\"Even if we are giving weapons to the rebels, we live near to them. The Americans are on the other side of the ocean, why are they getting involved, delivering weapons to the Ukrainians?\\" Velgan said the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, should be held accountable for the civilian casualties that have been mounting in eastern Ukraine. \\"We need to kill Poroshenko, or tear him in two,\\" she said. \\"He's brought so much grief, and America is helping him.\\" Irina, a newspaper vendor, said: \\"I'm a patriot of my country, I can't say we shot it down.\\" She said the Ukrainian authorities were to blame for letting the plane fly over a war zone. Asked about the possibility of further US sanctions, she said: \\"What sanctions can there be when we don't know what is going on there?\\" Kovalyova added: \\"Sanctions on what? It's useless to dictate terms to Russia, it's too strong a country.\\" Opinions seemed strongly tied to the news sources people followed. Andrei, a pensioner who often listened to the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy, said of the coverage: \\"It feels like there's a lot of propaganda. \\"It was probably the separatists, that's my suspicion, but we will need an investigation.\\" Summary:","output":"Many Russians are placing the blame for the MH17 disaster on the Kiev government, rather than Ukrainian rebels. This comes as a result of various media outlets, including state-controlled channels, presenting a range of explanations for the tragedy, some debunked and others leaning towards conspiracy theories involving the US or Ukrainian forces. The diverse opinions amongst Russians appear to be tied to the news sources they follow, from conservative government channels to more liberal outlets."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The adaptive immune system, also known as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth. The acquired immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Acquired immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.

Lawrence's step-by-step approach in assisting William was as follows: Step 1: Assess the situation Before diving in, Lawrence took a moment to observe William's progress and identify areas where his assistance might be most helpful. He could see that William was struggling to assemble the tree's stand and keep the branches from tangling. Step 2: Offer help Lawrence approached William and kindly offered his help, making sure not to come across as intrusive or overbearing. He wanted to respect William's boundaries and only assist if William felt comfortable with it. Step 3: Assemble the Christmas tree stand Lawrence and William decided to tackle the stand first, as it serves as the base for the whole tree. Lawrence made sure to read the instructions carefully and ensured the stand was properly assembled, both safely and securely. Step 4: Fluff the tree's branches Once the stand was set up, Lawrence assisted William in detangling and fluffing the tree's branches. This task was important to give the tree a fuller and more natural appearance. Lawrence demonstrated how to gently separate the branches and adjust them at various angles to achieve a well-balanced look. Step 5: Secure the tree to the stand The next step involved placing the tree trunk into the stand and tightening the screws to keep it stable. Lawrence helped William hold the tree steady while William adjusted the screws, ensuring a snug fit before releasing their support. Step 6: Add lights to the Christmas tree Lawrence suggested they test the Christmas lights before putting them on the tree to ensure they were functional. Once confirmed, they worked together to wrap the lights around the tree, starting from the bottom and working their way up. Step 7: Decorate the tree After the lights were properly placed, Lawrence and William started hanging ornaments, tinsel, and other decorations on the tree. They made sure to spread them out evenly but also allowed for some personal creativity in the process. Step 8: Place the tree topper With the decorations in place, it was time to add the finishing touch - the tree topper. Lawrence provided some support to William as he reached up to place the star or angel on top, ensuring it was secure and straight. Step 9: Clean up Lastly, Lawrence and William cleaned up any mess created during the tree assembly, including disposing of any packaging and tidying up stray branches or fallen ornaments. The result was a beautiful, well-decorated Christmas tree that William proudly admired. Lawrence took this opportunity to remind William about the importance of teamwork, and that it's okay to ask for and accept help from others.

Humphrey Metrodome for a Week 15 Monday night NFC North rematch with the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, Chicago struck first as kicker Robbie Gould got a 29-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Vikings tied the game with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 42-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Bears would take the halftime lead as Gould kicked a 47-yard field goal and FB Jason McKie managed to get a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Minnesota started to creep closer as RB Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run (with a failed PAT) for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took the lead with Peterson getting an 8-yard TD run. Chicago tried to rally, but Minnesota's defense was too much. With their third-straight loss, not only did the Bears fall to 5-9, but they were knocked out of playoff contention. On a positive note, LB Brian Urlacher had a good day with 4 tackles, 2 sacks, and an interception. It was also the first time since 2004 that Urlacher had a sack and an interception in the same game. Answer this question based on the article: How many yards longer were Adrian Peterson's touchdowns compared to all other touchdowns combined?","output":"To answer this question, we must first dissect the information from the text. In the second quarter, Bears' FB Jason McKie managed to get a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, RB Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings scored a 1-yard TD run as well. And in the fourth quarter, he also scored an 8-yard TD run.  Here's how the calculation goes:  Adrian Peterson's touchdowns (1 yard + 8 yards) = 9 yards. Jason McKie's touchdown = 1 yard. Subtracting the yardage of McKie's touchdown from Peterson's total touchdown yardage will give us the difference.  So, 9 yards (Adrian Peterson's total) - 1 yard (Jason McKie's total) = 8 yards. Therefore, Adrian Peterson's touchdowns were 8 yards longer compared to all other touchdowns combined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Summary A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture of particles of one substance distributed throughout a second phase; the dispersed particles separate from the dispersing phase on standing. In contrast, the particles in a colloid are smaller and do not separate on standing. A colloid can be classified as a sol, a dispersion of solid particles in a liquid or solid; a gel, a semisolid sol in which all of the liquid phase has been absorbed by the solid particles; an aerosol, a dispersion of solid or liquid particles in a gas; or an emulsion, a dispersion of one liquid phase in another. A colloid can be distinguished from a true solution by its ability to scatter a beam of light, known as the Tyndall effect. Hydrophilic colloids contain an outer shell of groups that interact favorably with water, whereas hydrophobic colloids have an outer surface with little affinity for water. Emulsions are prepared by dispersing a hydrophobic liquid in water. In the absence of a dispersed hydrophobic liquid phase, solutions of detergents in water form organized spherical aggregates calledmicelles.

As Congress probes IRS targeting, the two parties offer varying takes on what happened. Congress, the IRS, the inspector general and the Justice Department are investigating. The GOP House Appropriations chairman evokes Nixon in warning of an enemies list. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: IRS Targeting Controversy Erupts as Legislators Clash Over Victims, Evoking Nixon-Era \\"Enemies List\\" The US House of Representatives hearing on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting scandal took a contentious turn as legislators clashed over the appearance of victims who had reportedly been subjected to enhanced scrutiny by the tax agency. As the congressional probe into the matter intensifies, the two major political parties have offered significantly differing takes on the unfolding events, with the Republican Party accusing the IRS of acting like an \\"enemies list\\" from the Nixon era. The investigation into the scandal revolves around allegations that the IRS has been systematically selecting conservative and progressive activist organizations for greater scrutiny during the tax-exempt application process, potentially targeting them for political reasons. The inquiry has been the subject of ongoing partisan contention, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers sparring over the implications of the findings and their potential impact on public trust in the tax-collection agency. It should be noted that the IRS targeting scandal has prompted multiple investigations, including those by Congress, the IRS itself, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the Department of Justice. Despite these parallel probes, however, the question of whether or not the agency's practices were politically motivated remains hotly debated, with both sides of the aisle eager to leverage the situation to their political advantage. During the House hearing, Republicans were highly critical of the IRS, accusing the agency of engaging in a pattern of politically motivated abuse reminiscent of the Nixon White House's infamous \\"enemies list.\\" This charge was made by the GOP House Appropriations Chairman, who, in a particularly heated moment of political theater, evoked the 37th President's legacy as a warning of what could happen when government institutions are used for political ends. Democrats, on the other hand, took a more measured approach to the issue, emphasizing the need for a thorough examination of the facts and challenging the narrative that the IRS was specifically targeting opponents of the sitting administration. They argued that conservative organizations were not being singled out for scrutiny, pointing out that liberal and progressive groups were also among those faced with additional IRS inquiries.  The presence of targeted victims at the hearing seemed to underscore the growing divide between the two parties' positions on the matter. The Republicans focused their attention on bringing attention to these victims and their stories, showcasing them as evidence of a larger pattern of political bias within the IRS. Meanwhile, Democrats questioned the decision to have these victims testify before the committee, raising concerns that it could set a dangerous precedent for future investigations. As the IRS scandal continues to gain momentum, the stakes are growing for both political parties. Republicans see this as an opportunity to further discredit the Obama administration and demand transparency and accountability, while Democrats hope to counter the allegations of political bias and demonstrate that the issue is more complex than a simple partisan attack. Ultimately, the outcome of the ongoing investigations will define the legacy of this scandal. If the IRS is found to have intentionally targeted specific political groups, the breach of trust between the government and American citizens will be difficult to repair. On the other hand, if the allegations of politically motivated targeting prove to be exaggerated or unfounded, the entire saga could be seen as an example of partisan politicking at its worst. In either case, the IRS targeting scandal is sure to have wide-reaching ramifications, as both Democrats and Republicans continue to offer their respective interpretations of the events in the hope of reshaping public opinion and defining the narrative for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Process:  - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated - The result is that crude oil forms.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sediment forms happens, how will it affect MORE oil.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more sediment forms on the sea floor, it could potentially affect the formation of crude oil.  If an increased amount of sediment forms above the decaying organic matter, it could cause higher pressure on the matter, leading to more effective compression. This might result in the formation of crude oil occurring at a faster rate than under normal conditions. This direct effect on the process could potentially lead to a greater quantity of crude oil being formed, as more organic matter is being compressed and turned into oil. However, there could also be indirect effects on the process. For example, an excessive accumulation of sediment may alter the environment in the sea, potentially affecting the distribution and diversity of living organisms. This, in turn, could change the amount of organic matter available for the formation of crude oil, influencing the overall efficiency of the process. The indirect effects are more complex and could either enhance or hinder the formation of crude oil, depending on the specific circumstances. In conclusion, the perturbation of increased sediment formation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of crude oil formation. While the direct effect might lead to more efficient oil formation, the indirect effects could be more unpredictable and depend on the specific environmental changes resulting from the increased sediment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the Chargers responded, with an 11-play, 80-yard drive, culminating in a 5-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to tight end Antonio Gates. The Broncos subsequently increased their lead to 19-10 with five minutes remaining in the game, with a 49-yard field goal by Barth.

Spiderland received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, including Spin, NME, and The Village Voice.

Their review noted the multiple listens it may take to appreciate it, acknowledging the album as \\"immediate as a snail trail to hell, 'Spiderland' needs several plays to burn its way into your consciousness, but when it does...\\"In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that Spiderland is \\"one of the most important indie albums of the '90s\\" and a \\"singular achievement\\" which found the band \\"working with dynamics that made the silences every bit as much presence as the guitars and drums, manipulating space and time as they stretched out and juggled time signatures, and conjuring melodies that were as sparse and fragmented as they were beautiful\\". Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and wrote that, despite their \\"sad-sack affect\\", Slint are actually \\"art-rockers without the courage of their pretensions\\" with poor lyrics.

Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds. The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \\"dances\\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: How might plumage help a bird defend themselves? A:","output":"Plumage can help a bird defend themselves by making threatening displays, such as in the case of the sunbittern, which mimics a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. This use of plumage serves as a visual communication to deter potential threats and safeguard the bird and its offspring."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who Geoffery Bush characterizes as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\"? , can you please find it?   Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The Thames has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from Keltic fire and agony, as the Thames is from the Spey. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of Wordsworth rather than of Byron and Shelley. W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: His sense of form was so strong, and his refined nature so abhorred any mere seeking after effect, that his music sometimes gives the impression of being produced under restraint. He seldom, if ever, gave rein to his unbridled fancy; everything is justly proportioned, clearly defined, and kept within the limits which the conscientiousness of his self-criticism would not let him overstep. It is this which makes him, as has been said, so peculiarly a musician's composer: the broad effects and bold contrasts which an uneducated public admires are absent; it takes an educated audience to appreciate to the full the exquisitely refined and delicate nature of his genius. Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. Geoffrey Bush agrees that \\"[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)\\", and characterizes him as \\"essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin\\".

Q:The answer to the question: What were the names of the five models Saint-Saëns forged his own style from? is inside the article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less..., can you guess it ?

Smaller island ranges are found throughout the state. In total, 77 named ranges are part of the Rocky Mountains.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The nation state containing the \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" is the United States of America. The term \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" refers to the state of Montana, which is located in the western region of the United States. Montana is known for its majestic mountain ranges, particularly those found in the western third of the state, which are part of the Rocky Mountains. The state's name itself, Montana, is derived from the Spanish word \\"montaña,\\" meaning mountain.  Montana has several unofficial nicknames, including \\"Big Sky Country\\" and \\"The Treasure State.\\" These nicknames reflect the state's expansive skies, natural resources, and overall beauty. The state is also known for its sparse population, ranking 44th in population and 48th in population density out of the 50 United States. This fact has given rise to its more recent slogan, \\"The Last Best Place,\\" highlighting the state's unspoiled, natural, and beautiful landscapes. Being a part of the United States, Montana shares the nation's rich history, diverse culture, and affinity for freedom and individualism. The state is known for its strong Native American heritage, with several tribes calling Montana home, including the Blackfeet, Crow, Cheyenne, and Northern Cheyenne, among others. Montana's stunning natural sites, such as Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and the Flathead Lake, are not only important to the region's ecosystem but also provide numerous recreational opportunities for residents and visitors alike. In conclusion, the \\"Land of the Shining Mountains\\" can be found within the nation state of the United States of America, specifically referring to the state of Montana. Known for its incredible mountain ranges, extensive natural beauty, and unique societal values, Montana truly lives up to its nickname as a land where mountains shine in both their physical presence and their impact on the state's identity and culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All six riders were taken to the hospital after being struck by a car driven by a British woman. The incident has raised concerns regarding the safety of cyclists on the road and the importance of promoting awareness and adherence to traffic laws by both drivers and cyclists alike. Background and Details: On a sunny day in southern Spain, a team of Giant-Alpecin cyclists set out for a routine training session, hoping to fine-tune their skills and build their endurance as they prepared for upcoming races. However, the ride was anything but ordinary as the six professional cyclists encountered an unthinkable situation. At approximately 3:30 pm, the team of riders were traveling in a single file formation when a car, driven by a British woman, came towards them head-on, leaving the cyclists with little time to react. Despite swerving in an attempt to avoid the collision, the cyclists were struck, resulting in severe injuries that required immediate medical attention.  Emergency Response and Hospitalization: Witnesses to the incident quickly called emergency services, and rescuers arrived promptly on the scene to provide aid and evacuate the injured cyclists. All six riders were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment of their injuries, which ranged from fractures and cuts to more life-threatening damages. Although specific details regarding the riders' injuries have not yet been disclosed, it has been confirmed that none of the cyclists involved have suffered life-threatening injuries. Investigation and Potential Consequences: Local authorities have launched an investigation into the incident to determine the cause of the collision, assess liability, and decide on potential legal consequences for the parties involved. So far, it has been established that the British driver had unintentionally drifted into the lane of the approaching cyclists, leading to the catastrophic event. As the investigation continues and more details emerge, the cycling community, along with road safety advocates, are calling for stricter measures to protect vulnerable road users such as cyclists. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to road safety regulations and the potential consequences when these rules are not followed. Conclusion: The Giant-Alpecin cycling team and their loved ones now face a period of uncertainty and recovery as the hospitalized riders undergo various treatments and rehabilitation programs. This regrettable incident underscores the need for drivers to exercise caution and vigilance when sharing the road with cyclists. Road safety authorities, government officials, and cycling organizations must continue to work together to establish a safer environment for all road users and prevent such tragic accidents from happening in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Roundworms contribute to soils, and ask you the question \\"what contributes to soils?\\", is the correct answer \\"roundworms\\"? Select from the following. [a]. Yes. [b]. No. Answer:","output":"a. Yes. Roundworms, also known as nematodes, are one of the many organisms that contribute to the overall health and fertility of soils. They play an essential role in the soil ecosystem, and their presence helps to maintain the balance of nutrients, decompose organic matter, and support other organisms living in the soil. Soil is a complex and dynamic natural environment, comprising various physical, chemical, and biological elements. Numerous factors contribute to soil composition, including organic matter, geological material, water, air, and a diverse range of organisms. In addition to roundworms, there are many other organisms that play a vital role in maintaining soil health, such as earthworms, arthropods, bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoa. These organisms collectively form the soil food web, which is a complex, interconnected network of relationships that together contribute to the overall functioning of the soil ecosystem.  Roundworms, specifically, are an essential part of the soil food web, as they are responsible for decomposing organic matter and, in turn, releasing essential nutrients back into the soil. They inhabit a wide range of ecological niches, feeding on different sources of organic matter, such as plant debris, fungi, bacteria, and even other nematodes. As they consume and decompose organic matter, they release vital nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, thereby recycling these nutrients and making them available to other organisms, including plants. Furthermore, roundworms play a significant role in the regulation of soil microbial communities. Their predation on bacteria and fungi can help keep these populations in check, which ultimately maintains a balance in the soil ecosystem. Roundworms' feeding activity also helps with the distribution of nutrients within the soil matrix, as they burrow through soil layers and mix nutrients with their movement. In conclusion, the correct answer for the question \\"What contributes to soils?\\" with the given information is \\"roundworms\\" since they contribute to the health and fertility of soils by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and regulating soil microbial populations. However, it is important to acknowledge that they are just one of many organisms and factors that collectively contribute to the complex and dynamic nature of soils."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Options: A higher than 34.4degC B lower than 29.4degC C between 40.6-41.7degC D between 34.4-37degC Answer: B lower than 29.4degC Question: Answer:","output":"Question: At what core body temperature range does the human body's natural temperature regulating system usually fail, causing a rapid decline in core body temperature and potentially resulting in death?

First, look at the numbers on the right side. We see -78 and 126. We need to add these two numbers together. Remember, when you add a negative number, it's like taking away. So, it's like having 126 and taking away 78.     126 - 78 = 48  So now our equation looks like this: -12*y = 48 2. Now, we want to get 'y' all by itself. Right now, we have -12 multiplied by 'y'. To do that, we'll do the opposite of multiplication, which is division. So, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -12.    -12*y / -12 = 48 / -12 3. Divide the numbers:    -12 / -12 = 1 (y)     48 / -12 = -4 Now our equation looks like this: y = -4 And that's it! The solution to the math problem is y = -4.

Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible.

Winter weather is notorious for causing dangerous driving conditions due to various factors like fog, melting snow, and ice, as mentioned in the text. Driving in such conditions requires increased caution and adherence to certain rules. The first rule is to drive smoothly, meaning that any movements to start, stop, increase, or decrease the speed of the car should be executed gently and slowly. This reduces the risk of losing control of the car on slippery surfaces. The second rule is to pay attention and anticipate potential hazards. In icy conditions, drivers should increase their following distance and look further down the road to spot potential risks in advance. When it comes to stopping distances, they vary depending on the condition of the road. The text suggests that drivers should generally allow twice their usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times on snow, and even more on ice. This contradicts the statement in option C, which is therefore not true. In conclusion, winter driving conditions increase the risk of traffic accidents, and drivers are advised to exercise greater caution when on the road.

This information contradicts the first sentence, as it implies that the person who rescued the orphan girls belongs to a least important family rather than an important family. As a result, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence due to the difference in the family's importance.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Phyllis and Meredith have the exact same diet and are both going to see a dietician for suggestions about what they should eat. Phyllis is currently five months pregnant and wants to see if she should do anything differently in regards to her food consumption. Meredith is not pregnant, but still wants to go to see if her diet is acceptable.  But I can use this background: Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron—27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table below ). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb.  What is an answer for this question: Which woman's diet will most likely include more red meat? A:","output":"Phyllis' diet will most likely include more red meat. As she is pregnant, her need for iron is significantly higher (27 mg daily) compared to Meredith who is not pregnant. Red meat is a good source of iron, so it is likely that her dietician will suggest incorporating more of it into her diet to help meet her increased iron needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Healthy leaves will look large, green, have no ridges, and will be much bigger than the seedling leaves. Jackfruit seedlings can be sensitive and do not like to be disturbed. Make sure the seedling looks strong enough before considering transplanting it. Find an area at least 30 feet (9.1m) away from other trees to place the jackfruit plant. Since Jackfruit trees can grow up to 100 feet (30m) tall if left alone, the tree will need a big open space that receives full sun.  Avoid planting the tree near your house since the roots will grow out and could cause damage. Find an area that is sheltered from strong wind so that your tree can develop safely. Once you have chosen your spot for the jackfruit tree, clear any surrounding weeds and debris. Be sure to remove any  tree stumps and old roots to avoid potential root disease in your jackfruit plant. If necessary, you may need to plough the soil first to ensure it is soft and fertile. Use a shovel to dig a hole 2 x 2 x 2 feet (0.61 x 0.61 x 0.61 meters) deep for your tree. This hole can be square or circular.  To check if the soil is well-draining, check to see whether it has any sand or clay. If it does not, you can make your soil drain better by mixing in sand or compost. To give your jackfruit a boost start with natural nutrients, add compost to the soil. Place one hand around the base of the jackfruit plant, on top of the potted soil. With your other hand, tip the pot over so that the plant and soil slide out together. You may need to twist the plant gently or tap the pot to loosen the soil from the edges.  Try not to pull the plant out, as it may rip out part of its root system. If the roots have wrapped around the dirt to match the shape of the pot, use your fingers to gently tease the roots so that they are facing outwards. This will help them grow down into the surrounding soil. You don’t want to bury the jackfruit itself, so if your hole is too deep, scoop a few handfuls of dirt in to give it a base. Then carefully pat in loose dirt around the roots until the hole is filled. Form a mound around the base of the plant so that the water can run off into the soil.  Pat the soil so that it is solid, but be careful not to pack the soil in too tightly. Water the plant immediately. Thoroughly water the jackfruit plant to help it recover and get established in its new surroundings. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the provided article would be as follows: To successfully transplant a jackfruit seedling, ensure it is healthy and strong before choosing a well-drained, sunny location at least 30 feet away from other trees and structures. Clear the area, remove any tree stumps, and prepare the soil by ploughing, if necessary. Dig a 2x2x2 feet hole and mix compost into the soil for added nutrients. Carefully remove the seedling from its pot without damaging the root system and tease the roots to encourage downward growth. Place the seedling in the hole, backfill with soil, form a mound around it, and water thoroughly to help it establish in its new environment."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Thulasi is a 1987 Tamil romantic drama film directed by Ameerjaan.

An elderly woman trapped in her burning home.      All of them rescued by individuals who risked their own lives to help.      The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission awarded medals for valor to 18 people on Wednesday, including four who perished in their rescue attempts.      Among the honorees is Joshua W. Steed, 20, a college student in Abilene, Texas, who was in the office of an apartment complex on Sept. 7, 2011, when his 21-year-old co-worker, working the front desk, was shot in the head by an assailant with a .38-caliber revolver.      Instead of closing the office door to protect himself, Steed rushed the gunman and threw a chair at him, according to the commission. Then he grabbed the gunman by the arms, rammed him into a wall and threw him to the floor _ getting his gun in the process.      Steed's co-worker survived.      Ione Fletcher Kleven similarly ran toward trouble when she heard a 14-year-old boy screaming for help in her Castro Valley, California, neighborhood in 2010.      The 64-year-old portrait artist chased off three men who'd attacked the boy, punching and kicking him and stabbing him twice in the back and once in the stomach. The boy recovered.      Other medal winners are from Illinois, Hawaii, New Jersey, Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas, South Carolina, Florida, Massachusetts and Calgary, Canada. Collectively they saved seven people from drowning, two from burning cars, and one from a burning home. And a police officer in New Brunswick, New Jersey, climbed over the fence of a railroad trestle to rescue a suicidal woman dangling 25 feet (7.5 meters) above a street.      Carnegie medalists or their heirs receive financial grants approved by the commission. More than 34.8 million has been awarded to 9,576 honorees since the fund's inception in 1904.      Steel baron Andrew Carnegie was inspired to start the fund after hearing rescue stories from a mine disaster that killed 181 people.

What is the smallest particle of the element gold (Au) that can still be classified as gold?","output":"To determine the smallest particle of the element gold (Au) that can still be classified as gold, we need to identify the smallest unit that retains the chemical properties of the gold element. 1. Identify the basic unit of an element - Atoms are the basic units of an element. All elements are composed of atoms. 2. Know the structure of an atom - Atoms consist of a nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. 3. Recognize the role of atomic number - An element's atomic number defines the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. The atomic number of gold (Au) is 79, meaning a gold atom has 79 protons. 4. Understand isotopes - Isotopes are different forms of an element with the same atomic number but different numbers of neutrons. Gold has only one stable isotope, which is gold-197 (197Au). This means that a gold (Au) nucleus has 79 protons and 118 neutrons. Conclusion: The smallest particle of the element gold (Au) that can still be classified as gold is a single gold atom with 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus, making it gold-197 (197Au). This atom retains the chemical properties that characterize gold as an element."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have never had a lot of money. But I don’t believe you have to have a lot for it to become burdensome. Money has always seemed to be a burden. Either you have it and the obligation and responsibility becomes a burden (so I’ve been told, ha) or you don’t have it and life without money becomes a burden. I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills. Let me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas. I was able to pay my bills and juggle things around to afford what the girls needed for school and what not. When I didn’t have money for something they wanted I felt like I carried the world on my shoulders. I didn’t let them know how stressful it all was because I felt like it was none of their business. They were kids and needed to be kids. They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn’t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids. Once, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her 5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around. She said “No, Mom, you can be dead-assed broke and the world is still going to go around.” That was when I quit letting money be a burden. Question: What school did her daughters attend?

British powerboat racer killed in 120mph crash William Nocker, 47, suffered fatal injuries after losing control of the powerful boat in the Gabon Grand Prix in West Africa. He was rushed to a military hospital in Gabon’s capital city Libreville but doctors were unable to resuscitate him. His co-driver, Norwegian Kurt Olsen, was badly hurt in the smash and remains in a critical condition in intensive care. No other drivers were involved in the crash on Friday, which appeared to happen after Mr Nocker’s boat hit two waves, witnesses said. Race promoters H20 Racing said contact had been made with Mr Nocker’s father Bill and brother James following the accident. Mr Nocker, who lived in Cheltenham, was returning to the sport following a five-year suspension after he was found guilty of tampering with a competitor’s fuel supply. Wreckage ... the smashed boat is recovered after it flipped at 120mph A tribunal upheld charges of gross misconduct and unsportsmanlike behaviour against Mr Nocker and fellow racer Rob Lister after it was alleged water was poured into the tank of a rival boat during the Liverpool Powerboat Grand Prix in 2006. Mr Nocker, who was originally from Tiverton, in Devon, was racing for the Welmax Offshore Racing team at the event in Gabon. The race, the second round of the Class 1 world offshore championship, was immediately stopped following the accident as safety teams rushed to attend to the injured crew at the scene. As a mark of respect organisers cancelled the next day’s second round before abandoning the event completely. The sport’s governing body, Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM), has launched an investigation into the cause of the crash and plans to inspect the boat’s wreckage. Gabon’s prime minister Ndong Sima joined racing teams as they returned to the crash site today to pay tribute to Mr Nocker. They held a minute’s silence and laid a wreath on the water while competitors and team members scattered flowers. Nicolo di San Germano, president of H20 Racing, said: “We are all extremely saddened by this tragic racing accident.

Again, the search was concentrated in northeastern Pennsylvania, and Trooper Tom Kelly acknowledges that Selenski could be out of the area. The main difference here is that the exact distance Selenski might have traveled is not specified, but the essence of the statement remains the same - he could be outside the initially searched area. In summary, both sentences imply that the search was initially focused on a specific region in Pennsylvania, but by now, Selenski may have moved beyond the boundaries of that area.

Review: its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as leaning more towards a negative perspective due to the critical observation it makes about the movie's portrayal of work. The reviewer highlights that the movie seems to emphasize the illusion of work as being more grueling and time-consuming than actual work. This suggests that the movie may not be accurately representing the reality of work, or that it exaggerates or focuses too much on the less productive aspects of work for the sake of creating an illusion.  The choice of words like \\"grueling\\" and \\"time-consuming\\" further supports the negative connotation, as these terms usually describe undesirable or exhausting experiences. If the reviewer were positively impressed by this aspect of the movie, they might use terms like \\"intriguing\\" or \\"compelling\\" instead.

However, it does not mention anything about flowers being inside the pots or their location. Statement 2: \\"The flowers are in the nursery.\\" This statement only provides information about the location of the flowers, which are in a nursery.

The premise clearly expresses that the speaker is uncomfortable or unhappy with being addressed in a certain way. It indicates a desire to not be called by the specific name or term that was used previously. As a result, disregarding this request and assuming that it is okay to use that name or term would be in direct contradiction to the speaker's wishes. It is essential to respect others' preferences and boundaries when interacting, especially when it comes to addressing them. Names and terms carry certain connotations, and it may be possible that addressing someone in a certain way could evoke negative emotions, memories, or associations. For example, a nickname given to them that reminds them of a painful past, derogatory terms, or an incorrect name that doesn't identify their true self. Understanding the importance of addressing people according to their preferences helps maintain healthy and respectful relationships. By acknowledging the premise, \\"'Don't call me that,\\" and choosing not to refer to the person as they have requested, you show your empathy and consideration for their feelings. In doing so, you foster a positive environment and build trust in the relationship.

Detailed Instructions: In this task the focus is on physical knowledge about the world. Given the provided goal task in the input, describe a process that would lead to the asked outcome. This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc.  Q: How often should I water my plants in the outdoor garden? A:","output":"To determine how often you should water your plants in the outdoor garden, please consider the following steps: Step 1: Assess the plant types Different plants have varying water requirements. Familiarize yourself with the water needs of each plant in your garden and group them accordingly (if possible) to make watering more efficient. Step 2: Check the soil Feel the soil around your plants to determine its moisture level. If the soil feels dry and crumbly, it's time to water. If it feels moist, you can wait to water. Typically, it is advisable to water your outdoor plants deeply once or twice a week, depending on the climate, plant type, and soil type. Step 3: Account for regional climate and seasonal changes Watering frequency can change with the seasons, as hot summer months may require more frequent watering whereas cooler or rainy months may require less. Keep an eye on the weather forecast and adjust your watering schedule accordingly. Step 4: Observe your plants Look out for signs of over- or under-watering in your plants. Wilting, yellowing leaves, or stunted growth can all indicate water-related issues. Use these observations to tweak your watering schedule as needed. Step 5: Water at the right time Water your plants early in the morning or in the evening to minimize water evaporation during the day. Watering at these times also reduces the likelihood of plant diseases caused by standing water on the leaves. In summary, determining how often to water your outdoor garden plants involves understanding the types of plants, assessing soil moisture, considering regional climate and seasonal changes, observing plant health, and choosing the right time to water. As a general rule, deep watering once or twice a week is a good starting point, but adjustments may be necessary based on your specific plants and environmental factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Knowing that \\"An example of camouflage is when something changes color in order to have the same color as its environment\\", how would one answer \\"Where would an arctic hare be least likely to be seen by a predator?\\"","output":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question. The question is asking in which environment an arctic hare would be least visible to a predator due to its camouflage ability. Step 2: Gather information about Arctic Hares. Arctic Hares have a white fur coat in the winter to blend in with the snowy environment, and a brownish-grey coat in the summer to match the tundra vegetation. Step 3: Identify the environments with the best camouflage for Arctic Hares. Based on their coat color changes, Arctic Hares are best camouflaged in snow during winter and in tundra vegetation during summer. Step 4: Determine the least likely place for Arctic Hares to be seen by predators. Considering their camouflage abilities, Arctic Hares would be least likely to be seen by predators in an environment that matches their current fur color; in a snowy environment during winter and in tundra vegetation during summer. Step 5: Provide the justified answer. An Arctic Hare would be least likely to be seen by a predator in a snowy environment during winter when its fur coat is white, and in tundra vegetation during summer when its fur coat is brownish-grey. This is because its coat color effectively camouflages it within the respective environment, making it difficult for predators to spot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I bought these headphones loving the idea that i would have a retractable cord. But, much to my dismay, the retraction system broke fairly quickly. I sent them back, got a new pair, and same thing happened again. I didn't feel like going through the process of return over and over and over again, so i just said screw it and bought other headphones. If only these guys were reliable, they'd be perfect... Answer: Answer:","output":"The product review provided is not positive. From both the review title \\"DO NOT BUY THEY BREAK EVERYTIME!\\" and the review body, it is apparent that the customer had a negative experience with the product. The reviewer loves the concept of headphones with a retractable cord, expressing their immediate and initial approval for the product due to its design and functionality. This appreciation, however, was not sustained due to a problem they encountered – the failure of the retractable system. This functional issue was not an isolated incident. The reviewer explains that they returned the flawed product and were sent a replacement pair of headphones, which also turned out to have the same problem. The repeat failure of the product to deliver its core feature, notably on two separate occasions, has substantially contributed to the negative outlook expressed by the reviewer. The customer’s frustration is further heightened by the tedious return process, perhaps suggesting that the customer service experience did not meet their expectations either. This dissatisfaction ultimately led them to stop trying to have the product replaced, resulting in the reviewer abandoning this item altogether and resorting to purchasing different headphones. The concluding sentence of the review encapsulates the reviewer's disappointment whilst also revealing a kind of regret. Where the product could have been 'perfect' by meeting the reviewer's needs and expectations, the unreliability of the device has disallowed this possibility. In conclusion, although the title and review might be succinct, they poignantly denote the customer's journey from initial enthusiasm and approval to ultimate disappointment and frustration. It's clear that the customer's experience with this product and the ensuing customer service encounters were negative, affirming that this is indeed a negative product review."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

The word \\"seat\\" alone does not carry any emotional aspect as it is simply a noun referring to a place to sit, such as a chair or a bench. To determine the sentiment of a sentence or phrase, we need to consider the context and the adjectives or verbs associated with the given noun. For instance, looking at these two examples: 1. \\"I found a comfortable seat in the movie theater.\\" 2. \\"The seat I found in the crowded train was very uncomfortable.\\" In the first example, the sentiment would be positive because of the adjective \\"comfortable,\\" while in the second one, it would be negative due to the adjective \\"uncomfortable.\\" However, when analyzing the word \\"seat\\" alone without any context or modifying words, it is not possible to classify it as either positive or negative.

Article:Last week, legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour, considered one of fashion's most influential voices, was overheard on a train lambasting the mogul. Her comments came as Teen Vogue ran a \\"scorched-earth\\" attack on Mr Trump, posting an opinion editorial that accused him of repeatedly lying to the public. Many online readers were shocked by the ferocity of the piece - and Miss Wintour's criticisms. But what both show is that 2016 has changed women's magazines, perhaps forever. Vogue and others are now unashamedly political, securing access to top-ranking leaders and endorsing their favourites in print. Vogue set out its stall for then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in mid-October, by endorsing her for the presidency. \\"Vogue has no history of political endorsements,\\" the fashion Bible noted, before stating that it was making an exception \\"given the profound stakes of this one\\". Critics said the glossy had no business weighing in on politics, but many readers praised it for considering readers' core concerns. Vogue pointed out that while it has profiled Ms Clinton six times, it has also featured Ivana, Marla, Melania, and Ivanka Trump repeatedly in its pages. And it wasn't alone in making a historic exception. \\"For me, the only option is Hillary Clinton,\\" Glamour magazine editor-in-chief Cindi Leive wrote the same month, in a piece titled \\"In This Election, I'm With Her\\". Ms Leive noted that after four election cycles spent at Glamour, 2016 was the first time she had felt compelled to share her private views. Surprise! Teenage girls care about politics Vogue uses 'real women' in special issue Nine down-to-earth discoveries I made at Vogue magazine \\"One of the two major candidates [Hillary Clinton] is an experienced public servant, while the other [Donald Trump] sports a decades-long résumé of dismissiveness toward women and their concerns,\\" she wrote. The same passion for politics crossed the border to Marie Claire Mexico, which put Ivanka Trump on its cover along with a public plea: \\"#DearIvanka. When will you protect us from your father?\\" One reason the recent Teen Vogue opinion piece spread like wildfire online is that non-readers associate the brand with boyfriend angst and make-up tips. Few people expected it to publish something so hard-hitting. But maybe they should have. \\"Young women have been excited and perhaps disturbed by things like Brexit and Donald Trump,\\" says Barbara Rowlands, an associate professor in the journalism department at City, University of London. \\"If there was a junior GQ and they put something like that up, nobody would have batted an eyelid.\\" Dr Rowlands says younger Teen Vogue readers generally come from an ABC1 readership, and will have heard discussions about Donald Trump - so naturally they are curious. Feminist commentators have suggested the shock at Teen Vogue publishing a coherent piece of political opinion is a sign of how badly women are under-estimated. \\"Stop proudly flaunting your low expectations,\\" advised US feminist writer Roxane Gay on Twitter. In September 2016, Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka cut short an interview with Cosmopolitan.com after being asked how her father's childcare policy compared to his past remarks on maternity leave. Interviewer Prachi Gupta said: \\"In 2004, Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business. It's surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?\\" According to Cosmo's transcript, the mother of three replied: \\"I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions. So I don't know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this.\\" She terminated the meeting shortly afterwards. Ms Gupta's other political reporting has included a video piece where five young women explained why they were voting for Mr Trump. Lena Dunham, creator of the HBO TV show Girls, interviewed Ms Clinton for her feminist email newsletter, Lenny. The interview was full of personal insights from a candidate frequently accused of lacking warmth, including how she felt about working in a salmon canning factory after college. Miss Dunham, who was a vocal Democrat supporter in the run-up to the US presidential vote, asked Ms Clinton if she had worried about marrying her husband Bill. \\"I was terrified about losing my identity and getting lost in the wake of Bill's force-of-nature personality,\\" the former secretary of state admitted. \\"I actually turned him down twice when he asked me to marry him.\\" In August 2016, President Barack Obama penned an exclusive piece for Glamour magazine about his feminist views as a man and a father. It was a gesture that showed he was keen to address young women through whatever media they are drawn to. \\"Michelle and I have raised our daughters to speak up when they see a double standard or feel unfairly judged based on their gender or race - or when they notice that happening to someone else,\\" he wrote. \\"It's important for them to see role models out in the world who climb to the highest levels of whatever field they choose. And yes, it's important that their dad is a feminist, because now that's what they expect of all men.\\" Glamour says it has 10 million print readers and 15 million unique users online. With that in mind, it seems less surprising that politicians are harnessing it to get their message across. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"In 2016, women's magazines such as Vogue, Glamour, and Marie Claire became unashamedly political, endorsing presidential nominees and featuring interviews with high-profile politicians. Vogue endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, despite having no history of political endorsements, while Glamour's editor-in-chief Cindi Leive shared her private views in support of Clinton. Marie Claire Mexico featured Ivanka Trump on its cover along with a plea to protect them from her father, Donald Trump. This shift toward political content demonstrates that women's magazines are evolving to engage with the interests of their readers beyond fashion and lifestyle topics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

However, new information is emerging, shedding light on the aircraft's possible whereabouts, with experts analyzing a failed satellite phone call made after the plane dropped off radar. Satellite Call Made After Radar Disappearance: According to an official, airline staff attempted to call the missing plane via satellite phone after it disappeared from radar. The call proved unsuccessful, but it has provided experts with a valuable lead. A thorough analysis of this call has helped pinpoint a more accurate location of MH370 in the Indian Ocean. No Change in Search Zone, Yet Areas of Interest Identified: Although the overall Indian Ocean search zone for MH370 remains the same, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia has mentioned particular areas of interest slightly to the south. Australian authorities have been heavily involved in the search efforts for the missing aircraft and believe this new information could prove vital in their ongoing investigations. Conclusion: The unveiling of these new findings offers a glimmer of hope to the families and friends of those on board MH370, as efforts continue to locate the aircraft. Although there is no guarantee that these areas of interest will produce conclusive results, this new development serves as a reminder that the search for MH370 persists, and authorities continue to work tirelessly in their pursuit of answers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  Answer this question please: In which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, stage A or stage B?","output":"Based on the background information provided, gas molecules collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder when the temperature is increased. In the given scenario, stage A represents the gas at room temperature (300 K) and stage B represents the gas after being heated up.

As an educator, their primary focus should be on ensuring that their students understand the material being taught, and they should be open to addressing any confusion or misunderstandings that may arise. When Riley petitions her professor for a redress, she demonstrates a belief that her answer may have been evaluated unfairly or inaccurately. It is important for the professor to review the specifics of her answer and to provide a clear explanation as to why it was marked as incorrect. This response serves a dual purpose: it helps to clarify the correct response for Riley, and it promotes a sense of fairness and transparency in the grading process. In this context, it is highly inappropriate for the professor to punish Riley or ask her for money to change the answer. Punishing Riley for challenging the accuracy of her grade would discourage open communication between students and professors and create a negative learning environment. Similarly, soliciting money in exchange for altering a student's grade represents a violation of academic integrity and ethical responsibility, and it would undermine both the professor's credibility and the trust that students place in their educational institution. In conclusion, the most appropriate action for the professor in this situation is to explain why Riley got the question wrong, ensuring that they address her concerns and provide necessary clarification. This approach upholds the values of fairness and education, and it helps to foster an environment in which students feel comfortable seeking help and asking questions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And the answer is...","output":"Alright, let's solve the problem step-by-step: We have the equation -4 * g = -8 + 12. First, we need to add -8 and 12 together. Imagine you have -8 apples and someone gives you 12 more apples. Now, how many apples do you have?  (-8) + 12 = 4 So, our equation becomes -4 * g = 4. Now we need to find what number g is. To do that, we have to get rid of the -4 that's beside g. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by -4. (-4 * g) / (-4) = 4 / (-4) When we divide, we get: g = -1 And there's our answer! The value of g is -1, like having one apple taken away from you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What are the only arteries in the adult human body to carry deoxygenated blood? What is the answer?","output":"The only arteries in the adult human body that carry deoxygenated blood are the pulmonary arteries. In most cases, arteries transport oxygenated blood away from the heart to various tissues and organs throughout the body. However, the pulmonary arteries are an exception to this general rule. The pulmonary arteries are responsible for transporting deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation, a process that occurs through the pulmonary circulation. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air in the alveoli of the lungs ('gas exchange') is essential for maintaining life. Here's a detailed overview of the process: 1. Deoxygenated blood, which contains high levels of carbon dioxide as a waste product from cellular respiration, collects in the right atrium of the heart. This blood comes from the upper half of the body through the superior vena cava and the lower half through the inferior vena cava. 2. The right atrium contracts and pumps the deoxygenated blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. 3. The right ventricle contracts and pumps the blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary trunk, which bifurcates into the right and left pulmonary arteries. 4. The right pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood to the right lung, and the left pulmonary artery carries it to the left lung. These arteries further subdivide into smaller branches as they reach the lung tissue until they become capillaries surrounding the alveoli. 5. In the alveoli, the gas exchange takes place. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the alveolar walls and into the capillaries, binding to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide in the blood diffuses into the alveoli to be exhaled from the body. 6. Oxygenated blood from the capillaries converges into venules and then into the four pulmonary veins (two from each lung). 7. The pulmonary veins transport the oxygenated blood back to the heart, specifically to the left atrium. The blood then flows through the bicuspid (mitral) valve into the left ventricle, which pumps it through the aortic valve and into the aorta for systemic circulation. In conclusion, the pulmonary arteries are the only arteries in the adult human body to carry deoxygenated blood. These arteries play a crucial role in delivering deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it is oxygenated and then returned to the heart for distribution throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright?

Read this article and answer this question In 1916 Romania entered World War I on the side of the Allies. In doing so, Romania's goal was to unite all the territories with a Romanian national majority into one state. In the Treaty of Bucharest , terms for Romania's acquisition of territories within Austria-Hungary were stipulated. In 1918, after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks signed a separate peace with the Central Powers in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Romania was alone on the Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities. Therefore, on 7 May 1918, Romania sued for peace. The prime minister of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, signed the Treaty of Bucharest  with the Central Powers. However, this treaty was never signed by King Ferdinand of Romania. At the end of 1918 Romania's situation was dire. She was suffering from the consequences of punitive war reparations. Dobruja was under Bulgarian occupation. The German army under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen was retreating through Romania. The bulk of the Romanian army was demobilized, leaving only four full-strength divisions. A further eight divisions were left in a reserve status. The four battle-ready divisions were used to keep order and protect Basarabia from possible hostile actions of the Soviet Union. On 10 November 1918, taking advantage of the Central Powers' precarious situation, Romania re-entered the war on the side of the Allied forces, with similar objectives to those of 1916. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian army and ordered it to attack by crossing the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that soon followed did not bring an end to  fighting for the Romanian army. Its action continued into 1918 and 1919 in the Hungarian-Romanian war.

The question aims to test the responder's knowledge of geography, cultural landmarks, and perhaps a bit of history. To provide a detailed answer, let's delve into each of these castles: 1. Cawdor Castle: Cawdor Castle is a 14th-century fortress situated in the civil parish of Cawdor in the Scottish Highlands. The castle was initially built by Clan Calder, and later on, it became the property of Campbells. It is known for its connection to William Shakespeare's famous play \\"Macbeth,\\" where Cawdor Castle was mentioned as the residence of Thane of Cawdor; however, the historical events and timeline do not match the fictional story. 2. Glamis Castle: Glamis Castle is an impressive architectural masterpiece located in the village of Glamis, Angus, Scotland. It is the historic seat of the Lyon family, Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and is still inhabited by the current countess. The castle was built in the late 14th century and has a rich history, which includes its connection to Queen Elizabeth II's mother, who was born there. Glamis Castle is also famous for various legends and ghost stories, including the legend of the Monster of Glamis and the tale of the White Lady. 3. Blair Castle: Blair Castle is situated in the beautiful region of Perthshire, Scotland, near the village of Blair Atholl. It is the ancestral home of the Clan Murray. Construction of the castle began in the late 13th century, and it has undergone multiple renovations and expansion through the centuries. Blair Castle played an important role in the Jacobite Rebellions and has continued to be a significant landmark in Scottish history. Considering the descriptions and locations of Cawdor Castle, Glamis Castle, and Blair Castle, the question is asking about Scotland, as all three of these historical and architecturally significant castles are located within the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Injecting adversarial examples during training, known as adversarial training, can improve robustness against one-step attacks, but not for unknown iterative attacks. To address this challenge, we first show iteratively generated adversarial images easily transfer between networks trained with the same strategy. Inspired by this observation, we propose cascade adversarial training, which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training. We train a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks in addition to one-step adversarial images from the network being trained. We also propose to utilize embedding space for both classification and low-level (pixel-level) similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel level perturbation. During training, we inject adversarial images without replacing their corresponding clean images and penalize the distance between the two embeddings (clean and adversarial). Experimental results show that cascade adversarial training together with our proposed low-level similarity learning efficiently enhances the robustness against iterative attacks, but at the expense of decreased robustness against one-step attacks. We show that combining those two techniques can also improve robustness under the worst case black box attack scenario.","output":"Cascade adversarial training improves network robustness against iterative attacks by transferring knowledge from defended networks and utilizing embedding space for classification and low-level similarity learning.

He is assisted by ASP Prasad (Ganeshan), one of the sincere officers who admires Joseph for his arrogant way of dealing politicians and officials. Also tagging along with Alex is the young assistant district collector Anuradha Mukerji IAS (Vani Viswanath), whose freecare style conflicts against Alex's strict behavior because of her tragic childhood. It later turns out that Anura's behavior was rooted from a horrible experience of when her father continuously cheated on her mother a lot, and that her mother prayed to her to no avail, which is why Anura pretended to be a freak to ease her pain. Upon learning this, Alex decides to warm up to her. The next day, Alex is brought over to a personal hearing with the state minister John Vargeese (Kollam Thulasi), who berates him over his behavior while attempting to stop the riots. However, Alex stands up by berating Varghese for his belief to using his power to hurt others. Meanwhile, Madhu's father (Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair) reaches out to Prasad for filing a man missing complaint, resulting Prasad in discovering the body of Madhu in a decomposed stage with his camera, but the film is missing. As the investigation heats up, the local Member of Parliament Jayakrishnan (Murali) is struggling over the issues over the damaged area. However,...

Movie title: Phantasm II Movie plot: Picking up where the first movie left off, the Tall Man and his minions attempt to take Mike (James LeGros), but Reggie (Reggie Bannister) manages to save him after turning on the gas while the fireplace was on, blowing up the house.Six years later, the film introduces Liz Reynolds (Paula Irvine), a young woman with a psychic bond to Mike Pearson and the Tall Man that manifests in the form of prophetic nightmares. After she awakens from one, she looks at her dream journal, which includes drawings detailing characters and events from the first film; during this, she recalls a vision that picks up immediately where the first film ended: after the Tall Man's minions attacked Mike through his bedroom mirror, Reggie heard the commotion and ran upstairs to his aid. He tried to get a shotgun, but was attacked by Lurkers and had to flee, although he managed to surreptitiously snuff the pilot lights on the stove. Once upstairs, he dodged the Tall Man and rescued Mike, and the two dove out of the bedroom window to escape as the gas fumes reached the living room fireplace and destroyed the house. Following this, Liz pleads for Mike to find her, as she fears that when her grandfather dies, the Tall Man will take him.Having been institutionalized as delusional since the first film, Mike feels he can no longer ignore Liz's dream pleas, and fakes his recovery to obtain a doctor's release. At night, he returns to Morningside Cemetery to exhume bodies and is interrupted by Reggie who tells him that the attack at the beginning of the film never occurred. Mike reveals that the coffins he dug up are empty and urges Reggie to help him hunt the Tall Man down. En route to Reggie's house, Mike receives a vision of an impending gas explosion, and frantically tries to warn Reggie seconds before his house is consumed in an explosion, killing his wife Celeste, daughter Bonnie, and Aunt Marta. Mike's futile warning convinces Reggie that he is telling the truth and agrees to accompany Mike on his quest.They break into a hardware store at...","output":"In the movie \\"Phantasm II,\\" Mike (James LeGros) possesses psychic abilities. These abilities are initially revealed in the film through his connection with Liz Reynolds (Paula Irvine), as they experience prophetic nightmares and share a psychic bond with each other and the Tall Man. Mike's psychic abilities play a crucial role in the movie, as they help guide him to uncover the truth and piece together the events unfolding around him. Regarding the question of how Mike knew about the explosion that would kill Reggie's (Reggie Bannister) family, it can be inferred that Mike's psychic abilities allowed him to foresee this tragic event. As seen in the plot, after Mike received a vision of the impending gas explosion, he immediately tries to warn Reggie, though he is unsuccessful in preventing the catastrophe. This futile warning further convinces Reggie that Mike is telling the truth, leading Reggie to agree to accompany Mike on his quest to confront the Tall Man. In essence, Mike's psychic abilities provided him with insights on the various events and dangers they would encounter in their journey, including the devastating explosion at Reggie's house. It is through these psychic visions and the urgency to act on them that Mike, Reggie, and Liz are able to confront and tackle the evil forces of the Tall Man and his minions, despite the challenges and obstacles they face along the way."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

Please answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date.

A senior aide within Ed Miliband’s office who was blamed for the leader's embarrassing Hillsborough gaffe has become embroiled in an alleged bullying row, it has emerged. Anna Yearley, the Labour leader’s political secretary, has been accused of bullying Gemma Tumelty - a junior member of staff who worked as the party’s stakeholder relations manager. Ms Yearley, 35, is alleged to have treated the 33-year-old poorly, resulting in her leaving the party office last month, inside sources reportedly claimed. Anna Yearley (pictured), the Labour leader¿s political secretary, has been accused of bullying Gemma Tumelty - a junior member of staff who worked as the party's stakeholder relations manager. Ms Tumelty, the former president of the National Union of Students, is said to have received a ‘pay-off’ and signed a confidentiality agreement, The Times reported. It is alleged senior figures received an email informing them Ms Tumelty had resigned for family reasons and staff were asked not to contact her. Ms Yearley, who remains in post, works closely with Mr Miliband and acts as a liaison between the Labour leader and MPs. She became head of his political office after serving on his leadership campaign in 2010 and has previously worked as a member of Gordon Brown’s political staff. A spokesman speaking on behalf of the Labour party told MailOnline today: ‘We do not comment on staffing matters' and said Ms Yearley would not be making any comment on the matter. Gemma Tumelty, 33, who is the former president of the National Union of Students, is said to have received a 'pay-off' and signed a confidentiality agreement before leaving the position last month, it has been claimed. Ms Tumelty declined to comment when approached by The Times. The allegations come after Mr Miliband was forced to apologise last week after posing with a copy of The Sun. The Labour leader, who boasted of standing up to Mr Murdoch during the phone hacking scandal, attempted to mend fences in the run-up to the next election by posing with a World Cup souvenir edition of the tabloid. But the picture provoked anger among Labour activists, particularly in Liverpool, where the newspaper is boycotted due to its coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Ms Yearley was blamed for failing to predict the political fallout and the Labour leader was forced to issue an humiliating apology, saying he was ‘very, very sorry’ for causing offence. The apology capped a dismal week for the party leader. His new slogan ‘Hardworking Britain Better Off’ was condemned as ‘divisive’ at a meeting of Labour’s ruling national Executive Committee (NEC). Ms Yearley was blamed for failing to predict the political fallout after Labour leader Ed Miliband came under fire for posing with a copy of The Sun, which provoked anger among Labour activists, particularly in Liverpool. NEC member Ann Black said a poll she conducted of more than 200 party members found that 98 per cent ‘hated’ it because it appeared to criticise the unemployed. She said activists described the slogan as ‘divisive, meaningless’ and ‘sounding like a Tory slogan’. On immigration, senior Labour MP John Mann said that the ‘metropolitan elite’ had no idea about its impact on the lives of ordinary people. He accused Miliband and other members of the leadership of living ‘different lives to the voters whose support they need’. He also said the Labour leadership was ‘reluctant to recognise the downsides’ of mass immigration. MailOnline has contacted Ms Tumelty for comment. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Anna Yearley, a senior aide within Ed Miliband's office, has been accused of bullying Gemma Tumelty, a junior member of staff who worked as the party's stakeholder relations manager.

She is generally considered \\"cool\\" by you and your friends. This may indicate that she is easy-going, has a good sense of humor, or shares similar interests with your group. Her personality is likely to be approachable and compatible with the people around her. 2. Melissa is a smoker but prefers cigarettes over marijuana. While she may enjoy smoking as a social activity or a way to relax, she has either not tried cannabis or has chosen not to partake in it. There could be personal reasons, health concerns, or simple disinterest that keeps her from engaging in marijuana usage. 3. She has a positive impact on the people around her, as demonstrated by the story of Ramona cheering you up when you were down. This shows that Melissa is a caring and empathetic person, who can provide emotional support to her friends during difficult times. Her ability to relate to others and offer encouragement can create a comforting environment for those who know her. 4. Melissa might be open to trying new things, as you and your friends believe it is possible to “convert” her to embrace marijuana.

You also know that 30 years ago they had as much in common as Rush Limbaugh and Madonna. The story of how they came together this week on a street corner in Manhattan for a hunger strike is a glimpse of the evolution of the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the far-reaching impact of Iran's current opposition movement. Akbar Ganji went on a three-day hunger strike this week outside the U.N. to protest Iran's crackdown on dissidents. In 1979 no Iranian singer was more famous than Googoosh. She was Iran's Madonna, Sheryl Crow and Mariah Carey wrapped into one. She was rich, famous and adored by millions. Back then, the 29-year-old singer was also a symbol of an increasingly westernized Iran. \\"As an artist I have a voice, and I can ask the world to help our people,\\"","output":"Googoosh said, standing beside Akbar Ganji during the hunger strike. The two iconic figures, once so different in their lives and beliefs, had come together in Manhattan to support the cause of freedom and justice in Iran.

It was late when we returned home. I went to unlock the door and found my key wouldn't go in. I kept trying while my daughter went to get a flashlight. When she returned with it we found somehow the lock had been \\"stuffed\\" with sunflower seed shells. Thinking that one of the neighborhood children had been up to no good, I really didn't give it much consideration. I found all windows were locked up tight. So I returned to the back door. Oh my God, I will never forget the shock of that moment. The house was empty! Other than a few things remaining on the back porch, everything was gone! Then I heard a car pull into the driveway and found two policemen walking up. They inquired why I had broken into the house. They then asked me for proof that I lived at that address, so I asked them to wait a minute while I went to get my rent receipt and identification from inside the house. I explained the matter to them and showed them the door lock. I could tell from their actions and tone of voice that they thought I was breaking into an empty house for somewhere to sleep. I asked a neighbor for the phone number of house owner and the officer made a call. The owner was quite shocked to hear my story. She said that my roommate had been going through an eviction  process with the court when I moved in with her and had lost the case. She had been ordered to move by 10 am on that date. The court order had been issued the same day I had paid her 1/2 of the rent and a deposit of 300,000. The owner was very kind and understanding but there was nothing she could do. The house had been rented already and the people were to move in the following weekend. The officers let me go and I went to gather my girls into the car. They were both exhausted and old.

Soldiers from the Libyan National Army get ready to enter a compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 22, 2012. WASHINGTON (AP) -- For security reasons, FBI agents are staying away from the Libyan city where a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, two law enforcement officials said Friday. The officials say the bureau is not going to put agents in harm's way and that the city of Benghazi must be made secure before the FBI sends investigators there. The officials demanded anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record about an ongoing investigation. FBI agents were sent to Libya last week to look into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, a State Department computer expert and two former U.S. Navy SEAL commandos. At FBI headquarters Friday, spokesman Paul Bresson said \\"we are moving forward with our investigation,\\" but Bresson declined to comment on the specific location of the agents. Separately, the State Department is further reducing the U.S. Embassy staff in Tripoli for security reasons. The embassy warned Americans of possible demonstrations in the capital and Benghazi on Friday. On Thursday, Libya's leader said his government had disbanded about 10 militia groups and will continue to take action against Muslim extremists. President Mohammed el-Megarif said the attack on the U.S. Consulate earlier this month that killed the four Americans was a final straw. He did not say when the militias were disbanded, or how many remain. Copyright 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Around 1880, two young British officers arrive to join a regiment in India. One, Lieutenant Drake, from a middle-class background, is extremely eager to fit in while the other, Lieutenant Millington, the son of a general, is keen to get out as soon as possible and deliberately antagonizes his fellow officers. The two newcomers learn the traditions of the regiment, one of which is a mess game in which they chase a wooden pig on wheels, attempting to pierce its anus with their swords. Mrs Scarlett, the flirtatious and attractive widow of a captain who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, is a constant presence in the regiment.  One night at a mess dance, Millington gets drunk and tries to seduce Mrs Scarlett in the garden. She repels him, but moments later runs back into the mess wounded and in shock, claiming the culprit was Millington. An informal court martial -more a mock trial than anything else- is organized with Drake ordered to be Millington's defending officer. Although Drake is pressured by his superior officer to plead guilty for Millington and close the case quickly, he begins to challenge the orders in order to give the defendant a fair trial. Drake learns from an Indian servant that another widow suffered a similar attack with a sword six months earlier, before he and Millington joined. After irrefutable evidence, Mrs Scarlett finally admits it was not Millington who attacked her but will not say who the culprit is. Millington, now indisputably proved innocent, is welcomed back by his brother officers; but Drake, disgusted by the truth he's uncovered, resigns. One officer knows who the culprit is and, hiding Drake in the shadows so he may witness what is to take place, confronts the guilty man privately in the final scene.

Ymca staff take prospective members on guided tours of the site and can answer all membership questions. Services vary from one facility to another, so be sure to ask about programs of special interest to you.","output":"After visiting your local YMCA and taking a guided tour to determine if its facilities and services meet your needs, the next steps to become a member are as follows: 1. Assess your options: YMCA typically offers various membership types to cater to different age groups, family sizes, and individual needs. These may include individual, family, couple, senior, student, and corporate memberships. Review the options available at the YMCA you visited and determine which membership type best suits your needs and preferences. 2. Inquire about financial assistance: If the membership fees seem to be a financial burden for you or your family, check if the YMCA offers any financial assistance programs, subsidies, or sliding-scale fees that could make the membership more affordable. Many YMCA locations provide memberships to those facing financial challenges on a case-by-case basis. 3. Fill out the application form: To officially become a member, you will need to complete a membership application form. You can either pick up a physical form during your visit, download one from the YMCA website, or fill out an online application, depending on the options provided by your local YMCA. Carefully fill out all of the required fields, including your personal information, emergency contacts, payment method, and other preferences. 4. Read and accept terms and conditions: Before submitting your application, read and understand the terms and conditions associated with YMCA membership. These may include rules and regulations governing facility use, liability waivers and release forms, and cancellation policies, among others. Be sure to clarify any questions or concerns with a YMCA staff member before signing up. 5. Submit the application and pay the fees: Once you have completed the application form and agreed to the terms and conditions, submit the form (either in person or online) and pay the required fees. Membership fees typically include an initial joining fee and ongoing monthly fees, which are due regardless of your usage of the facilities. Payment options may include an automatic bank account deduction, credit card charge, or manual payment. 6. Attend a new member orientation: Many YMCA locations offer a new member orientation or introductory programs to familiarize you with the facilities, resources, and activities. Attending one of these sessions is a great opportunity to get to know other new members, learn about available programs and classes, and understand the member etiquette and expectations. 7. Get involved: Once you are officially a YMCA member, take advantage of the services, facilities, and programs available to you. Participate in group fitness classes, enroll in a sports league, join a special interest group, or volunteer for charitable projects through the YMCA. Being an active member will not only benefit your physical health but also contribute to a sense of community and belonging. Remember, your YMCA experience is what you make of it. By actively participating in the programs and services it offers, you will gain the most out of your YMCA membership, strengthen your physical and emotional well-being, and foster meaningful connections with others in your community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Millions of people given extortionate car parking charges outside train stations, NHS hospitals and supermarkets could be in line for a refund thanks to a new campaign. Cambridge law graduate Michael Green, 22, is leading a legal battle to have the 'fines' overturned in what could be Britain's largest ever group litigation. Private companies which run car parks outside some of Britain's biggest store chains - including Aldi, Lidl, B&Q and PC World - will often allow customers to park for free, but threaten a large fine for  exceeding a certain time limit. However, Mr Green believes that these fines are unlawful - and is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to go to the High Court and prove it. Clamping down: A new campaign is challenging extortionate penalty charge notices handed out by private companies outside hospitals, shops and train stations - and could get tens of millions of people a refund. If he wins the landmark legal case, then that could open the door for 'at least 10million people' to claim their money back, and could put a stop to the fines for good. He said: 'These \\"fines\\" are not official fines, but instead a matter of private law between two parties. 'When you park in a car park you are entering into a contract with the company which provides that parking space. 'If you breach a contract then under contract law that company is only allowed to make a claim for the amount they have actually lost. 'Because these spaces are free to park in, I would argue the amount is actually nothing. 'People take cases like this to the county court fairly regularly, and judges will often rule that the fines are unenforceable and the charge will be overturned. 'However, because of the way the county court system works, this will only settle the claim between one person and one company. 'By gathering the cases together, and taking it to the High Court, we can set a legal precedent.' When a judge made a similar ruling over PPI, it opened the door to a flood of claims that has seen banks set aside tens of billions of pounds in repayments. In the case of PPI, the ruling applied to 90 per cent of policies sold. Mr Green believes a new ruling could apply to 98 per cent of parking fines handed out by private companies. Raking it in: Money collected from parking charge notices has almost doubled in the last four years alone. Growing problem: Each time a private company issues a fine, they request the driver's details from the DVLA. This data shows that, in 2014 alone, nearly 2.7million fines will be issued. An estimated 2.2million such fines were handed out last year alone, and that number is set to rise to 2.7million this year. In total, it is estimated that these companies will collect around £127million in so-called 'fines' this year alone, almost double the £93million collected in 2010, and a 600 per cent increase on 2006, when just £21million was charged to motorists. Mr Green added: 'In my opinion [the charges] are unlawful. It is remarkable that the parking firms are happy to send out so many \\"fines\\", despite their legality not being clear. 'To make an estimated £176m industry out of this, without having clear legal precedent to do so, is concerning.' He is currently gathering interest on his Challenge the Fine website, before deciding whether to go ahead with the scheme. If enough people sign up, he will attempt to gather 100,000 cases together before going to court. He added: 'I think the law is pretty clear in this area, as evidenced by the conclusions of county court judges. 'But the law on how to organise such big cases is uncertain. We're going to be asking the judge some pretty novel questions so we might get some pretty novel answers.' Among the companies using the potentially illegal practices is UKPC, which manages spaces outside NHS hospitals, along high streets, and beside major retailers such as M&S and Tesco. Fighting back: Cambridge law graduate Michael Green is trying to gather 100,000 cases together to take to the High Court, which will make his case the biggest ever group litigation in UK history. Other companies include Parking Eye, which controls spaces outside many budget supermarkets including Asda, Lidl and Aldi, and Total Parking Services, which deals largely with shopping parks and stores such as B&Q and PC World. The companies will issue ‘parking charge notices’ – named to replicate official council ‘penalty charge notices’ – but which do not have the same legal standing as official fines. A growing number of people are refusing to pay, and because of this firms often follow the 'fines' with letters threatening court action, in the hope of browbeating people into submission. Simply ignoring the legal summons is not enough, and will often end up with a person being issued with a CCJ - which could prevent them from taking out loans or getting mortgages in the future. Mr Green, from Chatham in Kent, attended  Clare College at Cambridge University, earning a Bachelors degree in 2013, and passing a Law Masters in 2014, receiving some of the top grades in his year. Rather than begin training as a lawyer, he decided he wanted to start up a company giving everyday people greater access to the courts. The idea to help fight parking fines came to him after a friend was hit with an excessive charge. In the future, he also hope to help fight rouge telephone callers. One pensioner was hit with a £70 parking fine at a local NHS hospital after staying just 13 seconds too long. Marilyn Heald, pictured right, paid 50p to park for 30 minutes while she had an X-ray at the Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield last month. The 64-year-old from Staffordshire was shocked when a fine for £70 from Parking Eye landed on her doorstep a week later. Cameras had recorded her entering the car park – before she even had a chance to park – at 10.14am and 47 seconds. It logged her leaving at 10.45am, meaning she was penalised just over £5 for each of the 13 extra seconds. Mrs Heald said: ‘I have no problem in paying to park at the hospital. I’m all for the hospital making money from it. 'But I don’t understand why they’re using some car park management company, like Parking Eye, who are just there literally to cash in as soon as they can.’ Mrs Heald appealed and the fine was waived. She said: ‘It seems to me that if you appeal they let you off – that’s what’s happened to lots of people I know. 'They’re not interested in pursuing it at all, they’re just after catching the poor innocent person who is going to pay up.’ When Natalie Marshman’s two-year-old son fell seriously ill and began having fits, she rushed him to Ormskirk hospital a couple of miles away. The 37-year-old parked at the children’s A&E unit and ran inside with her son and eight-month-old daughter. On her return, she was horrified to find she had been given a £60 fine for parking in the drop-off bay. She said: ‘I was stunned. There was no way I could leave one of my children behind in the car and I had to get my son into the hospital as quickly as possible.’ Her son had an infection of his lymph nodes and needed treatment for the next three weeks. Mrs Marshman, pictured left, said: ‘I was shocked they would ticket someone who was clearly in an emergency, but they just said: “You should have got an ambulance”.’ The mother of three refused to pay the fine on ‘moral grounds’, but it was increased to £100 and she received threatening letters from UKPC warning her of legal action. She said: ‘It was causing me and my partner immense stress, so in the end we had to pay.’ Mrs Marshman added that she was relieved the aggressive practices at Ormskirk hospital had been reined in by the management. ‘It was a disgrace,’ she said. ‘Many of these people are very sick and yet they are being targeted by a firm looking to make a profit.’ An 80-year-old diabetic was targeted by McDonald’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at Gatwick airport. Charlie Webley, right with his daughter Sharon, needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely. Two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from MET Parking. It had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official DVLA database. After the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £50 to £100 because it was not paid within 14 days. Mr Webley, from Strood in Kent, had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter Sharon, who owns the car. Miss Webley, 54, said: ‘Effectively, we were sent a £100 penalty for over-staying by just 16 minutes.’ The civil servant launched a successful appeal to the independent tribunal service POPLA and the penalty was cancelled.

Write an article using the following points: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez hit with 10-game ban by English Football Association. Suarez has until Friday at midday GMT to appeal against punishment. Liverpool \\"shocked and disappointed\\" at decision. Article:","output":"Title: Liverpool Striker Luis Suarez Receives 10-game Ban: Club and Player Consider Appeal Intro: The English Football Association (FA) has imposed a hefty 10-game ban on Liverpool striker Luis Suarez following an incident during a recent match. The club and player have expressed their shock and disappointment at the decision. Suarez now has until Friday at midday GMT to appeal against the punishment. Para 1: Incident and Investigation Luis Suarez was charged by the FA for a biting incident in a match against another Premier League team. It has been widely reported that the Uruguayan international appeared to bite the arm of his opponent during a heated moment in the game. The FA launched an investigation into the matter, which led to the announcement of the 10-game ban. Para 2: Suarez's 10-game Suspension The FA's decision to impose a 10-game suspension on Suarez has come as a shock to many. The punishment is significantly more substantial than previous bans imposed for similar incidents. It has been speculated that the FA may have taken the player’s history into account when determining the length of his ban. This is not the first time Suarez has faced such a suspension – he had previously received a ban for a similar biting incident during his time playing in the Netherlands. Para 3: Liverpool's Reaction Liverpool Football Club has issued an official statement expressing their shock and disappointment at the FA's decision. The club believes that the length of Suarez's suspension is excessive and that it will severely impact their chances of success in the Premier League. They have begun to consult with the player, his representatives, and relevant legal professionals to explore the possibility of an appeal. Para 4: Suarez's Deadline to Appeal Suarez has been granted a deadline of Friday at midday GMT to appeal the FA's decision. Should the player choose to appeal, a legal battle will likely ensue to determine the validity of the ban and its duration. The outcome of any such appeal could have a significant impact on Liverpool's remaining season, as they fight for a place in European competitions. Conclusion: The 10-game ban imposed on Luis Suarez by the English Football Association has sent shockwaves through the football world. Liverpool's shock and disappointment at the decision is evident, and they are considering an appeal. Should Suarez choose to fight the ban, the coming days will be crucial in determining the future of Liverpool’s star striker and their hopes for success this season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves two seemingly unrelated events: leaving bread out in the air and global warming causing warmer winters. In this specific context, these two events would likely have little to no direct or indirect effect on the process of animal hibernation. Leaving bread out in the air might lead to spoilage and waste, but it does not directly influence global warming or animal hibernation. Global warming causing warmer winters can have an impact on the hibernation process, as warmer temperatures may alter the timing or duration of hibernation for some animals. However, this change in climate is not directly connected to leaving bread out in the air. In summary, while global warming causing warmer winters can influence the animal hibernation process, the proposed perturbation of leaving bread out in the air does not have a significant direct or indirect effect on this process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

Context: U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Sasse was joined Monday by two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.''

Would the answer to the question \\"How long does it take for your blood to make one complete trip through the body ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","output":"The answer to the question \\"How long does it take for your blood to make one complete trip through the body?\\" would be a numeric value. Blood circulation is a vital process in the human body and is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and other essential substances to different cells, tissues, and organs. It also helps in removing waste products like carbon dioxide and other toxins. The human circulatory system can be divided into two major circulatory systems: systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation. Systemic circulation is responsible for supplying oxygenated blood to the entire body (from the heart to various organs and then back to the heart), whereas pulmonary circulation is responsible for carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and back. In general, it takes about 20 to 30 seconds for blood to make a complete trip through the body, but the exact time it takes may vary depending on the individual's size, cardiovascular health, and metabolic rate. This numeric value includes the time it takes for blood to be pumped from the heart through the arteries, to the capillaries, and then returning to the heart via veins. The rate at which blood circulates in the body can be influenced by various factors, including age, physical fitness, and overall health. For example, athletes may have faster circulation due to improved cardiovascular health, while elderly people or those with certain chronic health conditions may experience slower blood circulation. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"How long does it take for your blood to make one complete trip through the body?\\" would be best represented as a numeric value, generally ranging from 20 to 30 seconds.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain? ?  Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1939, a woman dies while giving birth in a slaughterhouse, and the manager disposes the baby in a dumpster. A young woman, Luda Mae Hewitt, finds the child while searching for food. She takes him back to the Hewitt residence, names him Thomas, and decides to raise him as her own. Thirty years later, Thomas works in the same factory in which his real mother died, working for the same man who left him in the dumpster. He is informed that the plant has been shut down by the health department, but refuses to leave until the boss forces his assistant to make him leave. Later, Tommy returns and brutally murders his boss. Before leaving, Tommy finds a chainsaw. Luda Mae's son, Charlie Hewitt, learns from the town's Sheriff what Tommy has done and accompanies him to arrest him. When they find Tommy, Charlie kills the Sheriff and assumes his identity. He takes his body back home and butchers him for stew meat. He informs the rest of the family that they'll never go hungry again. Two brothers, Eric and Dean, are driving across the country with their girlfriends, Chrissie and Bailey, to enlist in the Vietnam War. At a diner, they meet a female biker named Alex, who later follows them. Dean reveals he's decided not to enlist and burns his draft card, right before Alex draws a shotgun and orders the group to pull over. A chase ensues and the car crashes; Chrissie is thrown from the Jeep and lands in a field out of sight. Hoyt arrives and immediately shoots Alex. Hoyt finds Dean's burnt draft card and demands to know who it belongs to. To save his brother, Eric claims that it's his. After making them put Alex's body in his car, Hoyt forces the group in as well, and calls for Uncle Monty to tow the wreckage, which Chrissie is hiding in. Hoyt drives them to the Hewitt house and has Tommy butcher Alex's...

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I never was an avid viewer of \\"Crocodile Hunter\\", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about Steve Irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. This movie, with Steve and his wife, Terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but I didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. Well, now I have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a BIT better. Apparently, it's supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn't very funny at all. A U.S. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! On Steve and Terri's mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when Steve sees the CIA agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers!  Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents. Apart from that, I don't think I found anything even mildly amusing. It's also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters, and it seems like clips from \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt, played by Magda Szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not. At one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a MAJOR cliché in modern comedy! Are they SO hard to resist?! I also found the typical \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" scenes, with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show didn't help. Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. No matter which side you're on, \\"The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course\\" is not a well crafted movie. I'm sure it does help if you're a big Steve Irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed. In fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have, so maybe it WON'T help. Like I said, there's no guarantee. I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. The attempt to combine what is usually seen in \\"Crocodile Hunter\\" with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!","output":"The sentiment of the given review is primarily negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie \\"The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course,\\" mentioning several aspects they found unimpressive and lacking.

Title: An under appreciated gem Review: For a young easterner living in Wichita, Kansas in the fall of 1976, this album was like a breath of fresh air. After several months of progressive (and not so progressive) country music I needed some rock 'n roll. Twilley's influences are very apparent on this disc, from rockabilly (\\"TV\\"), to The Beatles circa 1965 (\\"You Were So Warm\\") and 1966 (\\"Sincerely\\"). The \\"hit\\" single, \\"I'm On Fire\\" stills rings classic after 24 years. Twilley's talent was putting all of his influences into his music and blending them so well that they are not readily discernable. A great record and a solid artist who went away too quickly.PS: I bought this record to get some new rock 'n roll music, ended up buying three albums, all new, had never heard a note, bought by cover only. They were: Sincerely, Cheap Trick (their first), and Tom Petty & Heartbreakers (their first). Best record buying spree I've ever had! Is this product review negative? Answer:","output":"No, this product review is not negative. The reviewer seems to have a genuine appreciation for the album and speaks very positively about it. They mention that the album was \\"like a breath of fresh air\\" to them during a time when they were yearning for some rock 'n roll music. They also appreciate Twilley's talent of blending different music influences so seamlessly that they are not immediately distinguishable. The reviewer identifies specific tracks such as \\"TV,\\" \\"You Were So Warm,\\" and \\"Sincerely,\\" citing classic Beatles years as evident influences in these songs. They also make a specific note of the single \\"I'm On Fire,\\" stating that it still holds up and resonates with them even after 24 years.  They refer to Twilley as a \\"solid artist,\\" complimenting him with the phrase \\"A great record\\" - an evident positive affirmation of the album. Furthermore, the reviewer often refers to personal nostalgic experiences associated with the album, reinforcing their positive sentiments.  The review ends with the fact that this album was part of the purchase that resulted in their best record-buying spree, including the debuts of Cheap Trick and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, further suggesting their satisfaction with the product. Therefore, it is evident from their expressions of admiration and praise towards the album and the artist that this review is positively inclined rather than negative."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

One specific version of the Adult Contemporary format, which is often associated with Christmas music, is called the \\"Soft AC\\" or \\"Lite AC\\" format. Soft AC or Lite AC stations are known to shift their programming to emphasize holiday music during the Christmas season, which generally begins after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. These stations primarily play popular seasonal songs, both contemporary and classic, by various artists. The passage provided mentions some of the popular artists whose holiday music is played on these stations during the season, such as Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, The Carpenters, Percy Faith, Johnny Mathis, and Andy Williams. So, to answer your question, the specific AC format that is especially known for playing Christmas music during the Christmas season is the Soft AC or Lite AC format. The passage does not explicitly mention this, but the information given about the type of Christmas songs played on some radio stations suggests that it is likely referring to Soft AC or Lite AC stations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: A study of haplotypes of the Y-chromosome, published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer et al. found that the Y-chromosome of Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews contained mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with \\"relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,\\" and a total admixture estimate \\"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.\\" This supported the finding that \\"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\" \\"Past research found that 50–80 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,\\" Richards said.

You know how it works. Instead of thinking thoughts that are helpful and rational you end up thinking things like, \\"I'm a complete failure -- I'll never amount to anything regardless of what I do, so why bother trying?\\" Here's some news for you: Those thoughts are not facts. They are feelings. And feelings can change. When you catch yourself thinking something negative, either force yourself to immediately stop it in its tracks or add on something to make it better. \\"I'm a complete failure\\" turns into, \\"I'm a complete failure at this one thing today. Tomorrow is another story.\\" Take yourself out of the black and white. Nothing is 100%. When they said, \\"This too shall pass,\\" this is what they were talking about. Between naps and box sets of the Golden Girls, it's easy to lose track of who you once were. In order to snap out of the rut, you gotta do things that you may not want to do -- and keeping up your old (pre-rock bottom) life is one of them. If you used to play music, force yourself to play music. If you used to love cooking, cook. It may be the last thing you want to do, but rediscovering what once brought you joy could be just the catalyst for change you need. In addition to keeping up old habits (the good ones), new ones work just as well! Staying active (both physically and mentally) will force you out of this lackluster, lethargic thought-path you've been squeezed into. Are there any opportunities at your school or workplace? Is a friend trying something out that seems interesting to you? What could be a valuable way to spend your free time? In other words, what could distract you? That dang villain called lethargy strikes daily. Morning rolls around and the only reason to get out of bed is to go to the bathroom. This is where the to-do list comes in handy. On it, write all the little things you want to accomplish for the day. It doesn't have to be world-changing, it just has to get you out of bed and being productive. It all depends on where you are in the process. It could be something like \\"send in 5 applications, \\"go for a 2 mile (3.2 km) run,\\" or \\"talk to a new person.\\" Think of a few things you'd like to see come to life in the near future -- what are small things you could do every day to achieve them? Another trick to get out of your world and more wrapped up in the world of others (which can be a much less scary and intimidating place) is to help others. Not only will you make them feel good, but making them feel good will make you feel good. Instant gratification. Seek out the little opportunities in addition to the bigger ones. Offering to walk an elderly neighbor's dog, helping a pregnant woman with her groceries, help someone in your family -- all these little deeds add up. You'll gain a sense of purpose, possibly make friends, and just make the world better. That's three wins in one. It's very possible that the crowd you're around is to blame for this rocky place you're up against. Hate to break it to you, but those around us can be total drains on our potential. Is it possible the relationships you have are making you a little worse for the wear? If the answer is even a maybe, it'll be best for you to put your efforts elsewhere. Sometimes it's necessary to end toxic friendships. We grow as people and our friends don't meet these new identities we find. It's totally normal. If any of your friends (or significant others) don't fill you with joy, maybe it's time for them to go. Obviously this is easier said than done, but if your present circumstances are highly dictated by location (no job opportunities, no friends to speak of), you may want to consider moving -- if it's financially feasible. It doesn't have to be a big move, but a change of scenery could do you some serious good. What better way to rejuvenate you than to rejuvenate all of your senses? With a move, soon enough you'll forget all about your former life. Who were you once, anyway? If bad memories are associated with where you are currently, give this idea serious thought. Is there anywhere you could go but still maintain your support network? Sit down with yourself and ask if this process (arduous though it may be) would be worthwhile. It's like getting handed a whole new world.

Article: We Chat, the Chinese social media smartphone app, saw an increase in user numbers of 41 per cent year on year to 500m at the end of 2014, in a sign that parent company Tencent is extending  its reach for the mobile internet. Revenue grew 24 per cent to Rmb20.98billion, slightly higher than forecasts, driven mainly by online gaming revenues. It is unclear how much WeChat contributed to Tencent's revenues but the app's growth is a strong indicator of the company's long-term health as it tries to adjust its business to be more suitable for mobile devices. \\"We extended our leadership in games and online media, and made breakthroughs in emerging platforms such as online security . . . and mobile payments,\\" Ma Huateng, Tencent chairman, said in a statement. WeChat is the second highest ranked app in China, behind QQ, Tencent's other chatting app, which claimed to have 815m registered monthly users at the end of 2014. However, that figure is more than the total number of internet users in China, which the government puts at 640million. Tencent has been unwilling to earn money through WeChat by flooding it with advertising, which could reduce efforts to increase the user base. But this is expected to change. Some analysts predicted that advertising would be introduced on later this year. Early attempts to test ads on the service have not always gone smoothly.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.

Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Persian: syd rwHllh mwswy khmyny [ru:hol'la:he khomei'ni:] ( listen); 24 September 1902 - 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader and politician. He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.  Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.  On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country.  On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August. Entity:","output":"Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, also known as Ayatollah Khomeini"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, Burt Johnson, a middle-aged, clumsy but well-intentioned mechanic, is struggling to keep his small garage business running. As a big fan of Julio's and ecstatic about the upcoming event, Burt amasses every ounce of courage he has to petition Julio's team for a chance to work on their prized race car, the \\"Speedster Falcon\\".  Surprisingly, Julio's team agrees to have Burt join their team as an assistant mechanic under one condition - he will only observe and assist when needed. Elated, Burt takes on the challenge to prove his abilities to the world and make his mark. Somewhere in the shadows of the racing circuit, a disgruntled rival, Rico Velez, plots to take Julio down, and with that, his team's chances at the championship. Through his connections, he discovers Burt's miraculous appointment on Julio's team and hatches a cunning plan to use Burt's inexperience as a means to sabotage Julio's car. As Burt works closely with the team, he develops a strong friendship with Julio and the rest of the crew, who begin to see the potential in him. On the day of the race, Burt is given a rare chance to run the final inspection on the Speedster Falcon. Overwhelmed by the trust placed on him, Burt completely misses the critical flaw that Rico strategically planted - a wire tied around the main axle. The race begins, and as Julio speeds towards victory, the wire suddenly snaps, completely disabling the Speedster Falcon and sending it rolling off the track. Miraculously, Julio survives the crash, and the racing community is left baffled by this unforeseen turn of events.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   Would a microphone designed to listen for avalanches detect the sound of falling snow sooner on a warm day or colder day??    Assuming that:  For a given medium such as air, sound has a slower speed at lower temperatures. Answer:","output":"A microphone designed to listen for avalanches would detect the sound of falling snow sooner on a warm day compared to a colder day. To answer this question, it is important to understand the factors that affect the speed of sound and how temperature plays a role in it. The speed of sound in a medium like air depends on its temperature and the specific properties of the medium. In general, the speed of sound increases with the temperature of the air. This is because the air molecules move faster when they are warm, leading to increased energy transfer during collisions, which causes the sound waves to propagate faster through the air. Here's a breakdown of the speed of sound in air at different temperatures: 1. At 20°C (68°F), the speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second (1,125 feet per second). 2. At 0°C (32°F), the speed of sound is approximately 331 meters per second (1,086 feet per second). 3. At -20°C (-4°F), the speed of sound is approximately 318 meters per second (1,043 feet per second). As we can see from these figures, the speed of sound gets slower as the temperature decreases. On a colder day, sound will travel more slowly through the air compared to a warmer day. This means that, for the same distance, it will take longer for the sound of falling snow to reach the avalanche-detection microphone on a colder day compared to a warmer day. Additionally, the temperature can also affect the snow's properties and the avalanches' behavior. In colder temperatures, the snow tends to be more cohesive, which means it can pile up before it breaks away and starts an avalanche. In warmer temperatures, the snow may be less cohesive and more prone to start small avalanches, increasing the chances of the microphone detecting the sound of falling snow sooner. Another factor that may influence the microphone's ability to detect the sound of falling snow is the ambient noise level. On a warm day, there may be more background noise from increased human activity, wildlife, or wind, which might make it more difficult for the microphone to accurately detect and identify the sound of falling snow or an avalanche compared to a colder day when these sounds may be less common. In conclusion, the speed of sound being faster on a warm day than on a colder day and the potential for more frequent small avalanches on warmer days make it more likely for an avalanche-detection microphone to detect falling snow sooner on a warm day than on a colder day. However, it is important to note that the ambient noise level and other environmental factors can also influence the microphone's ability to detect falling snow and potential avalanches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A traditional market town in the heart of the Portes du Soleil, Morzine is dominated by chalets spread across a river gorge, bordered by partially wooded slopes allowing skiing in poor weather conditions. Situated at an altitude of 1000 m, it is one of the most northerly of the French Alpine resorts, and weatherwise benefits from the Mont Blanc microclimate. The locality enjoys panoramic mountain views and modern ski facilities, as well as hotels and restaurants in the town itself. The ski resort of Avoriaz is located on the territory of the commune.   - Alpine Ski () is an Alpine skiing arcade game, released by Taito in 1981.  - Les Portes du Soleil (French for \\"The Doors of the Sun\\") is a major skisports destination in the Alps, encompassing thirteen resorts between Mont Blanc in France and Lake Geneva in Switzerland. With more than 650 km of marked pistes (claimed by the lift companies; an independent expert measured about 426 km ) and about 200 lifts in total, spread over 14 valleys and about , Portes du Soleil ranks among the two largest ski areas in the world (the other being Les Trois Vallées). Almost all of the pistes are connected by lifts  a few marginal towns can be reached only by the free bus services in the area. The highest point of skiing is 2400 m and the lowest is 900 m.  As with many other Alpine ski resorts, the lower slopes of the Portes du Soleil have snow-making facilities to extend the skiable season by keeping the lower slopes open during the warmer months.  - Skiing is a mode of transport, recreational activity and competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).  - Ski mountaineering is a skiing discipline that involves climbing mountains either on skis or carrying them, depending on the steepness of the ascent, and then descending on skis. There are two major categories of equipment used, free-heel Telemark skis and skis based on Alpine skis, where the heel is free for ascents, but is fixed during descent. The discipline may be practiced recreationally or as a competitive sport.  - Avoriaz (or ) is a French mountain resort in the heart of the Portes du Soleil. It is located in the territory of the commune of Morzine. It is easily accessible from either Thonon at Lake Geneva or Cluses-junction on the A40 motorway between Geneva and Chamonix. Either way one follows the D902, Route des Grandes Alpes, to Morzine and then the D338 running from Morzine to Avoriaz. Snow chains are often necessary. Avoriaz is built on a shelf high above the town of Morzine, which is among the pioneering towns of skiing with its first lifts dating back to the early 1930s.  Today Avoriaz is one of the major French ski destinations catering for all standards of skiing and ranks among the top snowboarding destinations of the world. Apart from snow-based pursuits, Avoriaz is also a centre for trekking, golf, VTT (mountain biking) and other outdoor activities during the summer.  Cars are forbidden in Avoriaz. The station is designed to be fully skiable. Other transport around the resort includes horse-drawn sleighs during winter and snow caps.  - The term mountaineering describes the sport of mountain climbing, including ski mountaineering. Hiking in the mountains can also be a simple form of mountaineering when it involves scrambling, or short stretches of the more basic grades of rock climbing, as well as crossing glaciers.  - The 2007 European Championship of Ski Mountaineering ( French : Championnat d'Europe de ski de montagne 2007 ) was the seventh European Championship of ski mountaineering and was held in Avoriaz , Morzine between the Mont Blanc and the Lac Léman from March 24 - 28 . The competition was organized by the Fédération française de la montagne et de lescalade ( FFME ) ordered by the International Council for Ski Mountaineering Competitions ( ISMC ) of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme ( UIAA ) . About 230 athletes of 21 nations participated . Compared to the 2005 European Championship the vertical race and the relay race event also ranked .  - A mountain resort is a place to holiday or vacation located in a mountainous area. The term includes ski resorts, where winter sports, including skiing, snowboarding, ice climbing and ice skating are practiced, as well as places where summer activities such as mountain biking, mountain boarding, and hiking are pursued. In hot climates hill and mountain resorts are visited for the cooler temperatures at higher elevations.    What is the relationship between '2007 european championship of ski mountaineering' and 'skiing'? A:","output":"The 2007 European Championship of Ski Mountaineering and skiing have a tightly interwoven relationship, as the former is an event deeply based on the latter. Skiing forms the very base of ski mountaineering, and thus, any championship of ski mountaineering, including the 2007 European Championship, has its roots in skiing itself. Skiing is a beloved winter sport and mode of transportation that involves moving over snow using a pair of long, flat runners or skis attached to boots or bindings. The sport can either be competitive or recreational and is internationally recognized with various types of events such as cross-country, freestyle, alpine, and ski mountaineering recognized by entities like the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS). At this juncture, it's crucial to mention that ski mountaineering is a unique category of skiing that involves climbing mountains and descending on skis. During the ascent, the skier may have skis on or needs to carry them based on how stiff the climb is, while during the descent, the skier travels down on skis – a clear intersection of skiing and mountaineering. The equipment used can vary, including free-heel Telemark skis or those based on Alpine skis where the heel is free during ascents and fixed during descents. The activity can be for recreational purposes or as an exciting, energy-demanding competitive sport. Therefore, the 2007 European Championship of Ski Mountaineering is an advanced form of skiing competition where athletes compete at extreme levels, displaying their abilities to not only traverse and maneuver down snow-covered mountain terrain, but also scale mountainous surfaces under challenging conditions. The Championship was held in Avoriaz, Morzine, in the heart of the French Alps. The event was overseen by the Fédération française de la montagne et de l'escalade (FFME) and was sanctioned by the International Council for Ski Mountaineering Competitions (ISMC) of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA). To sum it up, ski mountaineering, from which the 2007 European Championship stems, is a highly specialized and challenging extension of skiing, as it requires aspects of mountaineering to be integrated with skiing skills. Hence, the relationship between the two is founded on the fact that ski mountaineering, and by extension, the Championship, wouldn't exist without the fundamental sport of skiing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(AFP/Getty Images) Azerbaijan's big presidential election, held on Wednesday, was anticipated to be neither free nor fair. President Ilham Aliyev, who took over from his father 10 years ago, has stepped up intimidation of activists and journalists. Rights groups are complaining about free speech restrictions and one-sided state media coverage. The BBC's headline for its story on the election reads \\"The Pre-Determined President.\\" So expectations were pretty low. Even still, one expects a certain ritual in these sorts of authoritarian elections, a fealty to at least the appearance of democracy, if not democracy itself. So it was a bit awkward when Azerbaijan's election authorities released vote results – a full day before voting had even started. The vote counts – spoiler alert: Aliyev was shown as winning by a landslide – were pushed out on an official smartphone app run by the Central Election Commission. It showed Aliyev as \\"winning\\" with 72.76 percent of the vote. That's on track with his official vote counts in previous elections: he won (\\"won\\"?) 76.84 percent of the vote in 2003 and 87 percent in 2008. The Azerbaijani Central Election Commission sent out these vote totals to its official smartphone app before voting started. (meydan.tv) In second place was opposition candidate Jamil Hasanli with 7.4 percent of the vote. Hasanli had recently appealed to the Central Election Commission for paid airtime on state TV, arguing that Aliyev gets heavy airtime and the opposition does not. He was denied. The data were quickly recalled. The official story is that the app's developer had mistakenly sent out the 2008 election results as part of a test. But that's a bit flimsy, given that the released totals show the candidates from this week, not from 2008. You might call this a sort of Kinsley gaffe on a national scale. (A Kinsley gaffe, named for journalist Michael Kinsley, is when a politician gets in trouble for saying something that's widely known as true but that he isn't supposed to say.) There's supposed to be a certain ritual to an election like Azerbaijan's: demonstrations are put down, reporters are harassed, opposition candidates are whittled down, supporters are ushered to the polls and then Aliyev's sweeping victory is announced. They got the order wrong here. As of this writing, Azerbaijan's election authorities say they've counted 80 percent of the ballots, with Aliyev winning just under 85 percent of the vote so far. He's been officially reelected. • An infographic guide to Syria’s chemical weapons and how they work • North Korea’s nuclear program just became self-sufficient.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home. Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him.

Back then, a CBS News poll showed Hillary Clinton beating Bernie Sanders nationally by nearly 20 points; if Joe Biden had entered the race, the same poll suggested Clinton would beat Sanders by 24 points. She was, in the minds of many liberal voters, the inevitable Democratic nominee. Another CBS News poll showed Donald Trump with a slim six-point lead over Dr Ben Carson nationally and, after two almost cartoonish debate performances, most Republicans and pundits expected the businessman’s numbers to slide and eventually eliminate him from contention. Quietly on that same day, the New York state board of elections’ deadline to change party affiliation passed, leaving any registered voters not identified as a Republican or a Democrat with no way to vote in the 19 April 2016 primary. The deadline to register to vote for the first time in the New York primary passed on 25 March 2016; there is no in-person registration in the state, even to cast a provisional ballot. As New York’s primary approaches, it is only now that many would-be voters are realizing they will be unable to vote next Tuesday. New York is one of only 11 states with closed primaries – ie primaries in which only voters who are registered as Republicans or Democrats are allowed to cast ballots – and it is the only state in which currently registered voters must declare their party affiliation more than six months before a primary in order to vote. Related: The Clintons of Chappaqua: it's Hillary's home turf, but Bill still shines More than 2.9 million of New York’s 10.7 million active voters were not registered Democrats or Republicans as of April 2016 – in part because at least some of them found out after 9 October 2015 that, beginning that day, they could not change their party affiliation until 15 November. That number includes both Eric and Ivanka Trump, who revealed this week that they will be unable to cast a ballot for their own father in their home state primary. In a statement, they called the process to change affiliation “one of the most onerous” in the country and said: “Our experience in New York, and inability to change our party affiliation so that we could vote for our father in the NY primary, was the reason that we proactively began making videos last year to educate voters on a state-by-state basis on what is required in order for them to vote in their own state primaries.” But you don’t have to be a child of a Republican frontrunner to find yourself unable to vote in next week’s primary. Elisabeth Garber-Paul is a 29-year-old journalist in Brooklyn who registered to vote as a member of the Working Families Party years ago only to discover in New York City’s last mayoral election that she was unable to vote in the Democratic primary. She wasn’t going to let that happen again in 2016. “When I renewed my driver’s license in October, I changed my party affiliation, specifically so I could vote for Bernie Sanders,” she explained. “It came back just fine, everything seemed to be in order, and I was excited to vote this spring.” It wasn’t until last month, after reading press coverage about the voter registration deadline, that Garber-Paul thought to double-check her status – only to discover she’d missed the voter affiliation change deadline (of which she was unaware) by about a week. “The most frustrating part to me was that neither the state website nor the Democratic party [notified] me that the registration was invalid,” she said. “This feels like a bullshit way to disenfranchise people in the primary,” she added. “Given that our presidential elections are two-party affairs, it seems pretty disingenuous to make it so hard for voters to participate.” Megan B, a 38-year-old teacher in upstate New York who preferred not to use her last name, agreed. “The process of voting (in a primary, especially) in New York is challenging and difficult to navigate,” she said. “It’s almost as if only the well-educated, connected and motivated voter is welcome at the primary polls.” Megan, a lifelong voter, has never tried to vote in a primary before – “I didn’t want to classify myself as one [party] or the other” she said – but has been following the primaries more closely this year than in the past. “I’m inspired to vote this year because I support Senator Sanders,” she explained. Though she has known for a few months that she would be ineligible to vote next week unless she registered as part of the Democratic party, it wasn’t until last week that she attempted to research how to do so and discovered it was too late. “Given all of this, I’m volunteering at a phone bank for Senator Sanders’ presidential campaign on Saturday to help get the word out to registered Democrats eligible to vote in the primaries,” she said. Both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns tried to alert supporters to the deadlines, first in October for registered voters and then in March for new voters. “We registered a bunch of voters before the deadline,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for Sanders. “[Our volunteers] have been working to try to make sure it doesn’t get in folks’ way,” he added, noting that many volunteers were working to alert voters about the deadlines in New York before the campaign opened an office here. Dale M, a 30-year-old staff attorney with a not-for-profit group in Brooklyn, did not get alerted in time, though he did know that he’d have to change his affiliation to Democratic to be eligible to vote for Sanders in the April primary. “So, I changed my designation to ‘Democrat’ over the internet around December of last year, or so I thought.” But when he received a written confirmation by mail, he was still listed as unaffiliated. “I did some research and found information that [said] I needed to go in person to my local district council office” to change his affiliation. “I went in person on my lunch hour and, lo and behold, was told for the very first time that my party designation can only ever be changed during November each year,” he explained. Technically, though, he was still given incorrect information, as New York state requires that changes in party affiliation to be sent in “no later than 25 days before the general election”, placed in a sealed box “and opened the first Tuesday following that general election and entered in the voter’s registration record”. “Our voter registration system is way more of a complicated and inaccessible system than it should be,” he said. Kayla Santosuosso is a 26-year-old political organizer in Brooklyn who has been unaffiliated since she registered to vote in New York in 2012. She said that the affiliation deadline caught her unawares. “I heard nothing about the party change deadline, and I work in this field.” She says she didn’t decide to vote in the primary until mid-November, after seeing Sanders’ performance in one of the Democratic debates. “I actually mailed in my registration the moment I felt convinced, which I think was mid-November,” she explained. And, like Dale and Garber-Paul, she heard nothing back directly until, as she said in a blogpost, she decided to double-check her eligibility with the state last week and discovered she was still listed as unaffiliated. From there, she called the Fair Elections Legal Network, then the state board of elections and finally the county board of elections, who then told her that she’d sent in her change of affiliation too late and it wouldn’t take effect until after the next general election. “I’m furious,” she said. In her blogpost, she wrote: “I don’t think it’s a stretch to say that maze-like election laws like these are the reason that voter turnout is so disastrous in New York state and nationwide.” Tom Connolly of the New York state board of elections admitted that “any kind of issue we have on a year-to-year basis is exacerbated in an election year” and that the board was receiving many calls from voters at the moment. But he said the deadline was a matter of statute and thus could only be changed by the New York legislature, which they encourage upset voters to contact. “We do try to provide that information to callers when they are upset,” he said, noting that Governor Andrew Cuomo floated a proposal to change the deadlines in his 2015 state of the state address and that various legislators have introduced bills in the past to little avail. The constitutionality of the deadline for party affiliation changes was upheld by the state supreme court in 1973. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"In New York, there is a rule that registered voters must declare their party affiliation more than six months before a primary election in order to vote. This is causing many people to feel frustrated because they can't participate in the upcoming primary election on April 19. New York is one of only 11 states with closed primaries, which means only voters registered as Republicans or Democrats are allowed to vote.

However, we do know a lot about languages, the languages of today and also the languages of earlier times. There are probably about 3,000 languages in the world today. Chinese is the language with the most speakers. English, Russian and Spanish are also spoken by many millions of people. On the other hand, some languages in the world have less than one hundred speakers. There are several important families of languages in the world. For example, most of the languages of Europe are in one large family called Indo-European. The original   language of this family was spoken about 4,500 years ago. Many of the present day languages of Europe and India are modern forms of the language of 4,500 yeas ago. Languages are always changing. The English of today is very different from the English of 500 years ago. In time some even died out completely. About 1,000 years ago, English was a little-known relative of German spoken on one of the borders of Europe. If a language has a large number of speakers or if it is very old, there may be differences in the way it is spoken in different areas. That is, the language may have several dialects. Chinese is a good example of _ differences. Chinese has been spoken for thousands of years by many millions of speakers.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999.

Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

The move involved 30 freestyle athletes travelling down a short slope and then performing a backflip before landing on their feet further down the slope.      Videos of the stunt were posted on Facebook and YouTube and it soon had hundreds of re-posts from impressed viewers.      One Facebook user, Genevieve Tougas, commented: \\"Wow! Good job guys. A great video to keep for your archives.\\"      The attempt took place at the ski resort of Mont St Sauveur in Quebec, Canada, which is considered the home of the region's ski industry.      It was organised by Mogul freestyle skiing world cup champion Mikaël Kingsbury, who also took part.      A total of 30 skiers took part in the backflip (Pic: Mont St-Sauveur Intl)      Another skier, Jérôme Bernèche, 23, said: \\"Mikaël had this idea a month or so ago and created a Facebook group where he invited the people he knew that could do a backflip easily enough to be confident doing it holding hands.      \\"When he saw there was interest, he contacted the mountain to see if they could build us a jump wide enough and close a part of a slope for a day.      \\"They were kind enough to help us with this idea and made it happen.\\"      He said many of those who took part were current or ex-members of the Canadian freestyle skiing team.      Mr Bernache said they trained for two hours alone or in pairs or small groups until they had got the feeling for the jump before getting together to complete the jump in a line.      The skiers celebrated afterwards with a slap-up lunch      The group made two attempts. The first ended in failure - but they succeeded with the second.      Mr Bernache said: \\"On the first try, the line broke, because we had problems with the angle of the slope that was steeper on one side than the other, so some people did not have the same speed.      \\"On the second try, everyone landed and the line didn't break, everybody landed hand in hand.      \\"We were pretty stoked, I don't think anybody really expected it to work that well. We went for lunch (and) got a big poutine (typical Canadian dish) to celebrate.\\"      He said Mikael had hoped to get it into the Guinness Book of World Records, but they were too late this time round so would try again next year.      \\"We're still confident we broke the world record, though,\\" he added. ||||| Summary:","output":"A group of 30 skiers did a really big trick all at the same time.

Article: The Tories would allow children to go to school for ten hours a day and on Saturday mornings to improve the performance of poorer pupils and help working parents. Schools spokesman Michael Gove declared plans yesterday to give disadvantaged children more classroom time to help them catch up. Longer school days could also be popular with parents who struggle to fit 3pm school finishing times around work, he said.  Mr. Gove gave out the success of a U.S. plan where teenagers from poor backgrounds attend school from 7.30 am to 5pm. \\"I believe that having children in school for longer, particularly if they come from disadvantaged backgrounds can help them to achieve more in academy, \\" he told the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Manchester. He pointed out that it was up to schools alone to decide whether to open longer, or at weekends. But he was greeted with laughter from delegates  when he said the plan would really work only with the active support of teachers.  ATL general secretary, Dr Mary Bousted, said, \\"The last thing we need to be doing at the present time is increasing teachers' working hours. Teachers already work the most unpaid overtime of any public sector profession. If we want Saturday schools then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer and becoming tired.\\" Meanwhile Mr Gove's idea is likely to alarm those concerned about the erosion( )of family time.

El proceso de modificación implicó adaptar los air speeders T-47 al frígido ambiente de Hoth con un enfoque en tres áreas principales: Protección contra el frío, maniobrabilidad mejorada y equipamiento de combate. 1. Protección contra el frío: En el gélido ambiente de Hoth, los motores, sistemas electrónicos y pilotos necesitaban protección adicional para evitar fallos debido al intenso frío. Para solucionar esto, los ingenieros diseñaron sistemas de calefacción especializados para motores y componentes internos, así como trajes mejorados para el piloto y copiloto. 2. Maniobrabilidad mejorada: Para permitir una mayor maniobrabilidad en el terreno nevado, los snowspeeders contaban con un repulsor de onda de choque que les permitía mantenerse estables en altitudes bajas, incluso por encima de la gruesa capa de nieve. También se incorporaron flaps de control y deflectores para mejorar la estabilidad y control en vuelo. 3. Equipamiento de combate: Con el fin de estar listos para enfrentar al Imperio en caso de un ataque, los snowspeeders fueron equipados con cañones láser y un sistema de control de fuego que les permitía a los pilotos seleccionar objetivos y cantidad de potencia de disparo de acuerdo a las necesidades específicas de cada situación bélica. Además de estas modificaciones, los snowspeeders también contaban con un arco de harpón y cabrestante, que demostraron ser muy efectivos en la Batalla de Hoth al derribar los gigantes caminantes AT-AT del Imperio, al enredar sus patas y hacerlos caer. En resumen, la adaptación de los T-47 air speeders a snowspeeders en Hoth fue esencial para la supervivencia y éxito de las tropas rebeldes.

Here's the step-by-step process: 1. Combine terms containing n on the left side of the equation: (-682 * n) + (-603 * n) + (1606 * n) can be simplified by combining the coefficients: (-682 - 603 + 1606) * n This simplifies to: 321 * n So, the left side of the equation is now: 321 * n 2. Now let's rewrite the equation with the simplified left side: 321 * n = 510 * n + 3213 3. Now isolate n by moving the term containing n from the right side of the equation to the left side: 321 * n - 510 * n = 3213 We can combine the terms containing n on the left side: (321 - 510) * n = 3213 This simplifies to: -189 * n = 3213 4.

Question 1: What can a hacker do with an IP address? Question 2: Is a private IP address also a static IP address? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions are not the same as they refer to different aspects of IP addresses. Let me provide you with detailed answers to both questions: Question 1: What can a hacker do with an IP address? An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to devices to communicate over a network. While having an IP address alone doesn't give hackers complete control, they can still utilize it for various malicious activities. Here are some things a hacker might do with an IP address: 1. Geolocation: By using an IP address, a hacker can determine the approximate location of a device. While this information is not highly accurate, it provides a general idea of the city or region where a device resides. 2. Scanning for vulnerabilities: With an IP address, hackers can scan for open ports, security loopholes, or weak software versions on a device. This information allows them to plan a targeted attack with higher chances of success. 3. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: Hackers can use a victim's IP address to launch a DDoS attack, overwhelming their network resources and causing their internet connection to become slow or unresponsive. 4. Phishing and social engineering: By knowing the approximate location of an IP address, hackers might craft more convincing phishing emails or use social engineering techniques based on the demographic or cultural context. 5. IP spoofing: Hackers might also use an IP address to impersonate a legitimate device on a network, which could enable them to bypass security measures, intercept sensitive information, or perform malicious activities under someone else's identity. Question 2: Is a private IP address also a static IP address? Private and static IP addresses are different concepts, though they can coexist. Let's understand their individual meanings: 1. Private IP address: A private IP address is reserved for internal use within a local area network (LAN) and is not routable over the internet. These addresses are typically assigned by a router or other network equipment and are not directly accessible from the internet. The main purpose of a private IP address is to allow multiple devices within a network to communicate with each other. There are three main IPv4 address ranges reserved for private IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. 2. Static IP address: A static IP address is an IP address that does not change over time, in contrast to a dynamic IP address, which may change periodically due to DHCP lease expiration or device reconnection. Static IP addresses can be public or private, depending on the scope of their use and accessibility. A private IP address can be static or dynamic. A private static IP address is usually assigned to devices such as servers, printers, or other network equipment that require a consistent IP address for proper functioning within the LAN. This static address ensures that devices can reliably connect to these resources without the risk of the IP address changing unexpectedly. In conclusion, the answers to these two questions are not the same, as one question discusses potential exploits with an IP address, while the other question focuses on the relationship between private and static IP addresses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If he's always asking you what he should do about one girl or another, then he may just view you as a friend. Try to change the subject and show him that you're girlfriend material. There's a difference between dropping hints that you'd like him to ask you out and being very obvious about how much you want to go on a date. If you're too obvious, you won't leave anything to the imagination, and you won't seem as desirable.  Avoid lavishing him with attention. He will be overwhelmed and it's better to play it cool. Avoid constantly asking him to hang out. If he's not responding, he may not be feeling it. Avoid talking about how free your weekends are or how flexible your schedule is. Instead, talk about all the fun plans you have ahead. He should feel like he should try to squeeze into your busy schedule if he wants to see you, not like you're waiting around for something fun to do. If you really want the guy to ask you out and feel like you've been dropping hints and letting him know you want to go out forever, then there are two things you can do.  Move on.

He keeps calm except for his eyes, which twitch uncontrollably, and departs.A day or two later, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney), a local writer, happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore and he sees her body on the beach. He runs to get help or call the police and is seen by two young female swimmers who think that he is the escaping murderer.Police arrive and arrest Tisdall on the testimony of the two witnesses.

Robert claims innocence, but in the crowd that has gathered, none believe him.

Background: Pete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915-1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925-1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding father-son relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants and a former professional player-turned-coach. Context: Maravich was survived by his wife Jackie and his two sons Jaeson, who was 8 years old, and Josh, aged 5. Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in Seattle, Washington, and introduced him to Michael Jordan.  Since Maravich's children were very young when he died, Jackie Maravich initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father's funeral. However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait. During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told USA Today that, when he was still only a toddler, \\"My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I've been hooked ever since... . My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting. He said his dad told him he did the same thing.\\"  Despite some setbacks coping with their father's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketball--Josh at his father's alma mater, LSU.  On June 27, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Assembly Center which already bears the basketball star's name. Former coach Dale Brown opposes such a monument, but Maravich's widow, Jackie McLachlan, said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of her husband. McLachlan said that she has noticed how fans struggle to get the Maravich name on the Assembly Center into a camera frame.  In February 2016, the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a statue honoring Maravich be installed on the campus. Question: What do you find significant about Maravich's legacy?. Whats the answer?","output":"Answer: Pete Maravich's legacy is significant in a number of ways. Not only was he an accomplished basketball player himself, his passion and skills were also passed down to his sons Jaeson and Josh, who followed in their father's footsteps to play high school and collegiate basketball. Despite losing their father at a young age, the influence of their father’s love for the sport largely shaped their own talent and aspirations, demonstrating the lasting impact of Maravich's personal and professional life.  Also, Maravich makes a significant mark on history, as a symbol of talent and dedication in the sport of basketball. The proposal to erect a statue of him at the Louisiana State University (LSU) Assembly Center, a building that already bears his name, is a testament to his enduring impact on the sport and the institution. His widow's comment on fans struggling to fit the Maravich name into a camera frame illustrates the lasting admiration fans have for him.  The unanimous approval from the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame Committee for the statue further emphasizes the respect and significance of Maravich's legacy in the sport. The strong desire to commemorate him shows the lasting impression of his career, and his influence that extends beyond his personal achievements to impact future generations and the wider basketball community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Leonard Bernstein ( BURN-styne; August 25, 1918 - October 14, 1990) was an American composer, conductor, author, music lecturer, and pianist. He was among the first conductors born and educated in the US to receive worldwide acclaim. According to music critic Donal Henahan, he was \\"one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history.\\" Bernstein recorded extensively from the mid-1940s until just a few months before his death. Aside from those 1940s recordings, which were made for RCA Victor, Bernstein recorded primarily for Columbia Masterworks Records, especially when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic between 1958 and 1971. His typical pattern of recording at that time was to record major works in the studio immediately after they were presented in the orchestra's subscription concerts or on one of the Young People's Concerts, with any spare time used to record short orchestral showpieces and similar works. Many of these performances were digitally remastered and reissued by Sony as part of their 100 Volume, 125 CDs \\"Royal Edition\\" and their later \\"Bernstein Century\\" series. In 2010 many of these recordings were repackaged in a 60 CD \\"Bernstein Symphony Edition\\".  His later recordings (starting with Bizet's Carmen in 1972) were mostly made for Deutsche Grammophon, though he would occasionally return to the Columbia Masterworks label. Notable exceptions include recordings of Gustav Mahler's Song of the Earth and Mozart's 15th piano concerto and \\"Linz\\" symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for Decca Records (1966); Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy (1976) for EMI; and Wagner's Tristan und Isolde (1981) for Philips Records, a label that like Deutsche Grammophon was part of PolyGram at that time. Unlike his studio recordings for Columbia Masterworks, most of his later Deutsche Grammophon recordings were taken from live concerts (or edited together from several concerts with additional sessions to correct errors). Many replicate repertoire that he recorded in the 1950s and 60s.  In addition to his audio recordings, many of Bernstein's concerts from the 1970s onwards were recorded on motion picture film by the German film company Unitel. This included a complete cycle of the Mahler symphonies (with the Vienna Philharmonic and London Symphony Orchestra), as well as complete cycles of the Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann symphonies recorded at the same series of concerts as the audio recordings by Deutsche Grammophon. Many of these films appeared on Laserdisc and are now on DVD.  In total Bernstein was awarded 16 Grammys for his recordings in various categories, including several for posthumously released recordings. He was also awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 1985. What influences did he have?","output":"Leonard Bernstein was a very talented and successful musician. He was a composer, conductor, author, music lecturer, and pianist. People all around the world thought he was amazing! He made many recordings of his music, and some of them won special awards called Grammys. In 1985, he even got an extra-special Grammy for everything he had done in his life!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q:You are given a new situation: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  and a hint : Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  Please answer this question : Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots?

Aubrey Smith) and his wife Martha (Elisabeth Risdon); Tommy Mulvaney (Casey Johnson), the young son of a gangster, and his escort, gunman Pete (Allen Jenkins); Peggy Nolan (Lucille Ball), a woman with a shady past; and Vasquez (Joseph Calleia), an anarchist being extradited and facing a death sentence for killing a high-ranking politician, and his guard, Crimp (John Carradine), who expects a 5,000 (85,100 today) reward for delivering him. Pilot Bill (Chester Morris), co-pilot Joe Brooks (Kent Taylor), and steward Larry (Dick Hogan) comprise the crew.     Chester Morris, John Carradine, Lucille Ball and Joseph Calleia in Five Came Back On their way to Panama, a fierce nighttime storm buffets their airliner, The Silver Queen. A gas cylinder is shaken loose and knocks a door open; steward Larry attempts to close it, but falls to his death. An engine fails and the pilots are forced to crash-land in jungle terrain. In the morning the professor recognizes plants of the Amazon rainforest: the aircraft has been blown far south of where rescuers will search; the nearest civilization is across the mountains. But there is water, and enough fruit and game for everyone to live on. Weeks go by while Bill and Joe struggle to repair the damaged airliner, while the others clear a runway and lighten the aircraft by removing all unnecessary weight. The experience changes everyone. The Spenglers rediscover their love for each other. Bill warms to an appreciative Peggy, although she tells him about her sordid past. Judson falls apart, staying drunk much of the time, while Alice toughens up and begins to feel attracted to Joe. The biggest change is to Vasquez.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Review: This had all the makings of a very good film -- good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet) and lots of stock footage (if the Air Force had film of jets firing rockets, it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time-line. The movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit. At under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4,000 miles, it emits an exhaust of a million degrees, burning up everything on the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning (DEW) line bases and Eskimos. Every attempt at destroying the missile fails. The first flaws in this film appear early on. While we don't expect much from low-budget films, some things can't be forgotten -- like a little research. For instance, both the Soviets and the US fire anti-ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests weren't done until March of 1961 by the Russians. There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin. Parker's character cries and boo-hoos at Loggia's sacrifice like she was at a screen test. Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) hams it up so much he makes William Shatner look like a thespian. A bus driver continually spits out end-of-the-world crap in scene after scene. The only good actor is the film narrator, played by veteran character actor Lawrence Dobkins (\\"Naked City\\"). All of this could be overlooked if it wasn't for the time-line. After the missile's info is sent to DC, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists. A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes. After this, there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the Russians and if a response is necessary. The film shows the military being fully scrambled. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids (and we get to see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, though watching 50's sci-fi films made it seems like this was the standard). The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, a man at the Pentagon announces that the missile will hit Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile. He slowly produces a caseload of plutonium, loads it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile. Along the way, he is knocked off the road by a wild driver, breaks down and then is carjacked. He finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile. Again, all this in the same 63-minute time frame. The movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if Ottawa might be saved, only to show men, women and children get roasted. The missile is then said to have five minutes to reach New York. Loggia is still driving to the base (4 more miles to go). He gets to the base and arms the missile, a two-minute countdown is then announced. All within five minutes. The boroughs of New York should have been at least scorched. By the way, the missile is destroyed if you haven't guessed. The ABM warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear blast. Five seconds later, the blast dissipates and all is clear. Yeah, they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 Hiroshimas on the outskirts of New York City and nothing happens. The film had all the elements necessary to be a good B film, but wasted them. Loggia played his character so lamely you didn't care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You didn't care about the other characters, not even the smarmy scientist played by Pine. The tension that should have moved the film along just wasn't physically possible in the time-line allowed (it still wouldn't be today, not even with Jack Bauer). This film is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it hasn't been re-issued on any medium and for good reason. I don't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice, but there's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists, military men and businessmen into deep shelters, saying they're too valuable to lose. There isn't a single woman or minority in the bunch. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano. It was worse than \\"27 Days\\" where an alien gives five Earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn't include any blacks or Hispanics. I saw this on a special Sci-fi night on Turner Classic Movies and I don't expect it to show up again. If you do find a copy of this somewhere, you might want to put it up on Amazon.com.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What are the differences between a DC motor and an AC motor? Which motor has high starting torque AC or DC?","output":"While both questions are related to AC and DC motors, they do not have the same meaning. The first question is asking for the general differences between AC and DC motors; the second question is specifically asking which type of motor, AC or DC, has a higher starting torque. I will provide detailed answers to both questions below. Question 1: What are the differences between a DC motor and an AC motor? DC Motor: 1. Source of power: DC motors use a direct current (DC) power source, which means the electric current flows in a single, unchanging direction. 2. Construction: DC motors typically have a fixed armature (stator) and rotating magnetic field (rotor). They use carbon brushes and a commutator for transmitting electrical current, which can cause more wear and tear in the system due to friction. 3. Speed control: DC motors generally have a simpler and more precise speed control compared to AC motors. The speed is directly proportional to the applied voltage, making speed control more manageable. 4. Torque: DC motors can generate a higher starting torque compared to AC motors, which is useful when it comes to applications requiring an immediate load, such as electric vehicles and cranes. 5. Size and efficiency: DC motors are generally larger and less efficient compared to AC motors, mainly due to brush friction and energy losses in the commutation process. 6. Applications: DC motors are commonly used in applications where precise speed control, high starting torque, or variable speed is necessary, such as electric vehicles, cranes, and elevators. AC Motor: 1. Source of power: AC motors use an alternating current (AC) power source, which means the electric current repeatedly changes direction, typically in the form of a sine wave. 2. Construction: AC motors usually have a stationary magnetic field (stator) and a rotating armature (rotor). They do not require brushes or a commutator, leading to lower maintenance and longer life spans. 3. Speed control: AC motor speed control is generally more complex than that of DC motors, as it depends on the frequency of the AC current. Inverter technology has made it easier to control AC motor speeds. 4. Torque: AC motors typically have lower starting torque compared to DC motors but can produce a consistent and constant torque over a wide range of speeds, which is suited for many industrial applications. 5. Size and efficiency: AC motors are generally smaller, lighter, and more efficient compared to DC motors due to the absence of brushes and the commutation process. 6. Applications: AC motors are commonly used in various industrial and domestic applications, such as pumps, fans, air conditioners, refrigerators, and conveyor systems. Question 2: Which motor has high starting torque - AC or DC? As mentioned earlier, DC motors generally have a higher starting torque compared to AC motors. This characteristic makes DC motors suitable for applications requiring an immediate load, such as electric vehicles, cranes, and elevators. However, advancements in AC motor technology, such as variable frequency drives, have allowed for improvements in AC motor starting torque, making them competitive in applications that traditionally favored DC motors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years.

(Associated Press)      Penn State University officials say they \\"strongly dispute\\" an ex-student's claims that the school failed to investigate his hazing complaint against a fraternity.      The university says it offered \\"extraordinary assistance\\" over many months to now 21-year-old James Vivenzio before he filed suit Monday.      The school says neither Vivenzio nor his family were willing to file a formal complaint, provide documents, talk to campus police or engage in the formal disciplinary process. The school says it even sent an investigator to his Great Falls, Virginia, home last year.      The negligence lawsuit accuses Penn State of failing to address hazing, sexual intimidation, alcohol abuse and other problems at Kappa Delta Rho.      Vivenzio's lawyer says the hazing led his client to flunk his 2012-2013 freshman year.      ___      12:15 p.m.      A former student who blew the whistle on a Penn State fraternity's secret Facebook page featuring photos of naked women says the university ignored his complaints about sexual assault, hazing and drug use.      James Vivenzio, of Great Falls, Virginia, says in a lawsuit filed Monday against the university and the fraternity that he waited eight months for Penn State to take action before going to police in January.      Vivenzio says he was burned with cigarettes, force-fed buckets of liquor mixed with urine, vomit and hot sauce and made to guzzle alcohol as part of fraternity hazing rituals.      Vivenzio's lawyer says he went to police when he feared someone would die from the activities.      Penn State recently suspended the fraternity for three years. The university and fraternity didn't immediately return messages. ||||| James Vivenzio pledged a fraternity his freshman year at Penn State University, and in a lawsuit filed Monday, the Great Falls, Va., resident said he has physical and emotional scars to show for it.      Mr. Vivenzio, 21, is the former fraternity member of Kappa Delta Rho who alerted State College police to a private Facebook page that contained nude photos of drunk and unconscious female students, as well as males. The resulting investigation drew national attention in March and led Penn State to pull the fraternity’s recognition as a student group, effectively shutting it down.      With Monday’s complaint filed in Common Pleas Court in Philadelphia, Mr. Vivenzio and his attorney now have gone further, alleging in court a pattern of “reckless, barbaric and life threatening hazing” plus sexual assault, drug sales and other transgressions. The suit names as defendants Penn State and the fraternity and alleges the school did nothing for months — a claim Penn State sharply denied Monday, along with other accusations in the suit.      The lawsuit was filed on a day that the fraternity’s national headquarters in Greensburg said it had expelled 38 Kappa Delta Rho members from the organization, calling their actions inconsistent with its values. Executive director Joseph Rosenberg declined to discuss the lawsuit.      Penn State has declined to say whether any sanctions have been meted out so far against individuals and says it will not acknowledge if any such punishments are eventually imposed.      “The KDR fraternity operated much like a gang, obtaining some of its funding by converting the pre-paid food plans of its pledges and confiscating and selling their prescription drugs,’’ the 30-page complaint alleges. “These funds were then used to pay for countless socials, pre-socials and parties at the fraternity house at which underage students were plied with alcohol and, in some cases, with drugs to facilitate sexual assault and abuse.”      With Mr. Vivenzio and his parents, Robin and Jim Vivenzio, looking on during a news conference, attorney Aaron Freiwald described a culture of physical and psychological abuse of fraternity pledges and others.      State College police, who are conducting a criminal investigation, said the Facebook page had 144 active members including students and graduates. The page also contained derogatory comments.      “There was an image of a young woman who lost control of her bowels from liquor, passed out on a sofa,” Mr. Freiwald said.      The suit alleges that Mr. Vivenzio, who pledged as a freshman in 2012, was subjected to cigarette burns as well as “physically and mentally abusive late-night lineups that featured force-feeding of buckets-full of liquor mixed with urine, vomit, hot sauce and other liquid and semi-solid ingredients.”      The suit also alleges pledges were subjected to potential bodily injury in “gladiator” games.      Mr. Vivenzio pledged through hell week and became a member, but as a result of “extreme hazing” dropped out of Penn State after his freshman year, then entered rehabilitation and therapy programs for alcohol abuse, the lawsuit states. He was readmitted but later left and in early 2015 was hospitalized because of post-traumatic stress disorder after continued trauma, those representing him said.      Mr. Vivenzio said he did not seek to become a whistleblower but went to police after Penn State failed to adequately act over eight months.      “I’m hoping we can end hazing at Penn State and elsewhere,” said Mr. Vivenzio at the news conference.      “What really allowed these horrible things to take place was the attitude and the practice and the culture of this fraternity, of the national fraternity and the university,” Mr. Freiwald said.      Lisa Powers, a Penn State spokeswoman, said the school “strongly disputes” the allegations and took steps as soon as it was alerted by Mr. Vivenzio in April 2014. She said that at the time, neither Mr. Vivenzio nor his family would pursue the campus disciplinary process or talk with State College police, despite repeated encouragement from university staff.      “Our staff offered him extraordinary assistance on numerous occasions, and went to great lengths to do so over the course of nearly nine months — even sending the director of the Office of Student Conduct to their home to interview them,” she said.      Mr. Vivenzio, she added, did not inform them of the Facebook page. The school learned that from State College police in February, Ms. Powers said. The suit asserts Mr. Vivenzio did offer Penn State documentation.

James Vivenzio, 21, claims in his lawsuit that he was subjected to cigarette burns, late-night lineups that involved \\"force-feeding bucketfuls of liquor mixed with urine, vomit, hot sauce and other liquid and semi-solid ingredients,\\" \\"gladiator\\" games risking bodily injuries and drinking hard liquor non-stop until it induced vomiting.      The lawsuit claims the abuse took place despite public assurances by the school and fraternity of \\"zero tolerance\\" toward hazing.      Vivenzio claims he was victimized by hazing throughout the 2012-2013 school year. He alleges he went to Penn State officials with evidence of the Facebook postings and the abuse in April 2014, but that nothing was done.      Vivenzio says that in January he brought the information to State College police. Only then did Penn State begin the investigation that resulted in the fraternity's three-year suspension, he says.      Penn State issued a statement rebuking Vivenzio's claims. The university said Vivenzio did approach school officials in 2014, but that \\"neither he nor his family were willing to file a complaint, provide documentation, speak with State College Police or participate in pursuing the formal disciplinary process available to them, despite repeated encouragement from University staff.\\"      The statement also said Vivenzio never mentioned the private Facebook page. The school only learned of it from police in 2015, the statement said.      Last month, Penn State kicked Kappa Delta Rho off campus for three years. The university's report on its investigation concluded that activities of some KDR members \\"included photographing individuals in extremely compromising positions and posting these photos to a private Facebook site accessible to the group's members.\\"      A letter from Damon Sims, vice president for Student Affairs, to the university's Intrafraternity Council also cited physical and emotional abuse of pledges, along with drug sales and use. Among other duties, KDR pledges were required to create stories with pornographic images and a \\"sex position of the day.\\"      Sims also cited the \\"persistent harassment of two female students, who were degraded through multiple postings to the organization's private site over an extended period.\\"      Sims said that that while not every member of the fraternity was equally culpable, \\"the sum of the organizational misbehaviors is far more than the University can tolerate from a student organization...\\"      Joe Rosenberg, the national fraternity's executive director, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. On Monday, the fraternity announced that it had expelled 38 members from its Penn State chapter and also suspended it for three years.      \\"It's unfortunate that it had to come to this,\\" Rosenberg told USA TODAY. \\"But we hold our brothers accountable for their actions.\\"      The fraternity also issued a statement expressing gratitude to Penn State chapter members who \\"assumed responsibility after the regrettable events of the last few months.\\" Those members, the statement said, were not tossed out.      \\"We look forward to our efforts to rejoin the Penn State community after this three year period has expired,\\" the statement said.

(AP) — Nearly 40 members have been expelled from a Penn State fraternity that's been suspended for three years over a Facebook page featuring photos of nude and semi-nude women.      The national office of Kappa Delta Rho says Monday the 38 members violated the fraternity's values. Other members will be moved to alumni status.      Kappa Delta Rho executive director Joseph Rosenberg said in a statement that fraternity members who assumed responsibility for their actions wouldn't be expelled. He says chapter President Tom Friel exhibited outstanding leadership traits.      The actions have no effect on their status at the school.      Penn State says its investigation found some fraternity members engaged in sexual harassment and hazing that included a \\"persistent climate of humiliation\\" for women.

Step 2: Diagnosing the Problem The next step is to determine the cause of data loss. This could be due to hardware failure, accidental deletion, corruption, or other factors. Identifying the issue at hand helps in selecting the appropriate recovery method. Step 3: Identifying the Viable Drives Examine the RAID drives and determine which ones are still functional. If one or more drives are damaged beyond recovery, note this to avoid complications later in the recovery process. Step 4: Making a Backup or Clone To safeguard against any further data loss or damage, it is prudent to create a clone or backup of the data present on the remaining functional drives. This step is crucial before attempting to recover data. Step 5: Finding a Recovery Tool or Service In order to recover data from RAID hard drives, it is necessary to either use data recovery software specifically designed for RAID arrays or enlist the help of a professional data recovery service. Depending on the complexity of the RAID setup and the cause of data loss, the choice may vary. Step 6: Reconstructing the RAID Array (If Using Software) If using data recovery software, the next step is to reconstruct the original RAID configuration using the functional drives. This process may require the user to input RAID parameters such as stripe size, parity rotation, and disk order, which were used in the original RAID setup. Step 7: Scanning the RAID Array for Lost Data Once the RAID array has been reconstructed, the software or service will scan the drives to locate and recover lost data. Depending on the size and complexity of the RAID system, this step may take some time. Step 8: Previewing and Recovering Data After the scanning process is complete, the user will typically be presented with a list of files and directories that the software or service has identified as recoverable. Carefully review the list and select the desired files and directories for recovery. Step 9: Saving Recovered Data to a Safe Location To prevent any further complications, save the recovered data to a separate storage device or location. Double-check the files and directories to ensure that the data has been recovered successfully. Step 10: Rebuilding the RAID Array (Optional) If necessary, the RAID array can be rebuilt on new hardware or with a functional set of drives, taking care to use the same RAID configuration as before to ensure proper operation. Make sure to transfer the recovered data back onto the RAID array after rebuilding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: Official figures showed inflation rose to 1.6%, a level that may usher in higher interest rates. That boosted sterling and Mrs May's speech spurred on that rally. Its best move was against the dollar, against which it closed in London trade up almost 3% at 1.2392. Dealers said that rise, which was the best for the pound since October 2008, had been helped by a weakening dollar. Nevertheless the pound gained strongly against all major tradeable currencies, including notching up a 1.8% rise against the euro to reach 1.157 euros. According to Thomson Reuters data, the pound had its best day's gain against a basket of major currencies since 1998. The pound has been hammered by dealers since the Brexit vote in June last year and remains 16% below its level of 1.47 the day before the referendum. Also on Tuesday, the benchmark FTSE 100 share index, which was already in negative territory for the day, fell further to stand 1.46% lower at 7220.38. In her speech, Mrs May said the UK would leave the EU's single market, but stressed that it would seek new international trade opportunities and be open to global trade. The pound had already made gains in early trading on Tuesday, but surged as a result of the prime minister's speech. \\"News that the Brexit deal will be put to a Parliamentary vote has seen sterling rocket, as have assurances from [Mrs] May of Britain's global intentions,\\" said Dennis de Jong, managing director at online foreign exchange broker UFX.com. \\"While the announcement that Britain will leave the single market isn't what traders wanted to hear, it doesn't come as a shock. \\"With markets bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario, the better-than-expected news in [Mrs] May's speech should help to buoy the beleaguered currency - at least for the time being.\\" Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the last time the pound was up so sharply against the dollar, it was also a \\"turbulent\\" time for the currency. \\"If you look at both periods - October 2008 during the financial crisis, and today - there's a lot of volatility in the currency markets,\\" he said. The pound rose more sharply against the dollar than it did against the euro because the US currency had been weakened by remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump in the Wall Street Journal.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Lee Jones is a professional rugby union player, born as Lee Jones on June 28, 1988 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jones is known for his competency in playing the challenging wing position. His rugby career helped him develop a sturdy physique, with his weight reaching 86 kilograms and height standing at 1.80 meters. Jones' early education took place at Selkirk High School, followed by his enrollment at Heriot-Watt University. His first interaction with rugby was through the amateur club, Selkirk RFC, which provided him the necessary skills and experience to later transition into professional rugby union. His professional rugby career began with Edinburgh in 2010 and continued till 2014. During this period, Jones played in 57 matches, showcasing his prowess as a player by scoring a total of 45 points. Subsequently, in 2014, Jones moved to the Glasgow Warriors, a transition that lasted for a brief period of time. However, this move was significant in his career, as he managed to score 5 points in 6 matches, and later returned to play for the Glasgow Warriors again. Simultaneously, Jones represented Scotland on the international stage. In 2008, he was part of the Scotland U20, then advanced to Scotland A in 2011, and reached the Scotland national team in 2012. He played a total of 15 matches, scoring 5 points, which reflects his consistent performances as a team player. His last update for the national team was on November 12, 2012.

He appeared in 5 competitions and scored a commendable 50 points in one and an outstanding 125 points in another. As of the last club update on May 14, 2014, Jones had made significant contributions to both his club and national teams. Despite the nitty-gritty of numbers that form part of his career, what remains undeniable is Jones' prowess in rugby union, his dedication to the sport, and his contribution to Scottish rugby. Remarkably, within a span of a few years, he has transitioned from being an amateur to becoming one of Scotland's notable rugby union players."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hakea gibbosa, commonly known as hairy hakea or rock hakea, is a shrub of the family Proteaceae native to southeastern Australia. It has become an environmental weed in South Africa and New Zealand, where it had been introduced for use as a hedge plant. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Many people in Australia enjoy having Hakea gibbosa as a hedge plant.","output":"While the original paragraph does not explicitly state that many people in Australia enjoy having Hakea gibbosa as a hedge plant, the information provided does suggest that this could be a possibility. Given that the Hakea gibbosa plant is native to southeastern Australia and has been introduced as a hedge plant in other countries such as South Africa and New Zealand, it could be inferred that this shrub might have similar uses and appreciation in its native country, Australia.  One of the factors supporting this assumption is that the Hakea gibbosa has certain qualities that would make it suitable for use as a hedge plant. Firstly, the plant is a shrub, which means it has a bushy growth habit, making it an ideal candidate for landscaping purposes, including hedges. Secondly, the plant belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is known to include many species that are widely grown in Australia for their ornamental features such as colorful flowers and interesting foliage. Additionally, the fact that the plant is native to Australia would make it adapted to the local climatic conditions, which is another desirable feature when considering plants for landscaping purposes. It is also worth mentioning that the paragraph describes Hakea gibbosa as an environmental weed in South Africa and New Zealand, which means that the plant has the ability to spread rapidly and outcompete other native plants. This could suggest that the Hakea gibbosa might have vigorous growth characteristics, which can be an attractive feature in a hedge plant. The rapid growth of the plant might offer quick coverage and privacy, which are some of the common reasons people choose to have hedge plants in their gardens. In conclusion, while the original paragraph does not directly state that many people in Australia enjoy having Hakea gibbosa as a hedge plant, the information provided about its native distribution, the fact that it has been introduced as a hedge plant in other countries, and the characteristics of the plant do support the possibility. However, to definitively confirm this claim, more information about the specific horticultural preferences and trends in Australia would be required."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"The Holocaust (which roughly means \\"burnt whole\\") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other \\"unwanted\\" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany.\\" the correct answer?","output":"While the answer you provided defines the Holocaust, it does not address how the Nazis were able to conjure up anti-Semitic feelings in civilians. To understand this, we must delve into the historical background, Nazi propaganda, and manipulation tactics employed by the Nazi regime to incite anti-Semitism among the general population. 1. Pre-existing anti-Semitism: Before the Nazis rose to power, anti-Semitism was already present in Europe. The Jews were often scapegoated for various issues, such as economic crises, political instability, and social corruption. The Nazis were able to use this pre-existing prejudice as a foundation upon which to build their genocidal program. 2. Propaganda: Once Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power, they launched a massive propaganda campaign that portrayed Jews as racially inferior, morally corrupt, and responsible for Germany's problems. Newspapers like \\"Der Stürmer\\" and films like \\"The Eternal Jew\\" were used to spread lies about Jews through hateful and grotesque caricatures. Such propaganda helped to dehumanize Jews, making it easier for the general population to accept discrimination, persecution, and ultimately extermination. 3. Ideology of racial purity: The Nazis promoted their idea of the Aryan race, which they considered superior and destined to rule over the world. They identified Jews as one of the primary enemies of the Aryan race, along with Romani people, Slavs, and people with disabilities. The Nazis pushed for racial purification, which involved eliminating those they considered \\"racially inferior,\\" thus encouraging anti-Semitic beliefs among Nazis and their sympathizers. 4. Economic motivation: The Nazis often seized Jewish businesses, homes, and other assets, redistributing them to non-Jewish Germans. This method gave some Germans an economic incentive to support the Nazi regime and its anti-Semitic policies. 5. Manipulation of religious beliefs: The Nazis twisted Christian beliefs, associating Jews with the idea of evil. They exploited the historical Christian accusation of Jews being responsible for Jesus Christ's crucifixion and used this religious narrative to justify their persecution of Jews. They also infiltrated and controlled churches, replacing some religious symbols and teachings with Nazi ideology. 6. Stereotyping and collective blame: The Nazis perpetuated stereotypes of Jews as greedy and manipulative, reinforcing the negative image already present in some parts of society. They also held Jews collectively responsible for the acts of individual Jews, further promoting anti-Semitic feelings. 7. Education and indoctrination: The Nazis controlled the education system and shaped it to promote their racial ideals. They introduced anti-Semitic literature and lessons, aiming to indoctrinate young Germans against Jews from an early age. 8. Political manipulation: The Nazis scapegoated Jews for Germany's economic hardships, especially the loss of territory, inflation, and unemployment caused by the Treaty of Versailles, which marked the end of World War I. This strategy allowed the Nazis to deflect criticism away from their own actions and policies and focus people's anger and resentment on an external \\"enemy.\\" Through the combination of these tactics and exploiting pre-existing prejudices, the Nazis were able to conjure up anti-Semitic feelings in civilians, leading to widespread acceptance or toleration of the destructive policies that ultimately culminated in the Holocaust."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose paintings attracted a favourable review in the press for the first time at the 1817 Summer Exhibition?  Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that \\"I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy\\" and complaining of \\"the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth\\" which he considered \\"such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it\\". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his... Answer:","output":"Etty"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The sequence follows the rule where the teacher skips an increasing number of children each time. 1. **Sequence of Candy Distribution**:    The first child to receive a candy is at position ( 1 ). The ( k )-th child to receive a candy is at position:    [    frac{k(k+1)}{2} mod n    ]    This is because the teacher skips ( k ) children after giving a candy to the ( k )-th child. 2. **Odd Prime Divider**:    Suppose ( n ) has an odd prime divisor ( p ). We need to show that not all children will receive a candy in this case. Consider the sequence modulo ( p ):    [    forall a in mathbb{N}, exists b in mathbb{N} text{ such that } frac{b(b+1)}{2} equiv a mod p    ]    This implies that every number ( a ) modulo ( p ) can be represented as ( frac{b(b+1)}{2} mod p ). However, for any ( r in mathbb{N} ):    [    frac{r(r+1)}{2} equiv frac{(r+p)(r+p+1)}{2} mod p    ]    This means the sequence repeats every ( p ) steps. Since ( p ) is an odd prime, not all residues modulo ( p ) will be covered, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( n ) cannot have an odd prime divisor. 3. **Power of 2**:    Now, consider ( n = 2^k ) where ( k in mathbb{Z}, k geq 0 ). We need to show that in this case, all children will eventually receive a candy. Assume there exist ( a > b ) such that:    [    frac{a(a+1)}{2} equiv frac{b(b+1)}{2} mod 2^k    ]    This implies:    [    (a-b)(a+b+1) equiv 0 mod 2^k    ]    Since ( 0 < (a-b) < 2^k ) and ( 0 < (a+b+1) < 2^k ), neither ( (a-b) ) nor ( (a+b+1) ) can be divisible by ( 2^k ). This leads to a contradiction, implying that all values ( frac{a(a+1)}{2} mod 2^k ) are distinct for ( a in [0, 2^k-1] ).    Therefore, after ( 2^k ) rounds, all children will have received at least one candy.

Since ( d mid (4n + 5) ) and ( d mid (7n + 6) ), it follows that ( d ) also divides their difference:    [    d mid (7n + 6) - (4n + 5) = 3n + 1.    ]     3. Next, using the fact that ( d mid (3n + 1) ) and returning to our original expressions, we consider:    [    d mid (4n + 5) - (3n + 1) = n + 4.    ] 4. Similarly, from ( d mid (3n + 1) ) and the derived expression ( d mid (n + 4) ), we have another relationship:    [    d mid (3n + 1) - 2(n + 4) = 3n + 1 - 2n - 8 = n - 7.    ] 5.

This bisector will be the line ( AI ), where ( I ) is the incenter of ( triangle ABC ).      Similarly, ( O_2 ) lies on the angle bisector ( BI ), and ( O_3 ) on ( CI ). 3. **Parallel Lines and Similar Triangles**:      Since ( odot O_1 ) and ( odot O_2 ) intersect ( AB ) and have equal radii, the perpendicular distances from ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) to ( AB ) are equal. Hence, ( O_1O_2 parallel AB ).      Analogously, ( O_2O_3 parallel BC ) and ( O_3O_1 parallel CA ). 4. **Similar Triangles**:      Given the parallelisms, triangles ( triangle O_1O_2O_3 ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar, with ( I ) being the center of similarity (homothety center) that maps ( triangle O_1O_2O_3 ) to ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Equal Distances to the Common Point**:      Since ( K ) is the common intersection point of the three circles, by definition, ( KO_1 = KO_2 = KO_3 ). Therefore, ( K ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle O_1O_2O_3 ). 6. **Relation to Triangle Circumcenter**:      The circumcenter of ( triangle O_1O_2O_3 ) is ( K ), while the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ) is ( O ). Because of the nature of similar triangles and their circumcenters, the line passing through the incenter ( I ) of ( triangle ABC ) is the same line that passes through ( O ) and ( K ). 7. **Conclusion**:      Thus, the incenter ( I ) of ( triangle ABC ), the circumcenter ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ), and the common point ( K ) of the three circles are collinear.

The units digit of ( p^3 ) minus the units digit of ( p^2 ) is equal to 0. This means that the units digit of ( p^3 ) and ( p^2 ) must be the same. The units digit of a number raised to a power depends only on the units digit of the base number. The units digits that remain the same when squared and cubed are 0, 1, 5, and 6. Since p is a positive even integer, the only possible units digit for p is 6. 2. The sum of the digits of p is divisible by q. We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of p or q, but we know that the sum of the digits of p must be a multiple of q. 3. ( p^x = q ) for some positive integer x. Since p is a base and q is a power of p, q must be a multiple of p. Now, we are asked to find the units digit of ( p + 2 ).

So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 60 km/h - 40 km/h = 20 km/h To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s: 20 km/h * (5/18) = (20 * 5) / 18 = 100 / 18 ≈ 5.56 m/s Now, let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, the total distance they need to cover to cross each other is 2L meters. We know that they take 55 seconds to cross each other, so we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time 2L = 5.56 m/s * 55 s 2L = 305.8 meters Now, we can find the length of each train: L = 305.8 meters / 2 L = 152.9 meters When the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 km/h + 40 km/h = 100 km/h Again, converting this speed into meters per second: 100 km/h * (5/18) = (100 * 5) / 18 = 500 / 18 ≈ 27.78 m/s Now, we want to find the time it takes for the trains to cross each other when running in opposite directions.

We are given a virtual state with cities connected by roads, and from each city, there is a way to get to any other city using these roads. The state is defined as \\"simple\\" or \\"complex\\" based on whether you can start from a city, travel along the roads without passing the same road twice, and return to the original city.  Petya and Vasya are playing a game where: - Petya sets the directions on each road. - After each move of Petya (moving a tourist according to the road directions), Vasya changes the direction of one road entering or exiting the current city. - Vasya wins if at any point Petya cannot make a move. We are required to prove: 1. In a simple state, Petya can always play in such a way that he will not lose regardless of how Vasya plays. 2. In a complex state, Vasya can guarantee his own victory regardless of how Petya plays. Let's proceed step by step.  Part (a) In a simple state, the graph forms a tree. 1. Petya selects an arbitrary vertex as the root. 2. Petya directs all edges towards the root city. For any city (v), there is exactly one path to the root. Let's denote this path as (P_v). 1. Petya places the tourist in the root. 2. Since all paths and their respective orientations are directed towards the root, any movement by the tourist must be towards the root. 3. Each time Vasya changes the direction of an edge, it only affects the path (P_v) without isolating the root. Vasya can only reverse the edge into or out of the current tourist's city. No matter how Vasya changes the direction of one edge: - The tourist can always move towards the root (since there exists a directed path from any city to the root). - Petya never loses, as there is always a permissible move for him. Conclusion: [ boxed{text{In a simple state, Petya can always avoid losing.}} ]  Part (b) In a complex state, the graph contains at least one cycle.     Let's prove that Vasya can always ensure a victory, using induction on the number of vertices (n). **Base Case:** For (n = 3) (a simple cycle (A_1 A_2 A_3 A_1)), irrespective of the initial orientation: - Petya will move the tourist along one edge. - Vasya, knowing the tourist's current position, flips the next edge that would lead back to a previous city. Thus, (boxed{text{Vasya wins}} ). **Inductive Step:** Assume for a graph (G) with (k) vertices ((k > 3)), Vasya can guarantee a win. Now consider a new graph (G') with (k+1) vertices where (G') is a subgraph of (G) containing an additional vertex (V). 1. Identify a minimal cycle (S) in (G) — it will be simple and cannot have interior edges. 2. It must contain the vertex (V), as we can always assume the smallest cycle can be extrapolated by adding (V).  We use Vasya's winning strategy in (G'). Consider any initial orientation:    - Suppose the tourist enters (G). Vasya ensures the tourist will repeatedly come back to enter (G) due to possible reorientation.     - When the tourist leaves (S), ensuring Petya does not always manage clear directional permutations unless reverting into (S). By the minimal cycle method and reorientation:    - After (k+1) iterations as required, Petya always runs out of moves to adjust ensuring loss within (G').

Since when 0 < x < 1, g'(x) < 0, g(x) is monotonically decreasing; when 1 < x < +infty, g'(x) > 0, g(x) is monotonically increasing, thus at x=1, g(x) has a minimum value of 1. Therefore, when x > 1, g(x) > g(1)=1, which implies x-ln x > 1, or equivalently x > ln x+1 > ln x. Hence, (1+ frac {1}{n}) > ln (1+ frac {1}{n}) always holds. Therefore, f(2x)+f(2)geqslant 2f'(x), and the inequality is proven. (Ⅲ) For minmathbb{N} and m > 1, we have (1+ frac {1}{m})^{m}= C_{m}^{0}+ C_{m}^{1}(frac {1}{m})+ C_{m}^{2}(frac {1}{m})^{2}+cdots + C_{m}^{k}(frac {1}{m})^{k}+cdots + C_{m}^{m}(frac {1}{m})^{m} = 1+1+ frac {m(m-1)}{2!}(frac {1}{m})^{2}+cdots + frac {m(m-1)cdots (m-k+1)}{k!}(frac {1}{m})^{k}+cdots + frac {m(m-1)cdots 2cdot 1}{m!}(frac {1}{m})^{m} = 2+ frac {1}{2!}(1- frac {1}{m})+cdots + frac {1}{k!}(1- frac {1}{m})(1- frac {2}{m})cdots (1- frac {k-1}{m})+cdots + frac {1}{m!}(1- frac {1}{m})cdots (1- frac {m-1}{m}) < 2+ frac {1}{2!}+cdots + frac {1}{k!}+cdots + frac {1}{m!} < 2+(1- frac {1}{2})+( frac {1}{2}- frac {1}{3})+cdots +( frac {1}{k-1}- frac {1}{k})+cdots +( frac {1}{m-1}- frac {1}{m}) =3- frac {1}{m} < 3; and since C_{m}^{k}(frac {1}{m})^{k} > 0 for k=2,3,…,m, it follows that 2 < (1+ frac {1}{m})^{m} < 3. Since 2 < (1+ frac {1}{m})^{m} < 3, it follows that 2n < sum_{k=1}^{n}(1+ frac {1}{k})^{k} < 3n holds, which means there exists a=2 such that 2n < sum_{k=1}^{n}(1+ frac {1}{k})^{k} < 3n always holds.

First, let's consider the smallest value of ( n ) which is ( n = 1 ): 1. Here, we only have two numbers: ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). 2. The sum ( 1 + 2 = 3 ) is not a perfect square. So ( n = 1 ) does not satisfy the condition. Now, let us assume ( n > 1 ).  Method 1: For any ( n > 1 ), we can partition the numbers into groups of four consecutive numbers and, if necessary, groups of six consecutive numbers. 1. **Groups of Four Consecutive Numbers:**     - Consider a set of four consecutive numbers: ( a, a+1, a+2, a+3 ).     - Pair them as ( (a, a+3) ) and ( (a+1, a+2) ).     - Sum of the pairs: ( a + (a+3) = 2a + 3 ) and ( (a+1) + (a+2) = 2a + 3 ).     - Multiplying these sums together gives ( (2a + 3)^2 ), which is a perfect square. 2. **Groups of Six Consecutive Numbers:**     - To balance any remaining numbers after forming groups of four, consider six consecutive numbers: ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ).     - We can pair them as ( (1, 6) ), ( (2, 5) ), and ( (3, 4) ).     - Sum of pairs: ( 1 + 6 = 7 ), ( 2 + 5 = 7 ), ( 3 + 4 = 7 ).     - Multiplying these sums together gives ( 7^3 = 343 ), which is not suitable. Instead, we could use the pairings differently to make compatible sums that could produce squares like in our initial example. By this method, for any ( n > 1 ), we can group and pair into sums that their product will form a perfect square.  Method 2: Let us further generalize this for both even and odd ( n ). 1. **Even ( n ):**     - Pair the outermost numbers in sequence, ( (1, 2n), (2, 2n-1), ldots, (n, n+1) ).     - The sums of these pairs: ( 1 + 2n, 2 + (2n-1), ldots, n + (n+1) ) each equals ( 2n+1 ).     - Number of such pairs: ( n ).     - Multiplying these sums gives ( (2n+1)^n ), which is indeed a perfect square. 2. **Odd ( n ):**     - Initially pair first six numbers to get ( (1+6), (2+5), (3+4) ), giving sums of ( 7 ).     - Remaining numbers make up pairs like even case up to the sequence.     - The pairings and sums from the remaining follow the form ( 2n+7 ).     - The resulting product shapes up in a way to form ((2n+7)^{n-3}) as per pattern similarly leading to squared outcomes.

The rate at which the road is being built with the initial number of men (M) can be calculated as follows: Rate with M men = Distance completed / Time taken Rate with M men = 2.5 km / 100 days The remaining work to be done is: Remaining work = Total length of the road - Length of the road completed Remaining work = 15 km - 2.5 km Remaining work = 12.5 km The new rate required to complete the remaining work in time can be calculated as: New rate = Remaining work / Remaining time New rate = 12.5 km / 200 days The engineer decides to employ 60 extra men to meet this new rate. Let's denote the new total number of men as M + 60. We can assume that the work done is directly proportional to the number of men and the time they work.

Notez-le fait que pour chaque x, il existe un y différent tel que xy = 1. Par conséquent, nous devons voir comment ces fonctions réagissent. Écrivons quelques valeurs connus:    [    f(1) = -1, quad fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = -f(2), quad f(0) = 1.    ]    Puisque prendre des valeurs spécifiques ne semble pas directement nous aider à déterminer fleft(frac{42}{17}right), cherchons une structure plus générale. 6.

Thus, we have: - Omega = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For the events: - Event A (\\"the number is 1\\") can be represented as A = {1}. - Event B (\\"the number is even\\") includes all even numbers from the sample space, thus B = {2, 4, 6}. - Event C (\\"the number is less than 3\\") includes numbers less than 3, so C = {1, 2}. - Event D (\\"the number is greater than 2\\") includes numbers greater than 2, giving D = {3, 4, 5, 6}. - Event E (\\"the number is a multiple of 3\\") includes numbers that are multiples of 3 from the sample space, which are E = {3, 6}. **Step 2: Analyzing the relationships between the events** For the relationships between events: - A subset C because the set for A ({1}) is entirely contained within the set for C ({1, 2}). - C cup D = Omega because the union of sets C and D covers the entire sample space Omega. This is because C includes numbers less than 3, and D includes numbers greater than 2, together covering all possibilities in Omega. - E subset D indicates that the set for E ({3, 6}) is entirely contained within the set for D ({3, 4, 5, 6}). **Step 3: Representing the events in set notation** For the given operations on events: - overline{D} = {1, 2}, since overline{D} represents the complement of D, which includes all elements not in D. Since D = {3, 4, 5, 6}, the complement is the numbers 1 and 2. - overline{A}C = {2}, this is found by taking the intersection of the complement of A (which is all numbers except 1) with C (which includes 1 and 2). The only number that fits this criteria is 2. - overline{B} cup C = {1, 2, 3}, where overline{B} includes all numbers that are not even ({1, 3, 5}), and its union with C (which is {1, 2}) results in {1, 2, 3}. - overline{D} + overline{E} = {1, 2, 4, 5}, which represents the union (denoted here by + for clarity) of the complements of D and E.

We know that the total number of birds in the tree after more birds flew up is 42. Given that 40% of the birds are larger, we can calculate L as follows: L = 40% of 42 L = 0.40 * 42 L = 16.8 Since the number of birds must be a whole number, we round L to the nearest whole number. However, since we know that the number of larger birds cannot be a fraction, we must consider that the actual percentage might be slightly different to accommodate whole numbers. Let's assume L is 17 for now and adjust if necessary. Given that 60% of the birds are smaller, we can calculate S as follows: S = 60% of 42 S = 0.60 * 42 S = 25.2 Similarly, since the number of birds must be a whole number, we round S to the nearest whole number. Let's assume S is 25 for now and adjust if necessary. Now, let's check if L + S equals the total number of birds (42): L + S = 17 + 25 L + S = 42 The numbers add up correctly, so we have 17 larger birds and 25 smaller birds after more birds flew up.

Then, we seek a and b such that:    [    frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{pq}.    ]    Since a and b must be strictly greater than pq, set:    [    a = pq + c quad text{and} quad b = pq + d    ]    where c and d are positive integers. 2. **Combine and simplify**:    Substitute a and b in the equation:    [    frac{1}{pq+c} + frac{1}{pq+d} = frac{1}{pq}.    ]    Combine the fractions on the left-hand side:    [    frac{pq + d + pq + c}{(pq+c)(pq+d)} = frac{2pq + c + d}{(pq+c)(pq+d)}.    ]    Equate this to frac{1}{pq} and cross-multiply:    [    pq(pq+c)(pq+d) = pq(2pq + c + d).    ]    Simplify to get:    [    (pq+c)(pq+d) = 2p^2q^2 + pq(c + d).    ]     3. **Conclude the product**:    Notice that if we expand (pq+c)(pq+d):    [    p^2q^2 + pqc + pqd + cd = 2p^2q^2 + pq(c + d).    ]    Arrange terms:    [    cd = p^2q^2.    ] 4. **Find the solutions**:    The equality cd = p^2 q^2 implies that both c and d are divisors of p^2 q^2. Since c < d, c must be one of the divisors less than pq. The divisors of p^2 q^2 are 1, p, p^2, q, pq, pq^2, q^2, p^2 q, p^2 q^2. Ignoring pq (since c neq d), the number of valid pairs (c, d) is 4. 5. **Count the unique decompositions**:    Since each pair (c, d) directly determines a unique pair (a, b) where a < b, and the pairs (a, b) are considered distinct from (b, a), we conclude each combination corresponds to one way of decomposing frac{1}{pq}. The four valid pairs, if considered distinct in both orders, result in 4 times 2 = 8 decompositions.     If the order does not matter, there are 4 unique decompositions because each distinct (c, d) pair counts once. # Conclusion: If we count the pairs (a, b) differently than (b, a), there are: [ boxed{8} ] If we count the pairs (a, b) and (b, a) as the same, there are: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"instruction":"Maria is five years older than Anna.

Since PQ has endpoints (a, b) and (3-b, 3-a), its slope is  m_{PQ} = frac{(3-a)-b}{(3-b)-a} = frac{3-a-b}{3-b-a} = -1 Therefore, the slope of line l is  m_l = -frac{1}{m_{PQ}} = 1 With slope 1 and passing through point M, the equation of line l is given by the point-slope form y-y_1 = m(x-x_1), which simplifies to  y - frac{a-b+3}{2} = 1 left( x - frac{a-b+3}{2} right) This equation simplifies to  y - frac{a-b+3}{2} = x - frac{a-b+3}{2} And by rearranging terms, we get the equation of line l:  x + y - 3 = 0 The center (2,3) of circle C is symmetric with respect to line l.

In this case, we can rewrite the given equation as x^{2}=frac{1}{a}y by dividing both sides by a and rearranging. 2. **Understand the relationship between a and the directrix**: The directrix of a parabola in the form x^{2}=4py is y=-p. Given that the directrix is y=1, we can infer that -p=1, which implies p=-1. Since p is negative, this confirms that a < 0 because the parabola opens downwards. 3. **Find the value of a**: The standard form x^{2}=4py can be compared to our rewritten equation x^{2}=frac{1}{a}y. Thus, 4p=frac{1}{a}. Knowing that p=-1, we substitute p into the equation to get 4(-1)=frac{1}{a}, which simplifies to -frac{1}{4}=frac{1}{a}. Solving for a, we find a=-frac{1}{4}.

In this case, we can use properties of primitive roots modulo ( p ). 4. **Construction for ( n+1 ) being prime:**    - Let ( n+1 = p ) where ( p ) is a prime number.    - Let ( g ) be a primitive root modulo ( p ). Define the bijection ( f ) by ( f(x) = g^x pmod{p} ).    - We need to check if ( (p) mid f(x)^m - f(y) ) for all ( x, y ) such that ( n mid mx - y ). 5. **Verification:**    - Since ( g ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ), ( g ) generates all non-zero residues modulo ( p ).    - For ( x, y ) such that ( n mid mx - y ), we have ( y equiv mx pmod{n} ).    - Therefore, ( f(y) = g^y equiv g^{mx} pmod{p} ).    - We need to show ( p mid g^{mxm} - g^{my} ). Since ( y equiv mx pmod{n} ), we have ( g^{my} equiv g^{m(mx)} equiv (g^m)^{mx} pmod{p} ).    - Thus, ( g^{mxm} equiv g^{my} pmod{p} ), and the condition holds. 6. **Proof for ( n+1 ) not being prime:**    - Assume ( n+1 ) is not prime. Then ( n+1 ) can be written as a product of distinct primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ).    - We will show that this leads to a contradiction. 7. **Contradiction:**    - Consider an element ( q in [n] ) such that ( p_1 p_2 ldots p_{k-1} mid q ) but ( q equiv 1 pmod{p_k} ).    - There exists ( a in [n] ) such that ( a^m equiv q pmod{n+1} ).    - By the lemma, there are ( gcd(m, n) ) such ( a ).    - Similarly, there are ( gcd(m, n) ) elements ( y in [n] ) such that ( y^m equiv 1 pmod{n+1} ).    - Since ( m ) is even, there are more such ( y ) than such ( x ), leading to a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion:**    - The only possible values for ( n ) are those for which ( n+1 ) is a prime number.

Next:     - ( x = 250 )     - (250 equiv 2 pmod{8})     - So (x = 250), then (x-1 = 249), which is not divisible by 8. 4. Next:     - ( x = 375 ):     - (375 equiv 7 pmod{8})     - So ( x = 375 ), then (x-1 = 374), which is not divisible by 8. 5. Next:     - ( x = 500 )     - (500 equiv 4 pmod{8})     - So if ( x = 500 ), ( x-1 = 499), which is not divisible by 8. 6. Next:     - ( x = 625 )     - (625 equiv 1 pmod{8})     - So if (  x = 625 ), ( x-1 = 624), which is not divisible by 8. 7. Next:     - ( x = 750 )     - (750 equiv 6 pmod{8})     - So if (  x = 750 ), ( x-1 = 749), which is not divisible by 8. 8. Finally:     - ( x = 875 )     - (875 equiv 3 pmod{8})     - So if ( x = 875 ), ( x -1 = 874 ), which is not divisible by 8. # Checking multiples of 8 Next, let's check the values of x that are multiples of 8: 1. (x = 376) since ( x-1=375) is divisible by 125: - (376 equiv 0 pmod 8) - (376^2 equiv 376 pmod{1000}) Therefore, the smallest x that satisfies the condition is: [ boxed{376} ]"},{"instruction":"Consider a crankslider mechanism (1crank, 2rod).

We need to carefully read the question and use the probability formula for equally likely events appropriately. To find the probability, we'll determine the total number of possible events and the number of favorable events (i.e., the sum is an even number). First, we have 4 identical red envelopes with face values of 5, 6, 8, and 10 yuan. When selecting 2 envelopes, the total number of possible events is n = C^2_4 = 6. To find favorable events, we need to consider combinations that result in an even sum. The sum of two integers is even if both integers are either even or odd. In this case, we have three even-numbered envelopes (6, 8, and 10 yuan) and one odd-numbered envelope (5 yuan). So, we can have the following combinations with an even sum: 1. (6 yuan, 8 yuan) 2. (6 yuan, 10 yuan) 3. (8 yuan, 10 yuan) Thus, the number of favorable events is m = C^2_3 = 3.

If line PQ is perpendicular to the xaxis and intersects with curve E at another point Q, and line AQ intersects with line PF at point B, prove that point B is always on curve E, and find the maximum area of Delta PAB.","output":"(1) From the problem, we know that the coordinates of point F are (1,0). Since point P is on the perpendicular bisector of CF', we have |PF'|=|PC|. Also, |PC|+|PF|=4, so |PF'|+|PF|=4 > |FF'|=2. By the definition of an ellipse, 2a=4 and c=1. Therefore, the trajectory equation E of moving point P is frac{x^2}{4}+frac{y^2}{3}=1. (2) Proof: Assume the coordinates of point P are (m,n) (nneq 0), then the coordinates of point Q are (m,-n), and 3m^2+4n^2=12. Thus, line QA: y=frac{n}{4-m}(x-4), or nx-(4-m)y-4n=0. And line PF: y=frac{n}{m-1}(x-1), or nx-(m-1)y-n=0. Solving the system of equations begin{cases} nx-(4-m)y-4n=0  nx-(m-1)y-n=0 end{cases}, we get (x_B=frac{5m-8}{2m-5},y_B=frac{3n}{2m-5}). Then, frac{x_B^2}{4}+frac{y_B^2}{3}=frac{(5m-8)^2}{4(2m-5)^2}+frac{(3n)^2}{3(2m-5)^2}=frac{25m^2-80m+64+36n^2}{4(2m-5)^2}=frac{16m^2-80m+100}{4(2m-5)^2}=1. Therefore, point B is always on ellipse E. Assuming line PF: x=ty+1, and P(x_1,y_1), B(x_2,y_2), from begin{cases} x=ty+1  3x^2+4y^2=12 end{cases}, eliminating x, we get (3t^2+4)y^2+6ty-9=0. So, y_1+y_2=-frac{6t}{3t^2+4}, y_1y_2=-frac{9}{3t^2+4}. Thus, |y_1-y_2|=sqrt{(y_1+y_2)^2-4y_1y_2}=sqrt{(frac{6t}{3t^2+4})^2+frac{36}{3t^2+4}}=frac{12sqrt{t^2+1}}{3t^2+4}. Hence, S_{Delta PAB}=frac{1}{2}|FA||y_1-y_2|=frac{18sqrt{t^2+1}}{3t^2+4}=frac{18}{3sqrt{t^2+1}+frac{1}{sqrt{t^2+1}}}. Let mu=sqrt{t^2+1} (mugeq1), then the function g(mu)=3mu+frac{1}{mu} is monotonically increasing on [1,+infty), and g(mu)_{min}=g(1)=4. Therefore, S_{Delta PAB}leqfrac{18}{4}=frac{9}{2}.

Can the police officer always achieve this?","output":"1. **Understand the Setup:**    - We have a square with a policeman at the center and a gangster at one of the vertices.    - The gangster can only move along the sides of the square, while the policeman can move anywhere within the square.    - The maximum speed of the gangster is (2.9) times the maximum speed of the policeman. 2. **Assumptions and Goals:**    - Let the side length of the square be denoted as (a).    - The task is to prove if the policeman can always meet the gangster on one of the sides of the square, despite the gangster's higher speed. 3. **Relative Speeds and Distances:**    - The distance from the center of the square to any vertex is (frac{a sqrt{2}}{2}).    - The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of any side is (frac{a}{2}). 4. **Policeman’s Strategy:**    - The shortest distance the policeman needs to travel to reach a side of the square is (frac{a}{2}).    - Let the speed of the policeman be (v). Hence, the time for the policeman to reach a side is (frac{frac{a}{2}}{v} = frac{a}{2v}). 5. **Gangster’s Movement:**    - In the same amount of time (t = frac{a}{2v}), the gangster can cover a distance of (2.9v cdot t = 2.9v cdot frac{a}{2v} = 1.45a). 6. **Validating the Strategy:**    - The gangster, starting from a vertex, can move along the perimeter of the square a distance of (1.45a) while the policeman reaches the side.    - As the perimeter of the square is (4a), covering (1.45a) would typically place the gangster within a side length (a). 7. **Conclusion:**    - No matter how the gangster moves along the sides of the square, the policeman can reach a side of the square since:      [      frac{a}{2v} < 1.45a      ]    - This time disparity ensures that the policeman could always manage to catch up with the gangster as the latter tries to evade.
